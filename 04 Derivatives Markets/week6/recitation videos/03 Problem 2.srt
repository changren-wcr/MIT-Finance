1
00:00:00,552 --> 00:00:02,510
PROFESSOR: Well, that wraps up the first topic.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,600
Let's move on to the second topic of this recitation,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,970
Black's model.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,130
Recall from the Week 6 lecture that we

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,360
can price European options on futures contracts using

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,620
Black's model.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,990
A version of the Black-Scholes-Merton model

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:24,150
that assumes that futures prices are log-normally distributed.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,220
Let's see how we can use Black's model to price a European call

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,645
option on a bond.

11
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:32,369


12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,170
Let's assume that a European call

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,840
option with 10 months to expiration

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,610
is written on a bond with 9.75 years to maturity,

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:48,780
a face value of $1,000, and a semi-annual coupon of $50.

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,110
Furthermore, assume that the futures price of the bond

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,950
is $939.68, the strike price of the European call option

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,640
is $1,000, or the face value of the bond,

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,730
and the risk-free rate for the next 10 months is 10%.

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,340


21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,030
If the volatility of the futures bond price is 9% annually,

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,550
what would be the price of the call option

23
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,960
according to Black's model?

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,560
We'll begin by recalling that according

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,980
to Black's model, the price of a European call

26
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,660
option on a futures contract with strike price, K, futures

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,480
price, F, risk-free rate, r, and volatility of the futures

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,570
price, sigma, is equal to c, the price of the call option,

29
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,340
is equal to e to the negative r times T,

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,720
times the difference between the futures price F,

31
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,150
times N evaluated at d1, minus the strike price K,

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:02,840
times N evaluated at d2, where d1 and d2 are defined similarly

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,710
as in the Black-Scholes-Merton model, only this time instead

34
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,500
of the spot price of the underlying asset,

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,580
we have the futures price, F.

36
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,000
As noted in the Week 6 lecture, this pricing formula

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,080
for Black's model is identical to that of the European call

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,890
option on the stock according to the Black-Scholes-Merton model

39
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,240
except that as noted earlier, we substitute the futures price

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,600
F for the stock price and set the dividend yield

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,270
equal to the risk-free rate.

42
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,430
From here, solving the problem is pretty mechanical.

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,950
All we need to do is plug-in for the strike price K, $1,000,

44
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,140
for the futures price F, $939.68,

45
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,330
for the risk-free rate, r, 0.1 for 10%, for, sigma,

46
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,240
the volatility of the futures price, 0.09 or 9%,

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,260
and for T, the time to maturity, 10 divided

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,690
by 12 for 10 months, which is equal to 0.8333

49
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:25,010
into the expressions for d1, d2, and c, that we just derived.

50
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:31,390
Doing so, we can solve analytically for d1, d2, and c.

51
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,530
However, it's probably easier to just input the parameters

52
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,560
into the corresponding cells in the Black's model

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,570
tab of the BSM in Black's Model.xls spreadsheet.

54
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,450
This will allow us to find the price of the European call

55
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,770
option directly.

56
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,990
Doing so will yield a price of $9.49.

57
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,000
