00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,580
PROFESSOR: Without further ado, let's

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,990
begin with the first topic--

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,780
implied volatility.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,850
In the week 6 lecture, we saw how

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,870
the Black-Scholes-Merton model can

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,860
be used to infer the volatilities of underlying

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,990
stock prices.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,690
These so-called implied volatilities--

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,410
that is, volatilities that are reverse engineered

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,470
in the Black-Scholes-Merton model using observed options

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,760
prices--

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,850
are forward looking measures of market uncertainty

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,790
about future returns, and are typically

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,370
less variable than options prices themselves.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,760
For example, consider a European call option

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,720
on a non dividend paying stock with spot price, S,

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,640
equal to 21, strike price, K, equal to 20,

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,420
risk-free rate, r, equal to 10%, and time

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,140
to expiration, T minus t, equal to 0.25.

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,810
Recall the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing formula

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,510
for a European call option, given in equation 1 below.

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,480
The price of the call option on the left hand side

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,730
is equal to the spot price, S, times the cumulative density

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,270
function of a standard normal random variable evaluated

25
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,310
at d1, minus K, the strike price of the option, times

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:34,630
e to the negative r times T minus t,

27
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,070
times N evaluated at d2.

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,590
Now, suppose that the market price of the call option,

29
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,080
which we'll call C, is equal to 1.875.

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,550
How can we use equation 1 to find sigma, the volatility

31
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,760
of the underlying stock price?

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,420
While it's generally impossible to invert equation 1 in order

33
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:06,890
to solve for sigma as a function of S, K, r, T, and C,

34
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,630
we can numerically iterate on sigma using the BSM and Black's

35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,200
Model.xls spreadsheet.

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,100
In particular, let's begin by guessing an initial value

37
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,840
for sigma, say 0.3 or 30%.

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,010
Plugging these parameters into the BSM tab of the spreadsheet,

39
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,900
we calculate a call price of $2.10.

40
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,320
The inputs and output of the spreadsheet are in the figure

41
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,450
below.

42
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,830
Clearly, the call price of 2.10 is too high,

43
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,490
relative to the market price of 1.875.

44
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,248
So what value of sigma should we try next?

45
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:52,540
Well, since we know that the price of the European call

46
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,230
option is increasing the volatility of the underlying

47
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,190
stock price, we should try a smaller value of sigma--

48
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,800
say, 0.2.

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,670
Doing so yields a call price of 1.76,

50
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:14,000
which is now too low relative to the market price of 1.875.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,820
We can repeat the above procedure, plugging

52
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:24,630
in a value of sigma somewhere between 0.2 and 0.3, say 0.25.

53
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,400
Depending on whether the calculated call

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,190
price is above or below the market price,

55
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,400
we adjust our input of sigma upward or downward,

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,580
iterating until the calculated call price is close

57
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,950
enough to the market price.

58
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,850
The resulting value of sigma will be the implied volatility

59
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,870
of the call option.

60
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,960
This iterative method can be pretty tedious to implement

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,650
by hand, though.

62
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,350
Is there a faster way to find the optimal input of sigma?

63
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,800
The answer, unsurprisingly, is yes.

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,280
In particular, one way to efficiently calculate

65
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,040
the implied volatility of the call option

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,960
is to use Microsoft Excel's solver tool.

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,090
In order to retrieve the solver tool,

68
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,690
first load the Solver add-in, and then open Solver

69
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,790
under the Analysis group in the Data tab.

70
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,330
In the pop up menu, define the objective

71
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,110
to be the cell corresponding to the value of the call option--

72
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,160
in this case, cell D16.

73
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,300
We want to change the variable in the cell corresponding

74
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,240
to sigma, such that the call option has

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,100
a value equal to its market price of 1.875.

76
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:53,000
So we want to set the objective to the value of 1.875.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,120
The changing variable cell, D9, is

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,320
going to be the sigma, or volatility of the underlying

79
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,410
stock price.

80
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,570
After running the solver, you should

81
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,390
find that an optimal value of sigma equal to 0.235

82
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,820
will yield the value of the call option

83
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,920
that is approximately equal to its market price of 1.875.

84
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,730
In other words, the implied volatility of the call option

85
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,970
is 23.5% per annum.

86
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,950
The output of the solver is displayed in this figure below.

87
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,370
In principle, one could also use a similar procedure

88
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,420
with binomial trees to compute the implied volatilities

89
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,720
of American options.
