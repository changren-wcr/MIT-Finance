1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,060
PROFESSOR: Topic two was brief, so let's finish the recitation

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,320
by reviewing currency options.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,960
Currency options are actually conceptually quite

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,080
similar to the options on stocks and futures

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,900
that we've seen in lectures so far.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,930
A currency option gives the holder of the option

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,450
the right, but not the obligation,

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,260
to buy or sell a certain currency at a predetermined

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,190
exchange rate on or before a specific date, maturity

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,390
date of the option.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,960
Are there a Black-Scholes-Merton type formula

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,590
analogous to those used to price call and put options

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,770
on stocks for European currency options?

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,650
We'll begin by recalling from the week five lecture

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,510
that the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,240
formula for European call and put

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,650
options on the stock with a known dividend yield, delta,

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,340
are as follows.

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,540
On the left hand side, we have the price of a European call

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,530
option for a stock with a known dividend yield, delta,

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,610
on the right hand side, the price of the put option with d1

22
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,970
and d2 given as the usual formulas,

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,210
except we have this adjustment and this term

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,550
here for the dividend yield.

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,970
The key to pricing currency options

26
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,120
is to realize that foreign currency is

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,860
analogous to a stock that pays a known dividend yield.

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,160
In particular, the holder of the foreign currency

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,600
will receive a dividend yield equal to the risk-free rate,

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,190
rf, in the foreign currency.

31
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,160
To keep the notation consistent, let's define

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,670
S to be the spot exchange rate.

33
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,800
In particular, S is the value of one unit of a foreign currency

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,120
in terms of US dollars.

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,090
Then the prices of the European call and put currency options

36
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,140
are the exact same as those for a stock with a known dividend

37
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,970
yield, except now we replace delta, the dividend yield,

38
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,850
with the foreign risk-free rate, rf.

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,020
On the left hand side, we have the price of a European call

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,260
currency option, where if you notice,

41
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,910
the dividend yield delta has been

42
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,345
replaced with rf and the same thing for the put option.

43
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:29,890


44
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,410
Both the domestic risk-free rate, r,

45
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,780
and the foreign risk-free rate, rf,

46
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,350
are for maturity, T, of the option here.

47
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,610
As a concrete example, consider a six month European call

48
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,690
option on the British pound.

49
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,190
Suppose that the spot exchange rate, S, is 1.5,

50
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,450
the strike price is also 1.5, the risk-free rate

51
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,990
in the United States is 5% per annum,

52
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,130
the risk-free rate in the United Kingdom is 7% per annum,

53
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,620
and the pound to dollar exchange rate

54
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,710
has a volatility of 12% per annum.

55
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,370
What would be the price of the call option in dollars

56
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,220
according to the equations above?

57
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,450
Using the Black-Scholes-Merton tab of the BSM and Black's

58
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,410
Model xls spreadsheet that we saw in topic one,

59
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,860
we can calculate the price of the European call option

60
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,060
with S, the spot exchange rate, equal to 1.5,

61
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,390
K, the strike price, equal to 1.5,

62
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,710
r, the domestic risk-free rate, equal to 5%,

63
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,030
sigma, the volatility of the exchange rate, equal to 12%,

64
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,240
and delta, which is our dividend yield, in this case,

65
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,530
the foreign risk-free rate equal to 7%,

66
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,970
and finally T, the maturity of the currency option,

67
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,400
equal to 0.5 for six months.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,070
Plugging those input into the Black-Scholes-Merton

69
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:09,350
calculator, we find a price of the currency call option

70
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,390
to be $0.042.

71
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,220
Finally, let's now assume that the six month forward exchange

72
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,220
rate, F, between pounds and dollars

73
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,270
is the same as the strike price, K, of the European call option.

74
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,310
Armed with this information, what

75
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,950
would be the price of a six month European

76
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,810
put option on the pound?

77
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,240
We actually don't need any other information

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
in order to solve this problem.

79
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,380
From put-call parity, note that we can relate European call

80
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,010
and put prices on currency options as follows.

81
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,290
On the left hand side, the price of a European call option

82
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,510
plus the strike price of the option times the exponential

83
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:05,270
of negative r times t, where r is the domestic risk-free rate,

84
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,860
is equal to the put price plus the spot exchange

85
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,630
rate times e to the negative rf T, where rf

86
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,390
is the foreign risk-free rate.

87
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,700
Back in the week one lecture, we learned

88
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,580
the following very important relationship

89
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,940
between the forward exchange rate, F, and the spot exchange

90
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,740
rate, S. In particular, the forward exchange rate

91
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,760
is equal to the spot exchange rate times the exponential

92
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,030
of the difference between the domestic risk-free rate,

93
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,690
r, and the foreign risk-free rate, rf,

94
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:48,070
times T, the maturity of the option.

95
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,470
Combining these two equations, we

96
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:57,080
have that the price of the call option plus the strike price

97
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,930
times e to negative rt, the left hand

98
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,570
side of our put-call parity relationship

99
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,550
on the top of the slide, is equal to the put price

100
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:13,710
plus the forward exchange rate, F, times e to the negative rt.

101
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,190
So we substitute for Se to the negative rfT

102
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,950
using a relationship between the forward exchange rate

103
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,750
and the spot exchange rate.

104
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,980
Clearly from this equation here at the bottom of the slide,

105
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,030
if K is equal to F, so if the strike price is

106
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,560
equal to the forward price, c, the price of the call option,

107
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,750
is equal to p, the price of the put option.

108
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,470
So the price of the European put option

109
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,350
is the same as the price of a European call option.

110
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,630
This result is going to hold generically

111
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,820
for options on any underlying asset, not just exchange rates,

112
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,310
as long as the strike price is equal to the forward price.

113
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,460
That concludes recitation six.

114
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,860
Thank you everyone for coming, and I look forward

115
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,310
to seeing you next week.
