00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,330
PROFESSOR: We're now going to switch gears and take

1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,860
a look at some of the other options

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,840
pricing models that were derived using

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,090
similar logic to Black-Scholes-Merton

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,150
but that take into account the special features of stock

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,800
indices, currencies, and options on futures.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,450
Last week, we saw that it just takes

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,090
a minor adjustment of the original Black-Scholes-Merton

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,720
model to incorporate a known dividend or a known dividend

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,440
yield.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,800
Now we're returning to this idea and expanding on it.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,850
For a stock index, the dividend yield is usually fairly stable

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,220
at least over moderate periods of time

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,310
and it's well-approximated by a constant we'll call q.

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,520
Formulas for the price of a put or call option on a stock price

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,910
index then is shown here.

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,440
Notice that the higher the dividend yield, q,

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,260
the higher the value of a put option and the lower

18
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,520
the value of a call option, holding all else equal.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,350
That's because the dividend yield

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,349
reduces the average growth rate of the stock price.

21
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,400
That average growth rate is r minus q in a risk-neutral world

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,540
and it shows up here in the equation.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,660
You can verify for yourself that if the dividend yield is

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,290
set to 0, the formula is identical to the original

25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,090
Black-Scholes-Merton formula.

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,340
The value of a put option on the index

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,340
can be found using the put-call parity relationship shown here,

28
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,230
which is also adjusted for the presence of a constant dividend

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,430
yield.

30
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,850
It's also noteworthy that you can use this put-call parity

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,480
relationship to solve for the implied dividend

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,070
yield on the index given the market price of a put and call

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,580
option and taking the other inputs into the model as known.

34
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,910
A similar variation on the original Black-Scholes-Merton

35
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,840
formula can be used to price European options on currencies.

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,150
It has to account for the implicit dividend

37
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,540
stream on the foreign currency because the currency can

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,220
be invested in a risk-free bond paying a rate we call rf where

39
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,270
here the subscript f stands for foreign

40
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,240
rather than the more familiar risk-free.

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,730
Well, another way to understand the adjustment

42
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,050
is because of a no-arbitrage condition

43
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,090
which is known as covered interest rate parity.

44
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,060
That states that a foreign currency that pays a higher

45
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,070
interest rate relative to the dollar

46
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,250
must have a correspondingly lower rate of appreciation

47
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,600
against the dollar.

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,170
Else, there'd be an arbitrage opportunity.

49
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,520
Well, let's define S0 as the current spot exchange rate

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,610
and, to be precise, S0 is the value

51
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,840
of 1 unit of foreign currency in US dollars.

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,020
So for example, if the exchange rate

53
00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:00,440
implies that you get one euro per $1.1, then S0 is 1.1.

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,140
Notice, though, that this relationship will

55
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,300
be true for any currency pair.

56
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,690
It need not involve the dollar or the euro.

57
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,840
So it's important to keep in mind that the underlying

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,900
asset here is consistently being described

59
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,360
as the foreign currency.

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,880
That means that the call option formula treats

61
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,530
the currency that's being delivered

62
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,900
in the contract as the foreign currency,

63
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,090
and the put option formula similarly

64
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,950
treats the currency that's being delivered

65
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,000
in the contract as the foreign currency.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,490
Now looking at the pricing formula

67
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,730
for the call option and the put-call parity relationship

68
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,090
here, you can immediately see that these

69
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,480
are the same formulas as we used for a stock

70
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,600
with a constant dividend yield where

71
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,060
the risk-free rate on the foreign currency

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,050
is used in place of the assumed dividend yield.

73
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,660
Options on futures contracts are known as futures options.

74
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,090
They can also be priced using the variant

75
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,310
of the original Black-Scholes-Merton formula

76
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,210
that incorporates a constant dividend yield.

77
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,990
To preview the bottom line that comes out of the analysis,

78
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,170
it will turn out that the dividend yield in this case

79
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,100
will be set equal to the risk-free rate.

80
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,630
Well, futures options have a number of potential advantages

81
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,750
over options on the spot market assets,

82
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,810
and that makes them very popular.

83
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,850
One is the liquidity of futures contracts,

84
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,720
which may far exceed the liquidity of the underlying

85
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,320
asset.

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,040
Another advantage is that exercising the option

87
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,860
never leads to having to deliver or receive

88
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,740
an underlying asset that one doesn't want

89
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,280
or that's very costly to transfer.

90
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,470
Because futures options typically

91
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,440
trade on the same exchange as the underlying futures

92
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,070
contract, there can also be additional efficiencies

93
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,480
such as an reduced margin requirement.

94
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,380
A useful fact is that European futures options

95
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,890
and European spot options will be equivalent

96
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,220
when the futures contract matures at the same time

97
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,200
as the option expires.

98
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,620
That's because, as we saw, the futures price always

99
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,210
converges to the cash price at the futures contract expiration

100
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,650
date.

101
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,020
A futures call option confers the right

102
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,110
to enter into some number of long futures contracts

103
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,230
at a prespecified futures price, K.

104
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,650
If the option is exercised, the holder gets two things--

105
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,690
first, a long position in the specified number of currently

106
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,730
priced futures contracts and second, the cash difference

107
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,310
between the most recent settlement price on the futures

108
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,340
contracts and the strike price specified

109
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,560
in the futures option.

110
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,290
The effective payoff per futures contract

111
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:07,060
turns out to be the maximum of the futures price

112
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,130
minus the strike price and 0.

113
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,960
Now, notice that this just reflects

114
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,510
the second item, the cash difference

115
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,360
between the current futures price and the strike price.

116
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,160
Why is that?

117
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,820
It's because the currently priced futures contract

118
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,300
is always worth 0 as we learned way back at the beginning

119
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,810
of this course.

120
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,210
A futures put option is similar.

121
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,150
It confers the right to enter into a short futures

122
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,030
contract at a prespecified futures price,

123
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,930
K. If it's exercised, the holder gets a currently priced

124
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,510
short position in the futures contracts

125
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,690
and receives the cash difference between the strike price

126
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,660
and the most recent futures settlement price.

127
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,430
The effective payoff then is the maximum of the strike price

128
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,880
minus the futures price and 0.

129
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,180
It's also worth noting that popular futures options

130
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,310
contracts include agricultural commodities, energy, metals,

131
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,010
and all sorts of interest rates.

132
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,260
Also note that most futures options

133
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,530
are American, not European.

134
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,510
A very famous and frequently used

135
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,600
formula for pricing various types of futures options

136
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,400
is called Black's model.

137
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,040
It's also frequently used for pricing commodity options.

138
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,520
In fact, one of its advantages in that context

139
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,760
is that by focusing on the forward price at expiration,

140
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,640
it eliminates the need to model the convenience yield

141
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,090
or carrying cost over the life of the options contract.

142
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,520
Some cautions, though, the formula

143
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,290
is for European options.

144
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,570
Hence, you shouldn't really rely on it

145
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,700
when the futures option is American,

146
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,840
and there's the possibility that early exercise will be optimal.

147
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,240
A further caution is that the formula will only

148
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,540
be appropriate for commodities whose forward price can

149
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,520
be reasonably modeled as being log-normally distributed.

150
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,730
We'll see later how it's used for fixed income options,

151
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,170
including pricing short-dated options on bonds and interest

152
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,080
rate caps and floors.

153
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,450
Well, if you look closely at Black's model, which

154
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,710
is shown here, you'll see that it's

155
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,260
equivalent to the model for pricing stock

156
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,960
options with a constant dividend yield

157
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,780
where the dividend yield term is set to be

158
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,920
equal to the risk-free rate.

159
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,950
The intuition behind that adjustment

160
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,429
has to do with the formula for the futures price, which

161
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,659
we know is the spot price multiplied by the future value

162
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,500
factor.

163
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,490
Then with the passage of time, the future value factor

164
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,070
is going to shrink at the rate, r.

165
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,370
That shrinkage has the same effect

166
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,240
as that of a dividend yield on the price of a stock.

167
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,050
Hence, it enters in the same way into the options pricing

168
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,620
formula.

169
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,050
Stepping back, I've introduced all

170
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,030
of these formulas for pricing options

171
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,900
on stock indices, currencies, and futures options

172
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,330
because it's useful for you to know

173
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,840
that they're available and quite straightforward to implement.

174
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,610
You can also use them for setting up

175
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,970
delta and delta gamma hedging strategies using

176
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,640
exactly the same logic as in the example we started with today.
