00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,960
PROFESSOR: This week, our main topic

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,170
will be volatility, which is one of the most important drivers

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,690
of option value and, of course, what motivates

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,880
people to trade options and other derivatives

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,270
in the first place.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,470
I also want to introduce you to some useful options

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,460
pricing models that are variants on Black-Scholes Merton.

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,160
Before we turn to those other pricing models

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,650
and to volatility, we'll finish up

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,920
on our discussion from last week on hedging with the Greeks

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,650
and we'll learn to implement delta-gamma hedging.

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,670
The other options pricing models that I want to briefly cover

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,330
include variations on BSM that are frequently

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,250
used to price options on stock indices, options on currencies,

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,530
and options on futures.

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,290
We won't go into detail derivations,

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,320
but it's useful for you to be aware of these models

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,450
and understand how to use them.

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,550
Then we'll turn to volatility.

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,550
We'll start by seeing that the simple Black-Scholes Merton

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,180
framework, with its constant volatility assumption,

22
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,260
can't completely explain observed option prices.

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,050
We'll get a better read on the market's perception

24
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,720
of volatility through the concept of implied volatility.

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,510
We'll also see how implied volatilities

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,160
go into constructing the VIX, a widely watched index of stock

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,330
market volatility that's also, itself, directly traded

28
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,830
in risk management strategies.

29
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,370
Finally, we'll look at some of the approaches

30
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,230
that have been developed to incorporate

31
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,780
the variation in volatility over time

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,500
and how they can be used to create better options pricing

33
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,050
models.
