1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,120
PROFESSOR: In the context of the Black-Scholes-Merton model,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,390
implied volatility is defined as the level of the volatility

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,890
parameter, sigma, such that given the other formula inputs,

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,790
the model price for an option matches its market price.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,820
For example, say we know from the table we looked

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,880
at earlier today that the market price of a put option

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,470
with a strike price of $1,500 and a time to expiration

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,370
of 0.12 is equal to $20.35.

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,690
We can find the implied volatility, sigma sub

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,180
imp, where "imp" stands for implied,

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,760
by using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,310
for the price of a put calibrated

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,820
with the other inputs we know and solving it

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,390
for sigma sub imp that's consistent with that observed

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,340
market price of the option.

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,070
Clearly this means that every option in the market

17
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,550
can potentially have a different implied volatility.

18
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,800
You may have heard the term volatility

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,530
smile or volatility smirk.

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,490
Those terms refer to the typical shape of implied volatility

21
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,680
when plotted as a function of the moneyness

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,900
of the underlying option, holding

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,110
all the parameters other than the strike price fixed.

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,680
For example, this figure shows that there is a volatility

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,800
smirk implied by the market prices for put options

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,350
given in the table we looked at earlier.

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,450
Had the implied volatility started

28
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,320
increasing for high levels of moneyness as sometimes happens,

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,190
it would have been described as a smile instead of a smirk.

30
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,010
For comparison, the volatility estimate

31
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,560
we saw based on the last three months of data

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,090
is also plotted on the graph, as is the volatility estimate that

33
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,750
comes out of just looking at the last month of data.

34
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,050
Under these market conditions, the implied volatilities

35
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,530
were all higher than the last month of historical volatility,

36
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,950
but similar on average to the historical volatility based

37
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,690
on a three month look back.

38
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,450
The relationship between implied volatility

39
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,190
and historical volatility can vary considerably over time.

40
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,280
That's because implied volatility is forward looking

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,710
and expectations about the future

42
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,960
can become quite different than what was

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,510
experienced in the recent past.

44
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,370
Estimates of implied volatility are

45
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,390
useful for several purposes.

46
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,810
One is simply to get a forward looking read on how

47
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,780
market participants gauge the amount of general market

48
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,310
uncertainty.

49
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,130
Higher uncertainty translates to higher options

50
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,330
prices, which in turn means higher implied volatilities.

51
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,360
Remember that Vega, the effect of volatility

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,330
on options prices, is always positive,

53
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,770
both for puts and calls.

54
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,200
The graph here compares implied volatilities,

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,900
indicated by the lighter dashed line,

56
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,080
to volatilities estimated using historical data,

57
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,640
the solid line.

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,640
The two series tend to track each other over time,

59
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,130
but sometimes there can be significant differences

60
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,600
between them.

61
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,430
A few regularities stand out.

62
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,580
One is that implied volatility tends

63
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,130
to be higher than historical volatility,

64
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,760
and that the difference becomes more pronounced during periods

65
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,650
where volatility is unusually high.

66
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,310
Those differences are consistent with options prices containing

67
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,380
a risk premium that isn't captured

68
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,008
by the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

69
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:23,800
I thought you might be interested in seeing

70
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,710
some more recent data on implied volatilities.

71
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:32,110
This graph plots the VIX from 2017 through October of 2021.

72
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,390
The VIX is the most commonly used measure

73
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,300
of implied volatility for the overall stock market

74
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,970
and we'll talk more about it shortly.

75
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,880
The graph shows that the stock market was relatively calm

76
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,190
over the earlier part of this period.

77
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,970
The onset of the COVID-19 panic caused implied volatility

78
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,030
to spike sharply, and then to stay elevated

79
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,780
over pre-pandemic levels.

80
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,300
A very practical use of implied volatility

81
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,550
is to look for profitable trading opportunities

82
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,500
in the options market.

83
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,350
If you look directly at the prices of options

84
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,900
with different maturities and strike prices,

85
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,210
it's impossible to directly evaluate

86
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,900
which are relatively expensive and which are relatively cheap.

87
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,030
With different strike prices, there

88
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,347
are differences in intrinsic value, which

89
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:19,680
is the difference between the stock price and the strike

90
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,519
price.

91
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,240
Those differences have a significant but variable effect

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,190
on the value of an option.

93
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,510
Different maturities are hard to compare

94
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,210
because that entails adjustments for time value and uncertainty.

95
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,150
For example, if you were to directly compare the market

96
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,770
price on May 3, 2007 of two of the put options we looked

97
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,080
at with maturity of 0.12, one with a strike price of $1,500

98
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,650
and another with a strike price of $1,475,

99
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,720
you would find $1.00 difference between them of $7.75.

100
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,700
You wouldn't know how much of a difference

101
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,490
to attribute to the $25 difference in their strike

102
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,420
prices and how much to attribute to something else.

103
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,460
Instead of looking directly at prices

104
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,400
to make value comparisons, you could take the data

105
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,000
and create what's called an implied volatility surface.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,490
An implied volatility surface plots

107
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,160
implied volatility on the vertical z-axis

108
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,820
of a three-dimensional graph with maturity and moneyness

109
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,100
on the x- and y-axis.

110
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,460
This can make it much clearer which options appear cheap

111
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,800
and which appear expensive.

112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,680
An option with a higher implied volatility compared

113
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,200
to its close neighbors on the volatility surface

114
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,630
are relatively expensive, controlling

115
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,050
for the most important sources of price variation.

116
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,500
Options that are significantly below the surface, that

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,980
have a relatively low implied volatility, are cheap.

118
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,770
A trading strategy then is to buy options

119
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,170
that seem significantly underpriced

120
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,720
and to sell options that appear to be significantly overpriced.

121
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,340
Be warned though, if you do this without hedging those trades,

122
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,280
you're very exposed to changes in market conditions

123
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,770
that affect the value of your position.

124
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,250
A more prudent strategy would be to delta or delta gamma

125
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,340
hedge those trades using liquid options

126
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,970
or a replicating portfolio of the underlying stock

127
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,280
or a combination of the two.

128
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,370
By hedging, you're then left with a pure bet

129
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,090
on the price of the overpriced or underpriced option moving

130
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,520
back in line with other options.

131
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,450
The VIX is an index of the S&P 500 implied volatility

132
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,090
based on options traded on the S&P 500

133
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,820
index at the CBOE with expirations

134
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,220
between 23 and 37 days.

135
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,540
Note that the VIX is based on an average across options

136
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,370
with different amounts of moneyness,

137
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,520
and that the individual implied volatilities on the underlying

138
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,470
contracts may differ significantly

139
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,050
from the average that's the VIX.

140
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,830
For that reason, the VIX is useful in trading strategies

141
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,670
based on general trends in stock market volatility.

142
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,670
Both futures and options are traded on the VIX.

143
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,480
And those derivatives can be used to hedge or to speculate.

144
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,880
A long position in volatility means

145
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,730
that you profit if volatility rises and vice

146
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,070
versa for short positions.

147
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,320
An example of using the VIX to hedge

148
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,140
would be for an index fund manager who's

149
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,920
compensated based on how closely his portfolio tracks the S&P

150
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,330
500 index.

151
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,720
Because tracking error tends to rise with volatility,

152
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,270
the manager can hedge his compensation

153
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,000
by buying a contract whose payoff increases

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,380
with volatility.

155
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,960
A speculative example is if you want

156
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,510
to make a directional bet on what will happen to market

157
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,630
volatility and you want to avoid a directional bet

158
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,450
on whether the market will rise or fall.

159
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,280
Recall that you can also use options

160
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,490
to bet on volatility using long and short positions

161
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,360
in straddles and strangles.
