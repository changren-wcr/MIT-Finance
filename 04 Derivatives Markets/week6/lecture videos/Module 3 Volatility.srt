00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
PROFESSOR: We're now going to switch gears one more time

1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,790
and turn to volatility, its effects on observed options

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,390
prices, and how to better incorporate it into our options

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,980
pricing models.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,990
Academics and practitioners, seeking

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,610
to improve options pricing models,

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,150
have focused a lot of energy on volatility modeling,

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,210
because the constant volatility assumption is a leading

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,760
candidate for why the Black-Scholes-Merton model

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,790
often fails to explain the options prices observed

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,080
in the market.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,930
We'll start by looking at an example that illustrates

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,790
the type of deviations that typically

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,710
arise between the Black-Scholes-Merton model

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,470
predictions and observed market prices.

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,140
We'll then look at approaches to volatility modeling that

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,900
have been developed to improve the accuracy of options pricing

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,620
models.

18
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,290
The example here is based on data

19
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,590
from May 3rd of 2007, which was a few months

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,900
before the onset of the global financial crisis

21
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,550
later that year.

22
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,160
The S&P 500 index was at 1502, the one-month risk free rate

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,349
was 4.713% on a continuously compounded basis,

24
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:11,270
the dividend yield on the S&P 500 was about 1.91%.

25
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,820
Those three inputs into options pricing models

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,490
can be observed fairly accurately.

27
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,670
The volatility, however, has to be estimated from data

28
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,060
or inferred from other options prices.

29
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,430
We'll start with an estimate of volatility,

30
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,760
based on using the previous three months of daily stock

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,460
returns.

32
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,630
The estimated volatility, then, is based, as usual,

33
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,170
on the average of a square deviation of daily returns

34
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,290
from their mean and we're only using observations

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,060
from trading days.

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,190
The daily volatility estimate is then

37
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,380
annualized by multiplying by the square root

38
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,600
of the number of trading days in a year, which

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,690
is taken to be 252 days.

40
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,480
The resulting estimate of annual volatility in the market

41
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,030
at that time was 12.36%.

42
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:03,750
Using those inputs, we can calculate the BSM prices

43
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,220
for some of the many put and call

44
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,340
options that were trading in the market on that day.

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,490
All of the options shown here have the same maturity date,

46
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,140
and hence the same time to expiration, which is 0.12.

47
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,840
They vary in their strike prices, which

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,430
range from 1430 down to 1575.

49
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,910
The current index value of 1,502.39

50
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,990
lies towards the middle of that available range of options.

51
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,980
The next column here shows the ratio of the strike prices

52
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,620
to the index value, which is known

53
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,300
as the moneyness of the option.

54
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,210
Then, both for puts and calls, we

55
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,600
have the market price, the Black-Scholes-Merton estimate

56
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,860
of what the price would be, and then

57
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,197
the ratio of the estimated price over the actual price.

58
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:02,030
There are several features of this data that

59
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,880
are quite noteworthy and actually typical

60
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,370
of the patterns observed in options prices.

61
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,090
Whereas the Black-Scholes-Merton model prices and market prices

62
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,680
are usually within a few percentage

63
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,510
points of each other for options that

64
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,750
are close to being at-the-money, that

65
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,070
isn't true for other strike prices.

66
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,490
For calls, the largest deviations are for deep

67
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,420
out-of-the-money options, where market values are considerably

68
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,030
lower than those predicted by the Black-Scholes-Merton

69
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,680
formula.

70
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,090
For puts, the largest deviations are for deep out-of-the-money

71
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,170
options, where market values are much higher than those

72
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,930
predicted by the Black-Scholes-Merton formula,

73
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,620
this region here.

74
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,270
The way we're going to interpret this is that it indicates that,

75
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,060
despite the fact that Black-Scholes-Merton prices are

76
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,090
based on a no-arbitrage strategy of dynamic trading

77
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,710
in a replicating portfolio, traders' valuations in fact

78
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,690
seem conservative or pessimistic in the following sense:

79
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,480
the market puts a higher value on the protection value

80
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,900
of out-of-the-money puts against large downward price movements

81
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,140
than predicted by the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

82
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,470
The market is also conservative in treating the upside obtained

83
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,410
from out-of-the-money call options as worth less than

84
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,530
the BSM model predicts.

85
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,300
A slightly different way to characterize

86
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,100
the patterns observed in the table

87
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,460
is to focus on the concept of moneyness.

88
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,600
Again, moneyness is the ratio of the strike price to the index

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,670
price, K/S. The table shows that, for both puts and calls,

90
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,660
for options with low moneyness, the Black-Scholes-Merton model

91
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,050
seems to underprice the options, whereas for options

92
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,210
with high moneyness, Black-Scholes-Merton

93
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,690
seems to overprice the options.

94
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,780
This observation is also consistent

95
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,980
with the pessimistic view that the likelihood of very negative

96
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,760
stock returns is higher than what the BSM model assumes,

97
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,520
and that the likelihood of extremely high returns

98
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,810
is lower.

99
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,870
To account for these systematic discrepancies between observed

100
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,540
and model prices, the natural starting point

101
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,960
is to more closely examine the inputs that go into the model.

102
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,730
We have six of these to consider: the strike price,

103
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,580
the time to expiration, the current stock

104
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,150
price, the interest rate, the dividend yield, and volatility.

105
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,850
The first two inputs are specified in the options

106
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,250
contract, and the current stock price is easily observable.

107
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,250
Interest rates and dividend yields are also observable

108
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,600
and they don't vary too much over time.

109
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,310
Moreover, their variation has an opposite effect

110
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,610
on calls and on puts but we saw that mispricing

111
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,520
went in the same direction for puts and calls.

112
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,330
That leaves volatility, then, as the most likely suspect

113
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,920
on our list.

114
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,750
It's harder to predict, and we'll

115
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,440
see that it changes significantly over time.

116
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,500
However, as we'll see on the next slide,

117
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,140
the average level of mispricing may

118
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,250
be related to inaccuracies in our volatility estimate

119
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,280
but adjusting that alone can't explain

120
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,250
why the Black-Scholes-Merton model under-prices out

121
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,100
of the money puts and over-prices in the money

122
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,010
puts, and vice versa for calls.

123
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,840
Hence, we need to consider what else

124
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,710
could explain the mispricing.

125
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,410
The list of additional suspects include

126
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,850
various possible violations of our frictionless markets

127
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,310
assumption, that goes into deriving

128
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,740
the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

129
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,610
Those include limits on dynamic hedging, discontinuous stock

130
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,050
price paths, or other deviations from log normality,

131
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,680
transactions costs, and limits to shorting.

132
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,740
Taken together, these all suggest

133
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,270
that pricing can't be purely done by no arbitrage.

134
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,760
A risk premium also affects option values.

135
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,010
That leaves us with some practical questions

136
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,270
to try to answer.

137
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,850
First, which of these frictions is important enough

138
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,480
to impact pricing?

139
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,870
And how do we need to modify our pricing models

140
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,080
to make them more accurate?

141
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,150
The simplest fix would be if it were simply

142
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,580
a matter of having estimated the volatility

143
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,460
parameter differently than what other market participants were

144
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,980
doing.

145
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,790
Recall, we looked at three months of recent daily returns,

146
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,370
calculated the standard deviation,

147
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,950
and annualized the estimate.

148
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,490
That procedure is intrinsically backwards-looking,

149
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,680
and perhaps traders that were forward-looking

150
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,020
came to a different conclusion about

151
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,240
the appropriate volatility parameter

152
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,890
for the life of the option.

153
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,700
To test this hypothesis, this table

154
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,290
recalculates all of the Black-Scholes-Merton prices

155
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,490
for the puts and calls in this table, but under the assumption

156
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,300
that sigma is 11.5 instead of the 12.4

157
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,810
that was estimated earlier.

158
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,710
The 11.5 was chosen so that the Black-Scholes-Merton model

159
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,330
would correctly price at-the-money options.

160
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,410
As you can see, that change doesn't affect the conclusion

161
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,800
that the Black-Scholes-Merton formula under-prices options

162
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,140
with low moneyness and overprices

163
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,150
those with high moneyness.

164
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,330
We'll need to look further for explanations of these price

165
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,708
patterns.

166
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,208
