00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690


1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,420
PROFESSOR: It's well-known that the lognormal model for stock

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,000
prices fails to accurately capture

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,900
the historical distribution of observed stock prices.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,760
The empirical distribution has what's known as "fatter tails."

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,720
That is, there's a higher chance of very large negative returns

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,320
and also a higher chance of very high returns

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,410
than the best fit of a lognormal distribution to the data

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,760
would imply.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,850
Remember also that, if prices are lognormally distributed,

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,040
then returns--

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,140
inclusive of dividends-- are normally distributed.

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,100
That fact is illustrated in the graph where the red bars are

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,250
from the histogram constructed from a stock market return

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,790
data.

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,390
The smooth graph is the fitted distribution of returns,

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,940
assuming a normal distribution.

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,330
You can see that the fitted distribution attributes

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,790
too low a probability to the tails

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,830
of the empirical distribution.

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,680
It's hard to tell from the previous graph exactly how

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,530
large the tail deviations are from what

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,780
would be expected if returns were normally distributed.

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,240
This interesting table is from an article

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,730
on the website Seeking Alpha.

25
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,110
It shows the number of expected versus realized occurrences

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,630
of daily stock market realizations

27
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,930
that are greater than 1 standard deviation, 2

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,830
standard deviations, et cetera, going all the way out

29
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,240
to 9 standard deviations.

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,260
It shows that there are 163 events that

31
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,680
exceeded 4 standard deviations based on the best

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,340
fit of a normal distribution versus the 1 event

33
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,120
the theory predicts would be that large.

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,430
Consistent then with the previous graph,

35
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,860
it also shows that the frequency of moves

36
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,230
that are less than 1 standard deviation

37
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,770
are more likely than is captured by a normal distribution.

38
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,590
These sorts of tabulations have led researchers

39
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,930
to consider fat-tailed distributions--

40
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,120
like the student's t-distribution

41
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,120
or the Laplace distribution-- as candidates

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,250
to better fit the data.

43
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,230
To what extent the value of the stock market

44
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,690
moves smoothly over time is a topic

45
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,930
of debate among academic economists.

46
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,110
Well, even if stock prices are in some theoretical sense

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,870
continuous, as a practical matter,

48
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,540
traders experience prices as having

49
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,030
sometimes significant jumps.

50
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,430
For example, there are periods when markets are closed--

51
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,120
such as overnight-- when price movements are unobservable

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,950
and by the time the markets reopen,

53
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,830
prices can be far different than they were at the previous day's

54
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,120
close.

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,150
And even as a theoretical matter, what moves

56
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,640
stock prices is new information.

57
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,130
If there is an announcement of an event that

58
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,780
affects the market broadly--

59
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,060
such as a surprise increase in inflation

60
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,900
or a fall in unemployment or a declaration of war--

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,330
those could all cause the index value to jump.

62
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,810
This graph plots high-frequency percentage price changes

63
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,690
for the US stock market over the same period

64
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,760
as shown in the previous graph.

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,950
Clearly, there are episodes that appear

66
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,730
to be jumps that range from about minus 20% to positive

67
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,670
15%.

68
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,270
For individual stocks, which trade far less frequently,

69
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,760
there can be many sources of new information

70
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,500
that significantly move the price

71
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,420
and thereby can create a jump.

72
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,150
You might expect that to happen, for instance, when

73
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,250
the company announces that it plans

74
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,850
on making a large acquisition or that it will itself

75
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,500
be acquired by another firm.

76
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,000
