1
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:02,570
PROFESSOR: Previously, we saw how

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,870
to find options prices given a binomial tree representing

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,850
stock price evolution.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,550
With implied trees, we start with some

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,480
observed options prices and calibrate the stock price

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
tree to be consistent with those prices.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,120
We can then use the tree to price other options.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,370
For example, consider a binomial tree

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,460
calibrated to be consistent with the example we've been looking

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,210
at for the S&P 500.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,570
We'll take the current index value to be 1502.4.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,930
Volatility will be 12.36.

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,900
The risk free rate is 4.713.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,390
The dividend yield is 1.91.

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,730
And the time to expiration of the option is 0.12.

16
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,910
Consistent with these parameters,

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:00,790
we would calibrate u to be e to the sigma root T, as usual.

18
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,880
And we would get 1.0437 for that.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,100
d is 1 over u.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,980
And then the risk neutral probability

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,530
is e to the risk free rate minus the dividend

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,100
yield times the time to expiration minus d,

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,600
over u minus d.

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,460
That gives you a q* of 0.5286.

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,350
Notice that the q* here looks a little different than it did

26
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,380
in our case when the dividend yield was 0.

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,615
Now we have to reduce the drift of the stock price by the fact

28
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:34,990
that the dividend yield is there,

29
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,430
as we've talked about before.

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:44,180
Well, the price, then, of an option with a strike of 1,500,

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,280
according to the model turns out to be 28.394.

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,010
And that's higher than what we saw was the traded market

33
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,440
price, which was 20.35.

34
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,810
As shown by the calculations we just went over

35
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,760
on the previous slide and using the tree

36
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,650
based on historical volatility shown here,

37
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,840
we get a price of the put of 28.394, which is

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,639
higher than its market value.

39
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,120
So instead of starting with historical volatility

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,640
as the basis for calibrating the tree model,

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,700
we can alter the binomial tree parameters

42
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,750
to reproduce the observed market prices of the put option.

43
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,330
On this slide, that procedure is described as choosing S1u,

44
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,470
which will imply a new value for u, d and q*.

45
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,830
You can think of choosing S1u as equivalent to choosing

46
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,790
an implied volatility from the observed option price.

47
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,830
In any case, you can solve for it using a computer program

48
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,110
to solve for the option price, where

49
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,850
you can iterate on S1u until you match the observed price.

50
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:57,970
This slide shows the tree with the value of S1u, 1551.26,

51
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,750
that results in the tree properly pricing the put option

52
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,110
at its market value of 2035.

53
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,510
Once we have the implied tree, we

54
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,240
can use it to price other options.

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,260
For instance, consider an option with a strike price of K

56
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:20,140
equal to 1490, the same time to maturity of 0.12.

57
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:26,260
The put price from the binomial tree for this option is 15.82.

58
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,900
And if we compare that to the market price

59
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,130
that we have in our table from earlier of 17.05,

60
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,430
we see that it's much closer than had we

61
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,760
tried to price it using our original tree, which

62
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,980
would have implied a large error with a price

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,970
prediction of 23.7.

64
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,370
Well, obviously, you want to choose options

65
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,710
in calibrating the tree with prices

66
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,080
that you think are representative of the market.

67
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,980
It's also possible, as you'll see in the recitation,

68
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,280
to extend this idea to a multi-step tree.

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,730
That provides the flexibility to treat the volatility

70
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,730
as varying over different future time periods.

71
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,400
That can capture the idea of mean reverting

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,180
volatility or other assumptions about its expected time

73
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,380
evolution.

74
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,019
We've covered a lot of useful ground this week,

75
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,390
and I hope you come away from it with a deeper

76
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,450
understanding of the drivers of options prices

77
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,130
and how they're modeled.

78
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,350
We've seen that the Black-Scholes-Merton formula

79
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,690
doesn't price options very accurately.

80
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,270
Given the strong assumptions that it relies on,

81
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,270
perhaps that's not too surprising.

82
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,430
More accurate estimates of option value

83
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,650
can be obtained by incorporating factors

84
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,040
such as stochastic volatility, jumps, and fatter

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,750
tailed distributions.

86
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,330
Still, the Black-Scholes-Merton model

87
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,520
is a very useful benchmark.

88
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,660
It gives decent approximations to prices close to the money.

89
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,260
And it typically is used for finding hedge ratios.

90
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,480
If you look at the quotations for options

91
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,820
at the CBOE and elsewhere, you'll

92
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,650
see that the Black-Scholes-Merton model has

93
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,200
become the industry standard for quoting options

94
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,240
in terms of implied volatility.

95
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,020
The BSM model is also used to construct implied volatility

96
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,540
surfaces that provide a simple way

97
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,120
to evaluate the relative value of options

98
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,730
and to look for potential profit opportunities

99
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,510
from temporary mispricing.

100
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,630
The more complicated models do fit the data better,

101
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,350
and you can use them for product pricing and trading strategies

102
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,760
where more accuracy is important.
