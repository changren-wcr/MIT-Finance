00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,958
PROFESSOR: We've seen some of the problems that

1
00:00:01,958 --> 00:00:04,170
can arise with delta hedging, namely,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,970
that for the hedge to be effective,

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,040
we need to rebalance the portfolio frequently,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,420
which is expensive because of transactions costs that include

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,460
the time it takes to make the trades,

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,520
and secondly, that the hedge can break down when there are

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,740
large changes in stock prices.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,310
As we saw, it caused the failure of portfolio insurance

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,610
strategies when the stock market crashed.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,850
Those problems can be alleviated, but not completely

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,970
avoided by delta-gamma hedging.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,750
delta-gamma hedging involves adding to the hedge portfolio

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,240
a security with a positive gamma.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,780
In the example here, we're using a long position

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,030
in a liquid short term traded option to do that.

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,050
We're choosing to use a short term traded option,

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,170
because they're highly liquid and readily available.

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,510
But other securities with a positive gamma

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,430
could have been used as well.

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,550
For an example of constructing the hedged position,

21
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,019
consider a portfolio we'll call I, which is short the cap

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,290
T dated call option, like the one that's embedded

23
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,720
in the capital protected note.

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,510
It's long, a fraction n in the stock index, which is currently

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,400
at s, and it's also long in the shorter dated call

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,620
option that matures the time t1 in an amount nc.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,310
So the short position in the call

28
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,020
is being hedged by these two long positions.

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,010
As before, we'll hedge the sensitivity of I

30
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,450
to changes in the stock price, which first means delta hedging

31
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,800
by setting di ds equal to 0.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
Now, though, we also want to hedge

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,540
against changes in delta, which we will

34
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,760
occur when stock prices change.

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,610
This implies also setting the second derivative

36
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,780
of the portfolio.

37
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,740
It's gamma equal to 0.

38
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,350
This graph is a reminder that the capital protected

39
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,410
note provided holders of that security with exposure

40
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,470
to the S&P 500, which was effectively

41
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,420
like what they would have been able to get

42
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,230
if they could buy a very long dated call option on the index.

43
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,790
The replicating portfolio used in a delta hedging strategy

44
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,370
locally protects the issuer of the capital

45
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,450
protected note, because its value changes

46
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,590
by the same amount for small changes in the S&P 500 index.

47
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,940
Here, initially, the index was at 10.

48
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,880
And the delta hedging strategy was set up,

49
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,740
so that for small stock price changes around 10,

50
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,960
the change in the replicating portfolio

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,830
would mirror the change in the value of the structured note.

52
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,780
Delta-gamma hedging requires setting

53
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,750
the first and second derivatives of our hedged portfolio

54
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,800
I to 0 with respect to the underlying stock value s.

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,650
The strategy also involves rebalancing the hedge

56
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,590
over time.

57
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,800
So differentiating the expression for I

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,010
once with respect to s, we get the delta of that portfolio,

59
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,250
which will set equal to 0.

60
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,950
And then differentiating it a second time,

61
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,150
we get the gamma or convexity of the portfolio, which we also

62
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,820
set equal to 0.

63
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,320
This gives us two linear equations and two unknowns,

64
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,150
the fraction of the stock, and the number

65
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,830
of short term call options, nc.

66
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,580
We can solve the second equation directly for nc.

67
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,510
It implies that nc is the ratio of the gamma of the option we

68
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,380
have a short position in and the gamma of the option we're

69
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,890
using to hedge the curvature.

70
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,220
This makes intuitive sense, that the larger

71
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,250
the gamma of the position being hedged relative to the option

72
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,000
we're using to hedge it, the larger the size of the hedge

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,770
position needs to be.

74
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,220
Well, once we know nc, we can solve

75
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,830
for n using first equation, and we get this expression for m.

76
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,750
Notice that the position in stocks

77
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,329
here is different than if we had only delta

78
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,730
hedged, and that's generally the case

79
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,980
when we do delta-gamma hedging.

80
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,890
In this case, the long position of the stock is smaller.

81
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,400
That's because part of the delta hedge

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,310
is being accomplished by the delta of the short term call

83
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,510
option, and in this case, that delta is positive.

84
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,780
We'll now apply this methodology to the capital protected

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,500
note example and see how much the strategy is

86
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,680
likely to improve over just delta hedging.

87
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,210
We calculated last time that the at the money short call

88
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,500
per unit of the index had a value of 1.7.

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,170
Plugging our assumptions into the BSM formulas

90
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:04,740
for the delta and gamma of this option, the gamma is 0.08,

91
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,900
and the delta is 0.5747.

92
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,350
Let's also imagine that we're going to use a one year call

93
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,950
option as part of the hedge, and let's

94
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,530
hold the other assumptions, of course, as before.

95
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:25,860
Well, we find that option we're using to hedge is worth 0.6443,

96
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,940
that it has a gamma of 0.2575, and that it

97
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,090
has a delta of 0.5512.

98
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,850
Putting this information into the equation

99
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,090
for the number of one year call options, nc,

100
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,330
we find that we need 0.3113 in that long call option position.

101
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,930
Turning to the position in the replicating portfolio

102
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,780
in the stock, we get n equals 0.4031.

103
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,420
And then, finally, we find the position

104
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,240
in bonds in the usual way, which is

105
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,360
to take the difference between the call option

106
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,500
and the value of the risky part of the hedge portfolio.

107
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,260
We find that we need a short position in bonds

108
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,620
equal to minus 2.53.

109
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,260
Just a few comments I want to add here.

110
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,270
You should loopback at last week's notes

111
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,490
and compare the replicating portfolio we just

112
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,940
derived with the one last week that employed a pure delta

113
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,720
hedge.

114
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,990
You'll see that this portfolio today involves a smaller

115
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,170
position in the stock index, because, again, the short term

116
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,840
call option contributes its positive delta

117
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,980
to the replicating portfolio.

118
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,800
Another option observation I want

119
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,920
to make that might not seem as obvious at first

120
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,570
is that you could have accomplished

121
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,650
the same delta-gamma hedge using a put option in place

122
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,080
of the short term call option and as the source

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,760
of positive convexity.

124
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,890
Note, though, that because the put option has

125
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,440
a negative delta, it would have implied

126
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,285
that the position in the stock in the replicating portfolio

127
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,910
would have actually been larger than it

128
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,940
would have been in the case of pure delta hedging.

129
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,700
In general, the choice of which option to use,

130
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,070
as we've seen for other strategies,

131
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,480
generally comes down to cost and liquidity.

132
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,700
Turning back to the diagram of the sensitivity

133
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,980
of the current value of the capital protected note

134
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,100
to the stock index value, we can compare it

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,380
to the sensitivity of the replicating portfolio

136
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,610
for a delta hedge and for a delta-gamma hedge.

137
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,070
The replicating portfolio for a delta hedge

138
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,710
as before as represented by the tangent line

139
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,420
at the current normalized index value of 10.

140
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,400
As we saw before, the delta hedge

141
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,410
tracks the price fairly well between, say,

142
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:47,400
an index value of nine and 11, so for about this region.

143
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,470
For larger stock price movements,

144
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,110
the tracking error starts to become significant.

145
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,140
The replicating portfolio for the delta-gamma hedge

146
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,690
is shown by the dotted line.

147
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,760
You can see that it more closely follows

148
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,820
the curvature of the value of the capital protected note

149
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,700
and provides pretty good protection for a significantly

150
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,460
wider range of stock price movements

151
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,180
approximately for stock prices between eight and 13.

152
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,180
This slide summarizes the key points.

153
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,180
The delta-gamma hedging strategy offers protection

154
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,630
against considerably larger swings in stock prices

155
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,640
and so allows for less frequent rebalancing.

156
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,740
In the example we just looked at,

157
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,500
it widened the region of stock prices, where the hedge was

158
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,070
effective from a range of about nine to 11

159
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,179
to a range of about eight to 13.

160
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,090
An advantage then of delta-gamma hedging

161
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,030
is that it can economize on transactions costs,

162
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,390
because it allows for less frequent portfolio rebalancing.

163
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,810
An offsetting factor, though, is that using options

164
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,420
as part of the hedge can be more expensive than just

165
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,420
trading in the stock for a delta hedging strategy.

166
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,400
The gamma hedge is also valuable,

167
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,800
because it protects better against jumps

168
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,780
in stock prices, which can cause delta hedges to fail badly.

169
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,360
A final observation is that the capital protected

170
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,320
note was marketed as a great way of achieving stock market

171
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,020
exposure, while protecting your principal.

172
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,000
In fact, the value of the capital

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,940
protected note will vary over time with the stock price

174
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,620
as the diagram shows and could easily fall below $10.

175
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,530
So while the capital protected note

176
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,520
