1
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:01,970
PROFESSOR: It would be incorrect for you

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,740
to take away from this discussion

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,530
that the Black-Scholes-Merton model is just too inaccurate

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,230
to be useful for practitioners.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,660
To the contrary, it works reasonably

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,320
well for a number of purposes, including hedging options

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,050
positions against changes in stock prices,

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,900
using delta or delta gamma hedging.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,350
It also remains the basis for widely used implied volatility

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,840
calculations and for some price quotations

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,820
and while more complicated models

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,490
may yield more accurate price predictions,

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,680
it turns out to be very valuable to have

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,200
a model like the Black-Scholes-Merton model that

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,780
can generate price approximations extremely

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,420
quickly when speed is essential.

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,970
Of course, there are times when a more accurate pricing

18
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,900
tool is valuable, such as if an investment bank wants

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,620
to price complicated option contracts that they write,

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,140
or when the possibility of early exercise

21
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,230
has a significant effect on value.

22
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,060
A number of modeling approaches have

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,850
been developed to provide more accurate options prices

24
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,980
that overcome particular shortcomings

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,170
of the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

26
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,420
Those include models where volatility

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,090
changes over time, either deterministically

28
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,950
or stochastically.

29
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,250
There's also models that incorporate price jumps.

30
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,040
The implied volatilities from these other models

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,230
or from the market prices of options

32
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,560
can be incorporated into what's called an implied tree model,

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,560
and then the tree can be used to price other options more

34
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,620
accurately.

35
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,180
All of these models were designed

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,270
to deliver results that are consistent with the idea that

37
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,510
out of the money put options are expensive because of the risk

38
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,540
premium associated with the protection against very

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,430
large negative returns.

40
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,730
We'll now go on a short tour of some of these models.

41
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,800
You won't be tested on their details,

42
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,900
beyond what appears in homework problems

43
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,660
but you should understand the main ideas and motivations

44
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,550
behind them.

45
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,130
One way to account for the patterns

46
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,290
we observe in implied volatilities

47
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,350
is to incorporate the assumption that volatility is not

48
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,009
constant, but rather, that it's a function of the stock price.

49
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,760
The constant elasticity of variance model shown here

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,210
does this by modeling the log of the growth stock return

51
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,300
as having a drift, mu times h, plus a volatility term that's

52
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,740
based on three factors.

53
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,010
The first is the current stock price

54
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,880
taken to the power of alpha.

55
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,890
The second is a constant, which scales volatility.

56
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,920
And the third is a shock drawn from

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,850
a standard normal distribution.

58
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,870
This model reduces to the Black-Scholes-Merton assumption

59
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,950
about stock returns when alpha is set equal to 0.

60
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,520
When alpha is negative, it causes return volatility

61
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,600
to increase when stock prices fall.

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,170
That implies a volatility smirk consistent with the data.

63
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,770
The reason is that if volatility is high

64
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,930
when stock prices have low moneyness,

65
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,140
that higher volatility will cause both putting call option

66
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,860
values to increase, which in turn increases the implied

67
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,540
volatility.

68
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,400
The most well-known model that incorporates

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,020
stochastic volatility is the Heston model,

70
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,690
named after its inventor.

71
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,000
This stochastic volatility model also

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,700
captures the smirk and implied volatilities.

73
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,920
In addition, it reflects the empirical fact

74
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,130
that volatility varies considerably over time.

75
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,270
The Heston model specifies a process for stock returns

76
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,090
that has a drift term that, as usual,

77
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,070
represents the expected return over the interval h.

78
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,740
It also has a volatility term based

79
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,800
on the square root of stochastic function v,

80
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,860
and a draw, epsilon 1 at each time t,

81
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,740
from a standard normal distribution.

82
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:55,440
The innovations in volatility, v of t plus h minus v of t,

83
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,530
are model as being mean reverting.

84
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,080
The mean reversion is at a rate k

85
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,770
so that, when v is below its mean reverting level

86
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,380
v upper bar, it tends to increase.

87
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,240
And when v is above its mean reverting level,

88
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,250
v tends to decrease.

89
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,980
This reflects what we saw in the data,

90
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,100
that periods of higher or lower than normal volatility

91
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,870
tend to be short lived.

92
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,470
There's also a second term in the innovations that

93
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,550
involves a second draw from a standard normal distribution,

94
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,110
epsilon 2.

95
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,630
One can prove that, when you assume

96
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,080
that the correlation between epsilon 1 and epsilon 2

97
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,030
is negative, the model will imply a volatility smirk.

98
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,000
The intuition is that, if epsilon 1 is negative

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,690
so that returns are low, then epsilon 2

100
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,530
tends to be positive because of that negative correlation.

101
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,330
That has the effect of increasing

102
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,870
the volatility of the following period when prices are low,

103
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,900
increasing the probability of further price declines,

104
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,500
and increasing the value of insurance against downturns.

105
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,780
It's fairly straightforward to introduce jumps

106
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,340
into the stock return process.

107
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,810
For example, the specification here for the stochastic stock

108
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,700
return between times t and t plus h has three terms--

109
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:27,030
mu times h, the expected return over an interval of h;

110
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,250
sigma times epsilon, a draw from a standard normal distribution

111
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,310
representing volatility during normal times;

112
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,370
and a jump term, omega times Q of t.

113
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,560
Omega parameterizes the size of the jumps.

114
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Qt is an indicator variable that is 0 most of the time

115
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,520
and equal to 1 with the probability assumed

116
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,690
for a jump occurring.

117
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,530
Omega could be a constant, or it could be modeled as,

118
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,660
itself, a random variable.

119
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,880
If it's constrained to be negative,

120
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,270
it captures the idea that most large jumps in prices

121
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,640
are in fact negative ones.

122
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,100
When it's taken to be negative, it also

123
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,220
induces an implied volatility smirk.

124
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,220
Technically, pricing with jumps involves

125
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,830
additional complications, because relying

126
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,560
on the price of a continuous replication strategy

127
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,610
is no longer possible.

128
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,570
And how to incorporate the price of jump risk

129
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,040
remains a largely unsolved problem.
