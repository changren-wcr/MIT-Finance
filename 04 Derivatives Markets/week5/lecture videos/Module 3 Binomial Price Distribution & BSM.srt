00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:03,660
PROFESSOR: To see the relationship

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,600
between the binomial model and the Black-Scholes-Merton model,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,930
it's necessary to understand the probability distribution

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,560
of stock prices at the terminal time, cap T, implied

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,280
by the binomial model.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,350
Clearly, for some of the nodes there

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,260
are many different paths through the tree that land there.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,050
And for others, there are few, or even just one way,

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,400
to get there.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,710
There are n + 1 nodes at maturity

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,100
on an n-step tree, indexed by j equals 0 through n.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,790
The top node can be reached only along the path

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,640
where there are n ups, and no downs.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:50,720
So if n were equal to 3, we would have n up, up, up

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,450
and that would be the only way to keep

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,590
on going up in the tree.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,230


18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,800
The next node down can be reached in several ways.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,490
It can be reached with any path with two ups and one down.

20
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:19,330
So we could go down, up, up, or we could go up, down, up,

21
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,290
or we could go up, up, down, and get to this node.

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,600
Continuing in this way, the bottom node

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,750
can only be reached, again, in one way, with three downs:

24
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,110
down, down, down.

25
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,770


26
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,040
The mathematical formula that summarizes that information

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,860
on the risk-neutral probability of reaching each node j,

28
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,625
at time cap T, is given by the formula that we have here.

29
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:53,100


30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,360
The inputs are the risk-neutral probability of an up,

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,800
q* and the number of nodes on the tree.

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,120
The exclamation points stand for factorials,

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,669
which are the product of a sequence of increasing

34
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,690
integers.

35
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,570
For example, 3 factorial is 1 times 2 times 3.

36
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,580
By convention, 0 factorial equals 1.

37
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,740
Some of you may recognize this formula

38
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,245
as arising directly from the binomial theorem.

39
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:30,380


40
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,890
The trees down here has the complete set of stock price

41
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,730
outcomes and the associated probabilities at the final time

42
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,160
on a three-step tree.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,020
It also shows the formulas, in this case,

44
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,930
that generate the probabilities at the top two nodes.

45
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,900
As a number of steps gets large, one

46
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,110
can prove that the distribution of stock price outcomes

47
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,270
converges to a log-normal distribution.

48
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,150
This graph plots the probability distribution

49
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,330
for the stock price on a tree with 250 steps,

50
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,610
T equals 1, and an initial stock price of 100.

51
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,360
The possible stock price outcomes are on the x-axis,

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,670
and the probabilities of those different outcomes

53
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,420
are on the y-axis.

54
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,110


55
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,820
If we take the log of each of those 250 price observations

56
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,720
and plot the outcomes against the probability of each,

57
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,900
we get the figure shown here.

58
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,180
It's possible to prove mathematically

59
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,920
that in the limit as n goes to infinity,

60
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,220
this is the normal density function,

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,120
with mean and standard deviations at time cap T,

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,100
given by these equations.

63
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:53,130
We have the mean, and we have the standard deviation.

64
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,400
You can see that the results from the binomial tree

65
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,830
are indistinguishable, with 250 steps, from those calculated

66
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,395
using the formula for the normal density directly.

67
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:09,290


68
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,260
What we can conclude from this graphical analysis

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,210
is that the probability distribution

70
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,910
of the log of the stock price at time cap T,

71
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,700
implied by the binomial tree, is the same

72
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,480
as the normal distribution.

73
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,540
We also know that we can price a call option in the usual

74
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,070
risk-neutral way, which is actually equivalent to finding

75
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,640
the risk-neutral probability of each terminal node --

76
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,320
which we'll call capital Q* --

77
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,280
using that probability weight for the payoff on that node,

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,615
and discounting it back to time 0 at the risk-free rate.

79
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:50,210


80
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,240
I want to turn back to the fact that, in the limit,

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,700
S sub T is log-normally distributed.

82
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,840
We'll call f of S sub T the log-normal distribution of T,

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:12,180
with mean mu of T, and standard deviation, sigma of T.

84
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,410
In the limit, the formula for the value of the call option,

85
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,260
based on the summation in the first equation here,

86
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,610
converges to the integral we've written down here.

87
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,670


88
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,300
It turns out that the bottom integral is mathematically

89
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,910
equivalent to the Black-Scholes-Merton formula

90
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,690
for pricing a European call option.

91
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,510
Therefore, we've informally shown that the binomial tree

92
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,450
model converges to the Black-Scholes-Merton model

93
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,610
as the number of steps on the tree goes to infinity.

94
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,000
