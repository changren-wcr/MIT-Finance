1
00:00:01,783 --> 00:00:04,200
PROFESSOR: We'll continue to use the general procedure you

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,620
learned last week to price derivatives on a binomial tree,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,080
but now we can write the risk neutral probability

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,510
of an up move q star in terms of u, d, r, and h.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,340
In fact, it's straightforward to prove

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,460
that q star will equal the ratio shown here

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,020
on a non-dividend-paying stock.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,050
You can verify that it comes from solving for q star

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,050
as we did last week based on the equation that

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,350
sets the current stock price equal to the discounted

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,990
value of the risk neutral expectation of the stock

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,020
price on the next time step discounted back

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,750
at the risk-free rate.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,330
Well, once we have the price tree and q star,

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,170
we can price any European style derivative as before

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,830
by evaluating the payoff at the terminal time t

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,440
and working backwards.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,250
Then at each time step and on each node,

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,820
we can calculate the risk neutral expectation

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,640
of the derivative value on the next step

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,140
and discount it back to get the value of the derivative

22
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,490
at the node we're looking at.

23
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,390


24
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,000
For instance, for call options, we

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,510
start at the n-th time step, which is the last one,

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,170
and compute the payoff at each of the j nodes

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,975
from the familiar equation for the payoff on a call.

28
00:01:27,975 --> 00:01:31,310


29
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,940
We then can work backwards to find the call value at time i

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,910
and know j calculating the risk neutral

31
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,680
expected value at time i plus 1 based on the risk

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,490
neutral probability and discounting back

33
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:52,030
over the time interval h at the risk-free rate.

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,570
Going back to the inputs in the binomial tree spreadsheet,

35
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,810
we can specify the strike price of the option.

36
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,180
In this example, we'll assume the strike

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,540
price is set equal to 100.

38
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,130
There's also an indicator variable,

39
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,699
which we set to 1 to indicate that we're

40
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,410
looking for a call price.

41
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,150
If that's sent to any other value,

42
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,435
the spreadsheet will treat the option as a put option.

43
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:19,200


44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,710
We need to set the time horizon capital

45
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,490
T to be the expiration date of the option, which

46
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,545
we'll take to be 0.1% here.

47
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:31,210


48
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,770
The output then also includes the risk neutral probability q

49
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,060
star, the same as the stock price

50
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,210
tree we saw before based on an n of 10 steps between time 0

51
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,440
and time capped t of 0.1.

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,600
Then the value of the option at each node

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,990
is represented on the lower tree and calculated

54
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,970
by working backwards.

55
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,690
For example, at the time 0.1 node,

56
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,350
where the stock price is $112.75,

57
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,950
the payoff on the call option is $12.75.

58
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:19,250
The time 0 node gives the call option value of 3.787.

59
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,430
That value is also recorded at the top

60
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,070
of the spreadsheet, along with the delta of the call option,

61
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,891
[AUDIO OUT].

62
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:31,540


63
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,090
The calculations here are based on the same input,

64
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,400
except for the number of steps on the trees

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,120
has been increased from 10 to 250.

66
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,300
Clearly, there's too many numbers in a 250-step tree

67
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,960
to show on a single slide.

68
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,530
So what's pictured here is a truncation

69
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,410
showing only the first 10 steps for the stock price tree

70
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,100
and also for the call price tree.

71
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,740
Notice that with the change in the number of steps

72
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,920
and all else the same as before, the output parameters u, d, q,

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,510
and q star all have to change too.

74
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,470
Those changes capture the lower stock price variation

75
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,890
and smaller effective discounting over each shorter

76
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,550
time interval between nodes.

77
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:27,450
The estimated call price now is 3.876.

78
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,940
That's quite close to the previous and less

79
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,530
precisely estimated price of 3.787, which was

80
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,200
based on only using 10 steps.

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,080
As we're about to discuss, the limit

82
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,120
taking the number of steps to infinity

83
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,350
gives the Black-Scholes-Merton price, which is 3.88.

84
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,320
With 250 steps, we get essentially the same answer.
