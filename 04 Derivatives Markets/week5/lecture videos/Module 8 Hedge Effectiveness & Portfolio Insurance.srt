1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,550
PROFESSOR: How good is the protection provided

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,960
by a delta hedging strategy?

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,130
Well, the answer will depend on a number of factors that

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,090
include the frequency of rebalancing,

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,720
the stability of the parameters, and, particularly,

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,810
the accuracy of the volatility estimate,

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,440
and whether or not there's large jumps in stock prices.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,110
Theoretically, rebalancing would occur

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,500
continuously but that would be prohibitively

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,620
expensive to execute and, in practice,

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,350
there's always a trade off between how often the hedge is

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,070
adjusted and the cost of making those adjustments.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,620
A practical answer, though, to the question,

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,520
is that such strategies work well enough

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,850
to make it profitable for many financial institutions

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,580
to offer products like capital protected notes

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,530
to their clients.

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,500
For an example of where dynamic delta hedging worked well

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,430
in practice, here we're looking at the year 2000

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,310
and comparing the value of a replicating portfolio

21
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,030
for a put option on the S&P 500 with the Black-Scholes-Merton

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,110
price for the same put option.

23
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,180
The top panel shows the evolution

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,620
of stock prices over that year, which fluctuated considerably,

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,490
and towards the end of the year, were mostly falling.

26
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,460
The middle panel shows how the corresponding delta

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,680
for the put option changed.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,610
As we know, the delta is always negative

29
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,550
and as the stock price falls, the put

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,680
moves further into the money, which

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,050
increases the size of the short position on the stock index.

32
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,260
The bottom panel plots the Black-Scholes-Merton price

33
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,600
for the put option and also the value

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,970
of the replicating portfolio.

35
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,620
As we'd expect, those values rise as stock prices

36
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,800
fall and vice versa.

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,600
The fact, though, that the two lines track each other

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,550
so closely means that the replicating portfolio strategy

39
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,080
is providing an effective hedge, even though rebalancing is not

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,460
occurring continuously.

41
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,400
To see why delta hedging doesn't always work,

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,580
we'll look at portfolio insurance and its track record

43
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,080
during the time of the 1987 stock market crash.

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,600
Portfolio insurance has some similarities

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,020
to the capital protected notes we've just been discussing.

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,290
Creating portfolio insurance by using dynamic trading

47
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,590
strategies is an idea created and marketed

48
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,100
by Berkeley professors, Hayne Leland and Mark Rubinstein

49
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,350
and their friend, John O'Brien.

50
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,380
Their work created a still popular but sometimes

51
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,800
controversial way to achieve protection against losses

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,030
in the stock market, while still retaining some of the upside.

53
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,640
The strategy became very controversial,

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,450
because it was initially blamed for causing, or at least making

55
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,330
worse, the 1987 stock market crash.

56
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,050
However, investigations into that allegation

57
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,440
concluded that these strategies were probably not to blame.

58
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,780
Various forms of portfolio insurance

59
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,850
were developed around that time.

60
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,480
And they could be implemented in a variety of ways.

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,770
One was with the sale of out-of-the-money put options

62
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,200
that limited investor losses on the market.

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,290
The willingness by investors, using the strategy

64
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,690
to take some losses, is like taking

65
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,600
a deductible and an insurance policy that

66
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,970
lowers its premium cost.

67
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,940
The most significant development in this period

68
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,590
was that of perpetual insurance, which appealed to long horizon

69
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,560
investors like pension funds that

70
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,860
got only limited value out of protection that

71
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,570
just lasts a few years.

72
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,140
Perpetual insurance is like having a renewable American put

73
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,780
option that never expires.

74
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,200
That insurance allows the investor or the insured

75
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,160
to exercise its option at any time in the future.

76
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,340
Portfolio insurance seemed to be working very well,

77
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,230
but then came the October 1987 stock market crash.

78
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,410
To see how and why portfolio insurance failed

79
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,200
during the 1987 market crash, we'll

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,920
again compare the value of a put option on the S&P 500

81
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,950
with a replicating portfolio for that same option

82
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,120
over the same period.

83
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,190
The top panel shows the evolution of stock prices,

84
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,180
now for the year 1987.

85
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,860
The market was generally rising until the crash on October 19,

86
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,750
when it fell precipitously by 23% in one day,

87
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,090
and remained at that lower level for most

88
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,410
of the rest of the year.

89
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,830
The middle panel shows that with the rising market earlier

90
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,480
in the year, the Delta of a put option that's originally

91
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,110
at the money rises toward 0 over time,

92
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,160
as the put option goes further and further out-of-the-money.

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,000
With the market crash, there's a huge downward jump in Delta,

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,020
meaning that a substantial short position is required

95
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,570
in the replicating portfolio.

96
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,450
Turning to the bottom panel, it's

97
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,110
comparing the evolution of the Black-Scholes-Merton put value

98
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,870
with that of the replicating portfolio over time.

99
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,250
You can see that the two track well earlier in the year

100
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,860
when stock prices moved smoothly over time.

101
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,470
But at the time of the crash, the two values diverged.

102
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,760
The replicating portfolio value fell relative

103
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,400
to the Black-Scholes-Merton put value.

104
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,440
You can think of what happened in terms of the short position

105
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,100
in the replicating portfolio becoming

106
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,280
too small at the time of the crash, and hence,

107
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,820
benefiting too little from the drop in stock prices.

108
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,880
That drop in the value of the replicating portfolio

109
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,940
meant that portfolio insurance strategies

110
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,400
failed to protect investors against losses

111
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,950
in the face of the crash in stock prices

112
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,000
exactly the time when the insurance was most needed.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,400
This real world episode illustrates

114
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,950
in practice what we learned in theory,

115
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,380
delta hedging strategies only work

116
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,890
well when stock price movements are pretty smooth

117
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,500
and when there's no large jumps.

118
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,020
When there are large jumps in stock prices,

119
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,630
it's impossible to rebalance fast enough

120
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,290
to eliminate all the risk.

121
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,590
Next week, we'll start by seeing how to modify the hedging

122
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,640
strategy by incorporating Delta Gamma hedging, which

123
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,130
leads to a more robust hedge.

124
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,650
We'll also look more closely at modeling volatility

125
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,240
and at some of the other popular options pricing models.

126
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,330
See you then.
