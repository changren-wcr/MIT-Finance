00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
PROFESSOR: Theta is a sensitivity of an option's

1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,230
value to the passage of time.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,160
It's estimated by taking the derivative of an options price

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,650
with respect to the current time, little t.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,430


5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,340
Note that as the current time increases,

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,260
the remaining time to expiration decreases.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,430
Thus, Theta is telling us about what happens to option value

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,220
as its remaining maturity gets smaller.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,010
The expression for Theta that comes out

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,690
of the Black-Scholes-Merton model

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,340
is a long and ugly formula, and I won't ask you to use it.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,160
But I do want you to understand the forces that

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,860
influence its value.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,130
In fact, the sign of Theta can be either positive or negative,

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,570
depending on where the current stock price is, relative

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,220
to the strike price, and also depending on other parameters.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,190
To understand why the sign can go either way,

18
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,310
consider the current value of a put option

19
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,780
as a function of the current stock price,

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:14,010
and also the payoff on that same option at its expiration.

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,830
The current value of the put is in blue, as usual.

22
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,915
And now, the payoff is this dotted line.

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,510


24
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,950
We know by no arbitrage that, as the expiration date approaches,

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,380
the current value of the option has

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,210
to approach its final payoff.

27
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,090
Because the characteristic shape of the current value

28
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,580
of a European put option typically

29
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,050
lies below the final payoff for low values of the stock price,

30
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,740
and it lies above the final payoff for high values

31
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,900
of the stock price, we have a positive Theta for low stock

32
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:02,240
prices and we have a negative Theta for high stock prices.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,990


34
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,880
This slide, again, explains the idea

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,360
of the Theta of a European put option

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,990
is positive for low stock prices and negative for high stock

37
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,980
prices.

38
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,310
The basic story is what I just explained.

39
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,140
In thinking about Theta in general,

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,520
you should keep in mind that, for both puts and calls,

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,740
a shorter time to expiration tends

42
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,730
to reduce option value because it shortens the time over which

43
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,130
the option provides insurance value

44
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,620
or that it has positive upside.

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,590
This is related to the fact that an option typically

46
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,040
has positive time value.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,170
However, that's not always the case.

48
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,800
A simple example demonstrates that the opposite

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,660
can be true for a put option.

50
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,000
That is, that it can become more valuable when there's

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,330
a shorter time to expiration, and thus have a positive Theta.

52
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,350
Say the stock value has gone to 0 because the firm has

53
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,230
gone bankrupt.

54
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,840
Then, the payoff will just be the strike price

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,100
and the value of that payoff today is its present value.

56
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,380
The present value will be higher, the sooner

57
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,160
the payoff can be realized.

58
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,250
For European call options, there's two distinct cases

59
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,450
to consider.

60
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,130
When the stock won't pay a dividend

61
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:27,310
prior to its expiration, Theta is unambiguously negative.

62
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,790
That's because, when the stock price is very high relative

63
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,860
to the strike price, the option is very likely to be exercised.

64
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,960
The dominant effect is it's better

65
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,480
to postpone paying the strike price,

66
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,000
because, effectively, you have a zero interest rate

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,880
loan in the amount of the strike price.

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,520
When the stock price is low, the option

69
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,130
provides downside protection for longer, if it

70
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,570
has a longer time to maturity.

71
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,720
And again, there's the benefit of postponing

72
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,800
any future payment.

73
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,390
The second case is for a dividend paying stock.

74
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,030
As we talked about in the last class,

75
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,120
because the dividend causes the stock price to drop,

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,910
it can be optimal to early exercise a call option

77
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,860
to capture that dividend.

78
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,830
Since that isn't possible with European options,

79
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,980
the option may be worth more on a dividend paying stock

80
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,010
when it has a shorter maturity.

81
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,100
The intuition for the sign of Theta for European call

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,290
options in each of those two cases

83
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,390
is illustrated here, graphically.

84
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,450
Again, comparing the current value of the option

85
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,990
as a function of the current stock price with its payoff

86
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,140
value at expiration.

87
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,390
The top graph shows that the value

88
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,990
of a call option on a non-dividend paying stock

89
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,520
always lies above the payoff and so converges to the payoff

90
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,220
from above over time.

91
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,670
The option is worth more alive than dead.

92
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,130
That implies a negative Theta.

93
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,110
For a dividend paying stock, which

94
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,630
is shown in the bottom graph, there

95
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,650
are two offsetting forces.

96
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,230
That is, the time value of the option

97
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,770
pulls in the opposite direction from the effect of the dividend

98
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,910
payment.

99
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,670
For low stock prices, the dividend effect

100
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,595
can dominate, resulting in a negative Theta.

101
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:22,220
Although the Black-Scholes-Merton model

102
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,580
assumes a constant interest rate and a constant stock price

103
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,670
volatility, we know, in fact, that interest rates

104
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,550
and volatilities vary over time.

105
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,580
It's useful, then, to know how much an option value will

106
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,810
be affected, in case one wants to hedge those sources of risk.

107
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,090
We'll first consider the effect of interest rate changes.

108
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,140
Rho answers the question, what's the derivative of the option

109
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,380
price, with respect to a small change in the interest

110
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,130
rate, holding everything else constant?

111
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,080
For European puts and calls, it can

112
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,020
be valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

113
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,230
That implies the simple formulas for Rho that are shown here.

114
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,970


115
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,260
The sign of Rho for a call option is always positive.

116
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,830
That's because, when interest rates are higher,

117
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,830
the value of waiting to pay the strike price, K,

118
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,290
is also higher.

119
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,660
The opposite is true for a put option.

120
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,640
And its Rho is always negative.

121
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,490
Having to wait to receive the strike price

122
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,280
becomes more costly with a higher interest rate.

123
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,140
The formulas for Rho show that it increases at absolute value

124
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,970
with the expiration date, cap T. That makes sense,

125
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,040
because the longer the time to expiration,

126
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,910
the larger is the effect of interest rates on value.

127
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,260
It also increases with K for the same reason.

128
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:01,430
Finally, Rho is affected by N of d2 and N of minus d2.

129
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,090


130
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,360
The weights of N of d2 an N of minus d2

131
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,210
can always be interpreted as the probability

132
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,900
that the option will expire in the money, which, of course, is

133
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,360
when the timing of the strike price payment

134
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,880
will be relevant to value.

135
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,590
Our final Greek is Vega.

136
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,990
Vega measures the sensitivity of option value to volatility.

137
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,550
As usual, we differentiate the option value with respect

138
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,640
to the variable of interest, in this case, Sigma.

139
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,210


140
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,020
Vega turns out to be always positive.

141
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,770
And in the case of the Black-Scholes-Merton version,

142
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,470
it's equal to this expression.

143
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,190
Both put and call options provide more protection

144
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,210
and more potential upside when volatility increases.

145
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,660
And that increases their value.

146
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,860
As this graph shows, Vega is highest for an at the money

147
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,320
option, where the curvature of the payoff

148
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,530
and the current value of the option is highest.

149
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,220
A curiosity about Vega that you might have already noticed

150
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,130
is that it's not actually a Greek letter.

151
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,860
But for the purposes of options pricing,

152
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,500
it's become an honorary Greek.

153
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,000
