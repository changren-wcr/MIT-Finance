PROFESSOR: This week, you'll learn

1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,440
to use the famous Black-Scholes Merton formula for options

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,400
pricing and to understand the main drivers of option price

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,880
sensitivity, which are known as the Greeks.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,610
We'll start, again, with a binomial model

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,980
and learn how it's typically calibrated

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,410
to match stock price dynamics.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,380
By taking the limit as the number of steps

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,430
goes to infinity and the step size goes to 0,

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,770
you'll see one way that the Black-Scholes Merton

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,630
formula for pricing European stock options can be derived.

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,300
Next, we'll take a close look at the Black-Scholes Merton

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,420
model, the formula, and its inputs,

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,080
and the assumptions and intuition behind the model.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,420
Then we'll turn to the Greeks, which

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,010
are measures of an option value's

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,730
sensitivity to key parameters, including the underlying stock

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,770
price, the risk-free rate, time to expiration, and volatility.

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,000
Finally, we'll study a financial engineering application,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,210
which is how an insurer can use a dynamic delta hedging

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,320
strategy to limit its exposure to losses from the portfolio

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,300
protection products it sells.

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,060
We'll see that the strategy often works well,

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,220
but that it can fail dramatically when there

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,460
are large and sudden price changes, such as those that

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,360
occur during financial panics.
