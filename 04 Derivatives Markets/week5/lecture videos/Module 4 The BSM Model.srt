00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,250
PROFESSOR: A rigorous derivation of the basic Black-Scholes

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,290
model relies on the assumptions listed here.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,430
First, financial markets are frictionless.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,560
That means no taxes on trading or transactions costs,

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,110
that assets are perfectly divisible,

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,610
and there are no restrictions on short sales.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,430
Second, interest rates for risk-free borrowing and lending

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,000
are equal and constant.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,680


10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,320
Third, the stock pays no dividends

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,540
over the life of the option.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,320
Note that this assumption is quite easily relaxed.

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,460
And fourth, stock prices conform to the log-normal model.

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,100
That model assumes that stock prices follow

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,340
a continuous path, importantly with no jumps,

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,040
and that the mean and variance of the log return are constant.

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,180
Furthermore, the log return over any period of time

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,780
is independent of the log return over any other period of time

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,070
and that log return is normally distributed.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,280
Knowing these assumptions is important not just

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,080
to understand the theory.

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,540
It's important for the practical reason

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,450
that when the assumptions don't hold, such as when

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,460
short selling the asset or borrowing

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,940
is expensive or impossible, using the formula

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,090
to evaluate options prices may lead you

27
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,450
to an inaccurate conclusion about the value.

28
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,930
In such cases, the model has to be modified

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,835
or a different model has to be used.

30
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:40,870


31
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,620
In their original analyses, Black and Scholes and,

32
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,770
separately, Merton showed that under these assumptions,

33
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,690
the return on the stock option could

34
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,620
be replicated with a portfolio consisting of precisely chosen

35
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,190
quantities of the underlying stock and a risk-free bond.

36
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,500
To find the call option price, they

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,990
used the same sort of argument that we went through

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,880
in the binomial case.

39
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,530
Namely that if two portfolios have exactly the same payoffs

40
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,510
in every future state of the world,

41
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,810
they must have the same value today.

42
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,840
For a European call option, they show

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,300
that the replicating portfolio always

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,200
involves a long position or a positive fraction

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,260
of the underlying stock and a short position

46
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,320
in the risk-free bond.

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,500
The fraction of stock in the replicating portfolio

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,840
is set at each point in time so that it

49
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,570
equals the partial derivative of the call option

50
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,340
value with respect to the stock price, the delta

51
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,720
in this equation here.

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,170


53
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,090
Since that sensitivity --

54
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,630
delta -- is constantly changing with remaining maturity

55
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,570
of the option and with the price of the stock,

56
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,520
the number of shares of stock in the replicating portfolio has

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,330
to be constantly adjusted as well.

58
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,520
Similarly for a put option, the hedge ratio or delta

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,010
for the put is the sensitivity of the put value to changes

60
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,580
in the underlying stock price.

61
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,500
As this relation is negative, it implies a short position

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,890
in stocks in the replicating portfolio.

63
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,990
An interesting historical note is

64
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,600
that even though the publication of Bob Merton's version

65
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,990
of the result was in 1974, a year

66
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,260
after that of Black and Scholes, Merton actually

67
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,480
finished his proof first.

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,780
The gentleman that he is, he kindly waited for his friends

69
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,750
Fischer Black and Myron Scholes to finish their version

70
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,910
before submitting his result to a journal.

71
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,880
It's helpful to see graphically the idea of using delta

72
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,430
to construct a replicating portfolio.

73
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,320
Here, the situation is illustrated

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,650
for a put option when the current stock price is at 100,

75
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,950
and the strike price is fixed at 100.

76
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,610
The x-axis is the underlying stock price,

77
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,440
and the y-axis is the value of the put option, which

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,769
is shown by the blue curve, or the value

79
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,190
of the replicating portfolio, which is

80
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,860
going to be this tangent line.

81
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,970
Notice that the current value of the put option

82
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,690
has a shape that's quite similar to the payoff at expiration

83
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,000
of the put option, but the relationship

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,010
is a smooth curve rather than a kinked line.

85
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,370
That's because prior to expiration,

86
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,670
there's no sharp difference between the value on each side

87
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,960
of the strike price.

88
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,400
If the put option is slightly out of the money,

89
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,470
it could end up in the money and vice versa.

90
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,550
Now the replicating portfolio is structured

91
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,120
to have the same sensitivity to changes in the stock prices

92
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,940
as does the put option.

93
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,375
That means choosing a delta or share

94
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:11,080
of stocks based on the slope of the put option value curve

95
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,090
at the current stock price, which

96
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,170
is given by this tangent line.

97
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,080
So we're looking at the current stock price,

98
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,310
and we want a portfolio with the same sensitivity

99
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,960
locally to changes in the stock price as what

100
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,490
we have with the put option.

101
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,242
You can see here that for small changes in the stock price,

102
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:39,950
the value of the put option and the value

103
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,120
of the replicating portfolio will, in fact, move together.

104
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:51,940
But for larger changes in price, the two will start to diverge.

105
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,320


106
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,280
This should remind you of the analysis we did earlier

107
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,080
when we were discussing delta gamma

108
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,890
hedging for a bond or fixed income derivative product.

109
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,370
The principle -- the delta comes from the slope of a tangent

110
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,210
line --

111
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,260
is exactly the same in both analyses.

112
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,800
There's one difference that you should keep in mind though.

113
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,290
With stock options, the x-axis is the underlying stock price.

114
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,410
In our earlier analysis of fixed-income derivatives,

115
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,410
the x-axis was the level of interest rates

116
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,840
rather than of bond prices.

117
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,810
We'll see later in the class why this difference arises.

118
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,710
But I want to emphasize here that the basic logic

119
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,930
of both analysis is identical.

120
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,800


121
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,610
There are five inputs into the original Black-Scholes-Merton

122
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:51,810
formula: the current stock price, the exercise price,

123
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,540
the remaining time to expiration,

124
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,770
the risk-free rate, and the annualized standard deviation

125
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,410
of log stock returns.

126
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,320
The most commonly used version of the formula

127
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,390
also incorporates the possibility

128
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,760
of a constant dividend yield, which

129
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,590
is often noted as little delta.

130
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,030
So here, we finally have it: the Black-Scholes-Merton options

131
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,440
pricing model.

134
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:36,180


135
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,120
This equation says that the value of a European call

136
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,030
option, given the five inputs, is the stock price multiplied

137
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,590
by N of d1 minus the present value of the strike

138
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,900
price multiplied by N of d2.

139
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,630
N represents the cumulative density function

140
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,760
of a standard normal random variable.

141
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,920
The inputs d1 and d2 are both functions

142
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,600
of our five basic inputs.

143
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,990
The value of the corresponding put option

144
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,400
is given by this equation.

145
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
It's found using Put-Call Parity.

146
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,900
As with the binomial model, the actual expected return

147
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,230
on the stock doesn't enter into our pricing formula.

148
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,060
It's reflected indirectly, though,

149
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,710
through the current stock price.

150
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,010
Now to implement these pricing formulas,

151
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,280
there's a spreadsheet available with the course materials

152
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,700
called BSMandBlacksmodel.xls.

153
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,940
You can use it for the homework and for the exam.

154
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,309
It uses a built-in function to solve

155
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:47,000
for the values of the cumulative standard normal distribution.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,070


157
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,320
The example here shows that using the model

158
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,860
is quite straightforward once you've identified the inputs.

159
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,740
The calculation is for an at-the-money option

160
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,730
with a current stock price and strike price of 100.

161
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,350
The interest rate is 5%, and the maturity is one year.

162
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,200
The return volatility on a continuous annual basis

163
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,220
is 30%, which is quite typical for stocks in the United

164
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,110
States.

165
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,950
Plugging in those values, you can calculate d1 or d2,

166
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,560
or your spreadsheet can do it for you.

167
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,760
Then you can calculate the values N of d1 and N of d2

168
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,240
using the formula for the cumulative normal distribution

169
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,590
or, again, using the spreadsheet that's programmed in Excel.

170
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:40,880
The implied value of the call option is 14.2312.

171
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,160
To find the value of a put option,

172
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,710
you need to N of negative d1 and N of negative d2.

173
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,140
You could solve for those directly.

174
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,020
But since we've already found the values of N of d1

175
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,890
and N of d2, it's simpler to just remember

176
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:04,190
that N of minus d1 is equal to 1 minus N of d1

177
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,240
and similarly for d2.

178
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,160
Plugging these inputs into the formula

179
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,470
for the value of a put option, you

180
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:18,800
can verify that it's worth 9.3542.

181
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,070
It's not difficult to extend the Black-Scholes-Merton logic

182
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,070
to the situation where the stock pays a known dividend

183
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,920
or has a known dividend yield.

184
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
In the case of a known dividend payment expected

185
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,140
to arrive before the option expiration date,

186
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,560
the original formula used to price puts and calls

187
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,110
can be used with just an adjustment

188
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,810
to the original stock price.

189
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,810
Specifically, the stock price is adjusted down

190
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,220
by the present value of the dividends paid.

191
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,130
That pulls the future distribution of stock prices

192
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,090
down, realistically reflecting that when a dividend is paid,

193
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,430
the value of future cash flows drops

194
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,690
by the amount of the dividend.

195
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,960


196
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,610
Now the case of a constant dividend yield

197
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,410
is more realistic for stock indices.

198
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,870
There, too, the future appreciation

199
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,060
of the value of the index is reduced

200
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,890
by the dividends that are paid.

201
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,850
The adjustments shown here have the same effect

202
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,640
of lowering the entire distribution of future stock

203
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,280
prices, consistent with the dividends

204
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,235
pulling down the remaining value of the underlying stocks.

205
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:35,730


206
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,910
I want to provide some further interpretation of the BSM model

207
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,650
that will be useful a little while later

208
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,280
when we're discussing dynamic delta hedging strategies.

209
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,820
The fundamental idea behind BSM is that the value of the option

210
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,030
is the same as that of the replicating portfolio of stocks

211
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,780
and bonds.

212
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,070
N of d1 is the fraction of a share of stock

213
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,880
we would hold in the replicating portfolio for a call option.

214
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,940
It equates the sensitivity of the replicating portfolio

215
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:09,050
value to stock price changes with those of the option.

216
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,450
It's conceptually equivalent to the Delta

217
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,270
we solved for when we found the replicating portfolio

218
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,620
in a binomial model.

219
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,150
The general concept is the same in both cases.

220
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,360
Delta always represents the first-order sensitivity

221
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,850
of the value of an option to the change

222
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,800
in the value of the underlying-- in this case, a stock.

223
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,500
The Delta, then, of a call option

224
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,200
is the partial derivative of the value of the call

225
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,720
option with respect to the underlying stock price

226
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,300
and so in the BSM model, this is given by N of d1.

227
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,710


228
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,460
N of d1 is always positive because this

229
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,770
is a cumulative distribution, which

230
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,690
always lies between 0 and 1.

231
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,630


232
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,620
The Delta of a put option is also a partial derivative

233
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,030
of the value of the option with respect to the underlying stock

234
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,310
and in the Black-Scholes-Merton model,

235
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,750
it's given by minus N of minus d1.

236
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,300
This is always less than 0 because we

237
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,300
have a minus sign multiplying a positive function.

238
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,670
There's also an analog between BSM

239
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,130
and the binomial model for the amount of borrowing

240
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,150
in the replicating portfolio.

241
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,840
Borrowing is given in the BSM model for a call option

242
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,270
by the term here, the strike price discounted and multiplied

243
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,900
by N of d2.

244
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,150


245
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,620
The value of the call option then

246
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,850
equals the value of the replicating portfolio,

247
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,390
delta times S minus the amount of borrowing, which

248
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,380
is represented in the Black-Scholes-Merton formula

249
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,180
by N of d1 times S for Delta times S,

250
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,380
and the discounted value of the strike price times N of d2

251
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,210
represents the amount of borrowing.

252
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,820
Finally, I want to say a few words about the different ways

253
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,950
to derive the Black-Scholes-Merton model

254
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,520
and a fun story about how it first became so famous.

255
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,550
We looked at one of the ways that the BSM formula

256
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,880
can be derived, which is as the limit of the binomial model.

257
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,940
It can also be found in two other related ways.

258
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,380
One is by solving a partial differential equation that

259
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,860
comes out of the replicating portfolio approach directly

260
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,470
and the condition of no arbitrage.

261
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,440
The other is using risk-neutral pricing.

262
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,750
All, of course, give the same result

263
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,510
and are useful for developing intuition about the model.

264
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,470
You can find these derivations in Hull or online.

265
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,900
But in the interest of time, we won't go into them here.

266
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,540
A natural question you might have at this point

267
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,930
is whether BSM really works, given all the assumptions

268
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,060
that are required.

269
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,860
The answer is that it works pretty well

270
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,910
in many circumstances and it is the most common model

271
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,450
used in hedging strategies.

272
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,980


273
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,760
A great story that speaks to the value of the model is this --

274
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,060
before Black, Scholes, and Merton derived the model,

275
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,270
stock options were being actively traded on the Chicago

276
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,580
Board Options Exchange.

277
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,390
Black and Scholes decided to try out their theory there

278
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,780
and started trading based on it.

279
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,170
If they found a stock option price that was too low based

280
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,930
on the model, they bought the option,

281
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,090
and they hedged the position by shorting

282
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,930
the replicating portfolio, and vise versa of the option price

283
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,080
was too high.

284
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,010
Apparently, the other traders initially just ignored them,

285
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,170
figuring they would lose a lot of money

286
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,130
and then retreat to their comfortable university jobs.

287
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,980
But it soon became very clear that Black and Scholes

288
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,920
were making a lot of money trading on their model.

289
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,260
Soon, other traders followed.

290
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,020
And pricing and options markets was forever

291
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,540
altered by the knowledge that options

292
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,420
could be priced scientifically using no arbitrage logic.

293
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,002
