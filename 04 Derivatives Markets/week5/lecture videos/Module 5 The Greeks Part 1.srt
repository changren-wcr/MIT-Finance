00:00:01,824 --> 00:00:04,440
PROFESSOR: Risk managers and options traders

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,440
need to know the sensitivity of the value of their option

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,070
holdings to various factors in order to understand their risk

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,620
exposure and how to hedge it.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,430
Those sensitivities of option prices are known as the Greeks.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,750
Will discuss, first, Delta, the first order sensitivity

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,470
to the underlying asset's price; second, Gamma,

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,950
the second order sensitivity to the underlying asset's price;

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,850
third, Theta, the sensitivity to the passage of time;

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,500
fourth, Rho, the sensitivity to interest rates; and fifth,

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,060
Vega, the sensitivity to the underlying's volatility.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,450
For options that can be priced using Black-Scholes-Merton,

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,270
the Greeks often can be explicitly calculated

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,010
by taking derivatives of those pricing formulas.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,400
However, the concepts are very general,

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,640
and they're frequently applied to all sorts of derivatives

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,840
that can't be priced with Black-Scholes-Merton.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,959
Delta and Gamma are the first and second order sensitivities

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,020
of an option's value to changes in the price of the underlying

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,340
asset.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,350
The general idea for the Delta is

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,800
expressed by taking the derivative of the option price

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,920
with respect to the value of the underlying.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,980
As it's represented here, the underlying

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,560
is a stock with price, S, if it's a European put or call

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,290
option that one can differentiate

27
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,880
the Black-Scholes-Merton formula,

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,250
with respect to the stock price, and prove that the Delta is

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,990
N of d1 for a call, and it's minus N of minus d1 for a put.

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,160
The Gamma of an option is found by taking the second derivative

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,600
of its value with respect to the underlying asset price.

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,960
That's equivalent to taking the first derivative of the Delta.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,820


34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,700
Again, if it's a stock option that

35
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,440
satisfies the Black-Scholes-Merton

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,550
assumptions, you can drive a closed form solution.

37
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,510
The result will be identical for either a call or put option,

38
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,650
and that's given here.

39
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,220


40
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,680
Some of those calculations are actually

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,870
trickier than it may first appear,

42
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,850
because d1 and d2 also depend on s.

43
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,640
You can give it a try, or see the calculations

44
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,890
in Hull's textbook, or from other sources

45
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,450
if you're curious.

46
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,730
However, for the homework and exam,

47
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,670
you only need to know how to use the formulas shown

48
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,990
in the slides and how to interpret them.

49
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,560
You won't be asked to do any derivations.

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,630
Let's return to the graph we looked at earlier,

51
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,120
where we plotted the current value of a put option

52
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,950
as a function of the underlying stock price.

53
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,310
We assume that the current stock price is 100

54
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,550
and that the option is currently at-the-money.

55
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,160
As before, we can interpret Delta

56
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,710
as the slope of the tangent line at the current stock price.

57
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,480
Notice that, for a put option, that tangent line

58
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,880
has a negative slope everywhere, which

59
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,730
means that the Delta of a put option is always negative.

60
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,110
The Gamma reflects the convexity of this function,

61
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,080
in other words, how much curvature there is.

62
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,930
The higher the Gamma the more curvature.

63
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,620


64
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,990
Well, now, how about a call option?

65
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,170
We can do a similar graphical analysis.

66
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,790


67
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,260
The value curve for a call option will look like this.

68
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,980


69
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,410
Again, assuming the stock price is currently 100.

70
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,590
We can find the slope of the tangent line

71
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,560
at the current stock price.

72
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,520
And that slope represents the Delta of the call option.

73
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,350
You can see that the slope of the value function

74
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,550
is positive everywhere, which means the Delta is positive

75
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,420
everywhere.

76
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,600
And for the Gamma, again, it represents

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,060
the degree of curvature.

78
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,790
The higher the Gamma, the more convexity,

79
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,930
or the more curvature.

80
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,110
This graph shows what happens to the Delta of a caller put

81
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,140
option on the stock as a function of the current value

82
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,140
of the underlying stock and holding all else equal.

83
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,100
As we just established, both algebraically and graphically,

84
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,670
the Delta of the put is always negative.

85
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,050
It's most steeply negative for low stock prices,

86
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,880
and goes to 0 for high stock prices.

87
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,630


88
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,160
We can see that by looking back at the previous graph,

89
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:06,650
where four low stock prices, say, here, the tangent

90
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,530
line is steep.

91
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,330
And for high stock price, say here, the tangent line

92
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,630
is basically flat.

93
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,710
The slope is close to 0.

94
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,540
For a call option, the slope is 0 when the option is very far

95
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,860
out-of-the-money, which is when stock prices are low.

96
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,540
And it increases to 1 when the option is deep into-the-money.

97
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,370
This is a good place to emphasize

98
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,970
that it's this large variation in Deltas with stock prices

99
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,000
that causes the replicating portfolios for options

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,450
to change over time, sometimes quite quickly, when

101
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,940
stock prices make a big move.

102
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,290
Those changes can necessitate frequent portfolio rebalancing

103
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,150
and dynamic hedging strategies.

104
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,890


105
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,790
We saw that the Gamma is the same for a put or call option.

106
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,330
Plotting it is a function of the current stock price.

107
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,240
It's close to 0 for very high or very low

108
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,350
values of the underlying stock, relative to the strike price,

109
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,260
and peaks near the strike price of the option.

110
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,240
This pattern of curvature is also

111
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,070
apparent from looking back at the graph on slide 27.

112
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:30,060
We see here that around the strike price,

113
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,840
the function is quite curved.

114
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,690
But it's fairly straight for high or low values

115
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,500
of the stock.

116
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,000
