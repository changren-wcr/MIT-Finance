00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:02,950
PROFESSOR: The most common use of the Greeks

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,120
is in dynamic hedging strategies involving Delta, or delta gamma

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,050
hedging.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,490
In this last part of this week's class,

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,730
we'll look at delta hedging in detail

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,850
in the context of products that offer protection

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,290
against downside risk arising from the stock market.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,750
Those products were created because investors

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,690
have a taste for securities where their principal is

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,900
protected, but they still share in some of the upside

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,850
if the market turns out to do well.

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,570
Many investment banks offer such securities.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,550
They hedge this short position that

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,790
creates for them in stocks using a combination

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,150
of purchased options and dynamic trading strategies.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,970
Examples of these type of products

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,600
are shown in the MITTS and SUN offering documents

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,470
that are available to you on the class materials page.

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,050
Similar products continue to be offered today.

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,930
The example we will first study in detail

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,470
is for a Capital Protected Note, which is loosely

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,390
based on a security that was issued

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,660
in 2008 by Morgan Stanley.

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,790
In this example, we'll be focusing

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,760
on the perspective of the protection seller, which

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,580
you can imagine is an investment bank that you're working at.

27
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,920
Say it's February 22, 2008, and you're selling

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,800
Capital Protected Notes.

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,550
The note matures on February 20, 2015,

30
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,010
and so it has a seven year life.

31
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,600
The issue price per share is $10,

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,850
as is the principal value per share.

33
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,080
The note pays no interest.

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,090
However, it provides 100% principle protection.

35
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,760
Investors are guaranteed to get at least the amount

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,040
they paid for each share.

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,950
In addition, the payoff at maturity

38
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,980
includes what's called a supplemental redemption

39
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,630
amount, or SRA. That's calculated as 116%

40
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,240
of the share principal multiplied

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,300
by the return of the normalized S&P 500

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,980
over the life of the security if that return is positive.

43
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,030
As the issuer of this security, you want to lock in the gain

44
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,490
from selling the security, which means

45
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,610
hedging against the risk of the short position you've

46
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,040
created for yourself in the S&P 500 index.

47
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,490
We'll look at how you can do this with a dynamic delta

48
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,310
hedging strategy, which means setting up

49
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,420
a replicating portfolio and rebalancing it over time

50
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,770
as market conditions change.

51
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,810
Next week we'll extend this analysis

52
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,900
to the alternative of delta gamma hedging, which

53
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,270
creates a more robust hedge.

54
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,160
This graph shows the payoff at the end

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,340
of seven years on a share of a Capital Protected Note

56
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,760
as a function of the normalized S&P 500 index at that time.

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,800
The shape of the payoff reflects the floor value

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,570
equal to the principal of $10, and then

59
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:21,120
the potential for appreciation as the value of the S&P 500

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,470
index goes up, multiplied by a factor of 116%.

61
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,080
To find the value of the Capital Protected Note,

62
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,390
we decompose the payoff into two components.

63
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,830
The first is a zero coupon bond with the principal,

64
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,780
or equivalently, face value of $10, and maturity of cap T

65
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,960
equals seven years.

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,100
Second, 1.16 at the money call options on a normalized S&P

67
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,565
500, with maturity T equals 7 years.

68
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:59,100


69
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,510
The reference index is normalized,

70
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,340
so that S0 is initially at $10.

71
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,620
To do that, we need to find beta,

72
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,310
such that beta times the S&P 500 index value

73
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,670
is initially equal to $10.

74
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,230
On the issue date, the actual value of the S&P 500

75
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,440
was 1,353.1.

76
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,050
That implies that we can solve for beta

77
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,710
by dividing 10 by 1353.1.

78
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,280
All future values of the index used in the calculations

79
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,060
are also multiplied by this normalization factor.

80
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,140
We also have other data on the issuance date.

81
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,450
The interest rate, r, is equal to 3.23% on a continuously

82
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,190
compounded basis.

83
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,420
The dividend yield on the S&P 500 is taken to be 2%.

84
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,870
The bank's forecasts of market volatility over the seven years

85
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:02,230
is set to sigma of 15% on an annual basis.

86
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,620
Notice, if you go back to the previous slide,

87
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,060
that our payoff diagram could have been constructed

88
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,540
from the two positions we're just talking about,

89
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,740
a zero coupon bond with a face value of $10

90
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,940
plus the call options, which have

91
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,800
a payoff that looks like that.

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,210
And as usual, we can sum the two positions together

93
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,110
to get our total payoff, which was what was

94
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,510
drawn on the original diagram.

95
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,550
Turning back to our calculation of value, with this information

96
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,760
you can estimate the value of the security using

97
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,400
Black-Scholes-Merton for a dividend paying stock

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,100
for the call option component, and adding it

99
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,540
to the present value of the zero coupon bond.

100
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,230
We have, then, the present value of the zero coupon

101
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:08,430
bond, and 1.16 call options, where the current price is $10,

102
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,740
the strike price is $10, and we know our other parameters.

103
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,280
We can solve all of this to find that the present value

104
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:25,890
of the bond is 7.9764, the value of each call option is $1.70,

105
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,380
and we have 1.16 call options in our position.

106
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:36,720
So the total value of the position is $9.94.

107
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,070
Well, that conclusion suggests that the value of the Capital

108
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,610
Protected Note is a little less than the $10

109
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,370
that investors pay for the security.

110
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,500
Effectively, investors are giving up

111
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,650
the interest they would have earned on the $10 principal

112
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,470
in exchange for a call option.

113
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,970
The bank makes $0.05 per share that they issue.

114
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,480
Well, $0.05 is a pretty thin margin,

115
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,080
and the short position is a very risky one,

116
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,230
so the bank wants to hedge that risk to lock

117
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,630
in the $0.05 per share profit.

118
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,830
And we'll now turn to how they can do that.

119
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,840
Since issuing the capital protected note

120
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,000
involves short positions in a bond

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,940
and in call options on the S&P 500,

122
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,310
hedging that exposure requires taking

123
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,610
off setting long positions.

124
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,120
That implies first buying a zero coupon bond

125
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,050
for 7.9764 and with a face value of $10

126
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,160
to hedge the bond component.

127
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,710
Second, to hedge the option component,

128
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,490
buy 1.16 units of the replicating portfolio

129
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,540
for the embedded call option in the Capital Protected Note.

130
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,990
Here's the procedure for setting up that replicating portfolio

131
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,220
for the call.

132
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,690
We first calculate the delta, which we know is n of d1,

133
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,790
and we get a delta of 0.5747.

134
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,050
We also know that we can find the bond position

135
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,030
as being equal to the call minus delta times the current stock

136
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,200
price.

137
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:23,910
That gives us a position in the bond of minus 4.047.

138
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,110
Taking those two positions together,

139
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:37,530
we invest 5.747 in the S&P 500 and borrow 4.047.

140
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,309
We conclude that the net value of the replicating portfolio

141
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:47,640
is the 5.747 minus the 4.047, so it's

142
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,990
equal to 1.7, which, by construction, is

143
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,120
the same as the value of the call option.

144
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,110
The final step is to multiply both the stock and bond

145
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,420
positions in the replicating portfolio

146
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,380
by 1.16 to scale up the replicating portfolio

147
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,130
to match the exposure in the Capital Protected Note.

148
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,960
To ensure that this hedge continues

149
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,210
to be effective over the next seven years,

150
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,430
the bank needs to frequently rebalance

151
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,990
the replicating portfolio as the underlying delta changes.

152
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,640
Remember that the call option delta

153
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,000
will change with the S&P 500 index value,

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,180
with the passage of time, and with any changes in r

155
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,470
and sigma.

156
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,680
You could evaluate the size of those different sensitivities

157
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,390
by calculating the theta, rho, and vega for your exposure.

158
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,190
Notice that the interest rate risk

159
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,690
on the portion of the obligation that's the return of principal

160
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,990
has been fully hedged by investing in a zero coupon

161
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,530
bond whose payoff matches that part of the liability,

162
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,070
and no further adjustments are ever necessary.

163
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,810
With regard to the S&P 500 index, if its value increases,

164
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,500
then the call option delta increases, and conversely,

165
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,570
if it decreases.

166
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,290
As the S&P 500 and any other parameters change,

167
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,310
you can recalculate delta for the replicating portfolio.

168
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,470
The replicating portfolio is then

169
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,740
rebalanced by adjusting the holdings of stocks and bonds

170
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,220
to match the updated option value in delta.

171
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,920
Each time the portfolio is rebalanced,

172
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,620
there may be a gain or loss to the bank.

173
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,620
But if the hedging strategy is effective,

174
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,810
the sum of those gains and losses

175
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,230
will be offset by the gains or losses on the Capital Protected

176
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,220
Note.

177
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,780
An important question to ask is: why do a complicated dynamic

178
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,200
replication here, instead of initially just buying

179
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,400
call options on the S&P 500?

180
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,640
The answer is that call options on the S&P 500

181
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,340
are actively traded for shorter maturities,

182
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,730
but there is unlikely to be adequate liquidity at longer

183
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,740
maturities like seven years.

184
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,660
When liquid options aren't available in the market,

185
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,530
it can be cheaper, particularly for a large bank,

186
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,230
to hedge using a dynamic delta hedging strategy.

187
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,380
In fact, you can think of the $0.05

188
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,870
that the bank earns as compensation

189
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,590
for doing this delta hedging on behalf of investors,

190
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:24,770
who wouldn't be able to do it as inexpensively on their own.
