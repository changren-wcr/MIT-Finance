PROFESSOR: To make it easy to numerically price derivatives

1
00:00:02,458 --> 00:00:04,710
under realistic assumptions about the distribution

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,750
of future stock prices.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,420
For simplicity, and because it can often

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,480
provide a good approximation, stock returns

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,960
are frequently modeled as having a constant expected return, mu,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,600
and a constant volatility, sigma.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,230
That is, over a small interval of time h,

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,270
the expected gross rate of return

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,225
on the stock is e to the mu times h.

10
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:30,790


11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,210
The variance of the gross return is the expectation

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,140
of the squared deviations from the mean return, which we'll

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,970
write as sigma squared times h, where sigma squared represents

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,530
the annualized variance on a continuous basis.

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,750
This specification for variance assumes

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,180
the returns are independently and identically

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,580
distributed over time.

18
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,740
Say now that we want to price an option

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,200
with a maturity of capital T.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,200
We can chop the interval from 0 to T

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,690
into n equally sized subintervals.

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,430
Each interval has a size h of T over n.

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,250
And i times h represents calendar time on the tree.

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,650
To keep the calibration simple, it's standard

25
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,830
to restrict the evolution of the stock prices on the tree

26
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:30,100
so that starting at a node s sub i, at time step i plus 1,

27
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,670
the up node is s i times u, and the down node

28
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:43,050
is s i times d, where d and u are constant.

29
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,430
The probability of an up is q, and the down, of course,

30
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,180
is 1 minus q, where q is also a constant.

31
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,170
Note that q represents here a true, or physical,

32
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,230
or actual probability.

33
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,550
With these restrictions, we have three free variables

34
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:11,200
to match to the known expected return and the known variants.

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,110
The equations here, then, represent the expected return

36
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,280
and variance in terms of those three free variables,

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,405
u, d, and q.

38
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,960


39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,390
Since we have one more free variable

40
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,120
than we have equations to satisfy,

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,430
we use that extra degree of freedom

42
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,150
to further simplify the tree by assuming

43
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,760
that u is equal to 1 over d.

44
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,350


45
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,660
Now, with those three equations and a little bit of algebra,

46
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,870
we can solve for u, d, and q as a function of sigma and mu.

47
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,260


48
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,575
The results will also depend on the step size, h.

49
00:02:57,575 --> 00:03:01,320


50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,810
It's straightforward, then, to program a spreadsheet

51
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,240
to create a tree that's consistent

52
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,290
with these assumptions and a given set of inputs.

53
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,010
The spreadsheet, called binomialtree.xls,

54
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,260
is on the course materials web page.

55
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,380
It's programmed to create a stock price

56
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,510
tree using this procedure.

57
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,720
And it also computes the prices of European put and call

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,190
options.

59
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,770
The spreadsheet was used to create the examples we'll

60
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,750
look at on the next few slides.

61
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,430
You'll also need to use it to solve

62
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,020
some of the homework problems.

63
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,430
And it will be available for you to use on the exam.

64
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,860
The procedure that we just discussed also

65
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,170
works for dividend-paying stocks,

66
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,440
but the stock price process has to be slightly modified

67
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,230
to account for the fact that part of the total return

68
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,360
is in the form of a dividend.

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,500
JR will go over that in the recitation.

70
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,230
The binomialtree.xls spreadsheet is

71
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,515
programmed to incorporate the constant dividend yield.

72
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:04,320


73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,750
Of the inputs and outputs from the spreadsheet

74
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,890
binomialtree.xls and the picture of the resulting stock price

75
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,920
tree, the lighter shaded cells are inputs,

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,920
and the darker cells are outputs.

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,980
Inputs needed for the tree include

78
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,790
mu, the expected return on the stock,

79
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:36,240
sigma, the volatility of the stock, r, the risk-free rate,

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,800
div, the dividend yield, s0, the initial stock price, and then

81
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,210
capital T, the time horizon for the tree in years,

82
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,600
and n, the number of steps in the tree.

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,250
Turning to the outputs used to calculate the stock price tree,

84
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:05,260
the time step h is defined as cap T over n,

85
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,340
as we defined it before.

86
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,820
The other outputs associated with building the tree

87
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,370
are u, d, and q.

88
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,260
Those are calculated using the formulas on the previous slide.

89
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,910
We'll talk about the option inputs

90
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,360
and outputs in a few minutes.

91
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,900
But first, let's look at the stock price tree

92
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,020
that we get from these assumptions.

93
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,640
Each column represents a time step starting at 0,

94
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,020
going out to n, and it's indexed by i.

95
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,410
Each row is a node number, and that's indexed by j.

96
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,430
Each entry in the tree is a stock price node.

97
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,910
The up move from any node is recorded

98
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,840
in the same row but one column to the right,

99
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,350
while a down move is recorded in the next row

100
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,560
and also one column to the right.

101
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,460
For example, we start with the input stock price of 100

102
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,200
at time 0.

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,140


104
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:22,230
The up takes the 100, multiplies it by u, of 1.030455,

105
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:30,210
and gives us 103.045 as the up node at the next step.

106
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,220
When we multiply by d, which is 1 over u,

107
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:42,720
we get the down step, which brings us to a price of 97.045.

108
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,000
