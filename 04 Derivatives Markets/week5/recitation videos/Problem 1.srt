00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,330
J. R. SCOTT: Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,870
And welcome to the fifth recitation of 15.4.35x.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,590
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing two topics.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,630
In the first topic, we'll see how

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,740
we can use the binomial model to numerically calculate the delta

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,960
and gamma of a call option.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,910
In the second topic, we'll see how

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,130
we can use the binomial model to price

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,460
a more exotic option than the European call

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,910
and put options that we've seen in class thus far.

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,460
Without further ado, let's begin with the first topic.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,050
Recall from the week five lecture

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,490
that the so-called Greeks delta, gamma, theta.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,120
rho, and vega are widely used measures

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,790
of the sensitivity of an option's price

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,180
to various factors.

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,180
In particular, delta measures the sensitivity

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,210
of an option's value to changes in the price

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,390
of the underlying security.

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,240
According to the Black-Scholes-Merton model,

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,920
the delta of a European option on a non-dividend paying stock

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,130
has the following analytical expression:

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,430
delta, which is the first derivative of the option's

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,720
price, with respect to the price of the underlying stock,

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,220
is equal to n of d1 for calls and negative n

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,770
of negative d1 for puts.

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,570
Where p is the option's price, n is the cumulative density

28
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,680
function of a standard normally distributed random variable,

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,120
and d1 is as defined in the Black-Scholes-Merton formula

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,140
is a log of the price of the stock, divided

31
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,950
by the strike price, plus the risk free rate, plus one

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,520
half the volatility of the stock,

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,380
times the time to maturity, minus the current period,

34
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,100
divided by the volatility, sigma, times the square root

35
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,910
of T minus t.

36
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,500
It is true more generally and not

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,840
just for the Black-Scholes-Merton model

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,870
that call options will have positive deltas,

39
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,770
while put options will have negative deltas.

40
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,530
OK.

41
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,400
But what if we want to compute the delta of an option

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,910
without invoking the assumptions of the Black-Scholes-Merton

43
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,470
model.

44
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,810
In the week five lecture, we saw how

45
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,930
to calculate the price of a European call option

46
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,660
numerically using the binomial tree

47
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,170
simulator in the BinomialTree.xls spreadsheet.

48
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,530
By varying the price of the underlying stock

49
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,340
and recalculating the option price using the binomial tree

50
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,110
simulator, we can numerically approximate the derivative dP

51
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,440
over dS using the following formula : dP over dS,

52
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,730
the delta of the option, is approximately equal to the new

53
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,350
option price using the binomial tree simulator after varying

54
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,570
the price of the underlying stock,

55
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,930
minus the original option price, divided by the new stock price,

56
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,420
minus the original stock price.

57
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,330
As an example, let's use the BinomialTree.xls spreadsheet

58
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,060
to find the price of a European call option

59
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,160
on a stock with the following parameters:

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,340
note that these are the same parameters that you

61
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,770
saw in the week five lecture.

62
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,980
Mu, the expected return on the stock, is equal to 0.1 or 10%.

63
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,620
Sigma, the volatility of the stock, is equal to 0.3 or 30%.

64
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,190
The risk free rate, r, is equal to 2%.

65
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,500
The dividend yield is 0%.

66
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,550
The original value of the underlying stock is 100.

67
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,020
The strike price of the European call option is 100.

68
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,560
The time to maturity is 0.1.

69
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,470
And the number of intervals is equal to 10.

70
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,260
After inputting all of these parameters on the left hand

71
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,660
side here of the table below, you

72
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,570
should find that the price of the European call option,

73
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,579
according to the binomial model, is 3.787.

74
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,880
According to the binomial tree simulator,

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,070
we see that the price of the underlying

76
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:31,690
stock in the up node at step i equals 1, s1 one superscript u

77
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:38,030
is equal to 103.045, this cell on the spreadsheet.

78
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,950
Similarly, the price of the underlying stock.

79
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,050
in the down node at i equals 1 is S1 superscript

80
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:53,310
d, which is equal to 97.045, this cell on the spreadsheet.

81
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,250
The price of the call option at each step in node

82
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,210
is displayed in the table below.

83
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,270
In particular, the price of the European call option

84
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,830
in the up mode at step i equals 1 is c1 superscript

85
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,050
u, which is equal to 5.381.

86
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,880
The price of the European call option in the down node at step

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,420
i equals 1 is c sub 1 superscript

88
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,470
d, which is equal to 2.221.

89
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,830
We can plug-in S1 superscript u and S1 superscript d

90
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,620
into the numerator of equation one and c1 superscript u

91
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,930
and c1 superscript d into the denominator of equation one,

92
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,220
in order to numerically approximate delta as follows:

93
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,090
delta or dP over dS, is approximately

94
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,870
equal to the difference in the value of the European call

95
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,430
option in the up node at step one in the value

96
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,660
of the European call option in the down node at step 1,

97
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,950
divided by the value of the underlying stock in the up

98
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:12,160
node at step 1, minus the value of the underlying

99
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,000
stock in the down node at step one, which

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,180
is equal to 5.381 minus 2.221, divided by 103.045,

101
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,270
minus 97.045,

102
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:35,650
which gives us an approximate delta of 0.527.

103
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,420
The one thing to notice here is that this

104
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,300
is the exact same output as that reported

105
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,690
by the BinomialTree.xls spreadsheet

106
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,500
in the delta binomial cell, this cell here.

107
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,640


108
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,240
Essentially, the binomial tree simulator in the spreadsheet

109
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,030
calculates the delta of an option using

110
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,980
the u and d implied by the parameterization provided,

111
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,700
where u is equal to the exponential of sigma,

112
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,600
the volatility, times the square root of h, where

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,190
h is the length of the interval, T the maturity,

114
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,800
divided by n, the number of intervals.

115
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,450
Since d equals 1 over u, that is the percentage

116
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,540
increase in the stock is equal to the percentage

117
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,490
decrease in the stock, this numerical approximation

118
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,210
is akin to a symmetric difference quotient.

119
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,690
Alternatively, you could numerically approximate delta

120
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,210
by using a baseline parameterization,

121
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,570
like the one we have above for the binomial tree

122
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,570
to get these so-called original stock and option

123
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,680
prices in equation one and then vary the stock price

124
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,630
by a given amount in a single direction,

125
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,090
for example, a 6% increase, to get the new stock

126
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,270
and option prices.

127
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,090
As opposed to the symmetric difference quotient

128
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,570
that the binomial tree spreadsheet is providing,

129
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,810
this would be more akin to a one-sided difference quotient.

130
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,660
Now that we've seen how to numerically

131
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,120
approximate the delta of an option using

132
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,880
the binomial model, can we do the same thing

133
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,210
for the other Greeks?

134
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,610
Well, as discussed in the week five lecture,

135
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,970
gamma measures the sensitivity of delta,

136
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,500
changes in the price of the underlying security.

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,809
According to the Black-Scholes-Merton model,

138
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:37,370
the gamma of a European option, either a put or a call,

139
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,710
on a non dividend paying stock has

140
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,030
the following analytical expression:

141
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,210
gamma, which is the second derivative of the options

142
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,880
price, with respect to the price of the underlying stock,

143
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,760
is itself equal to the first derivative of the options

144
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,870
delta, with respect to the price of the underlying stock, which

145
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,890
is equal to the derivative of the cumulative distribution

146
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,190
function of a standard normally distributed range

147
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,560
of variable n of d1, divided by the price of the underlying

148
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,670
stock, times its volatility, sigma,

149
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,630
multiplied by the square root of its time to maturity, T,

150
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,420
where the first derivative of the cumulative distribution

151
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,900
function for a standard normal random variable

152
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,720
is given in this expression here:

153
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,920
mathematically, gamma measures the curvature of an options

154
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,360
price, with respect to the price of the underlying security.

155
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,670
Can we numerically approximate gamma

156
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,220
like we just did for delta?

157
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,370
The answer unsurprisingly is, of course.

158
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,420
The only difference now is that our numerical approximation

159
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,140
formula has in its numerator the difference

160
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,240
between the new value of the options delta after changing

161
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,050
the underlying stock price, minus the original value

162
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,050
of the options delta, divided by the difference

163
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,860
between the new stock price and the original stock price.

164
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,020
Whereas before, we had the difference

165
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,840
between the new price of the option,

166
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,680
minus the original price of the option.

167
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,130
For example, let's assume the same parameterization

168
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,800
for the European call option as above,

169
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,220
in particular with a current underlying stock price

170
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,260
S0 of 100.

171
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,470
Using the BinomialTree.xls spreadsheet,

172
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,320
we can calculate the delta for a symmetric 3% increase and 3%

173
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,260
decrease in the stock price.

174
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,140
In particular, for the 3% increase,

175
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,030
we plug-in S0 equals 100, times 1.03,

176
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,990
which equals 103 and find the delta of the call option

177
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,870
to be 0.647.

178
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:05,740
For the 3% decrease, we plug-in S0 equals 100, times 0.97,

179
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,240
which equals 97 and find the delta of the call option

180
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,000
to be 0.401.

181
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,990
Finally, we just apply equation two, but now

182
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,840
with the original values of delta and the stock price,

183
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,650
these two values here corresponding to the 3%

184
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:32,050
decrease case and the new values of delta and the stock price,

185
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,420
these two values here, corresponding

186
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,650
to the 3% increase case.

187
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,150
Overall, we have that the gamma of the call option

188
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:49,500
is approximately equal to 0.647 minus 0.401,

189
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:57,544
divided by 103, minus 97, which is equal to 0.041.

190
00:11:57,544 --> 00:11:59,000
