00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760


1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,860
PROFESSOR: That concludes the first topic.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,280
Now let's see how we can use the binomial model

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,070
to price an exotic option.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,190
In the week five lecture, we saw how the binomial model

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,210
can be used to price European call and put options.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,950
However, the binomial model is far more powerful.

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,800
And it can also be used to price more, quote,

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,150
"exotic" options with very complex payment structures.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,570
For example, assume that a firm has

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,350
decided to offer a new type of exotic equity option.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,340
The expiration date of the option is two periods from now.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,860
And the option is not initially specified

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,030
to either be a put or a call.

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,150
Instead, the owner of the option makes this choice

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,610
after one period.

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,650
Once the choice is made the option

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,510
could be exercised at any time, just like an American option.

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,240
For example, if after one period the owner

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,390
chose for the new exotic option to be a put,

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,580
it would at that time become identical

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,880
to an ordinary American put option with the one period

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,910
remaining until expiration.

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,850
A customer is asked for a quote for an option

24
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:25,200
of this type on FA Inc. stock that has a strike price of 100.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,400
The current price of FA Inc. stock is 100 per share.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,650
In over each period, the stock price

27
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,200
evolves as shown in the tree diagram below.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
The risk neutral probability of an up move in this case,

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,440
is 0.5.

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,420
The stock doesn't pay any dividends.

31
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,360
And the interest rate is 10% per period.

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,250
What is the lowest price the firm

33
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,270
could charge for the option and still break even?

34
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,130
Let's begin by first defining some notation.

35
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,700
Let C of S comma n and P of S comma n

36
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,500
be the values of American call and put options respectively,

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,350
when the underlying stock price is S

38
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,640
and there are n periods remaining until maturity.

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,910
As always, we begin to answer these questions

40
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,820
by finding the payoffs of both call

41
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,210
and put options at each node by moving

42
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,160
backwards through the tree.

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,710
Two periods from now, that is when

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,890
n, the number of periods remaining until maturity,

45
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,860
equals zero, the payoff of a call option

46
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,380
will be 256 minus the strike price of 100, which

47
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,520
equals 156 in the up-up node.

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,275
This node here.

49
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,950


50
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,880
0 in either the up-down or down-up node.

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,860
This one here, and also 0 in the down-down node.

52
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,680
This one here.

53
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,650
Similarly, the payoff of a put option

54
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,070
will be 0 in the up-up node.

55
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,490
100 minus 96, which is equal to 4,

56
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,640
in the up-down or down-up nodes.

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,550
And 100 minus 36, which equals 64, in the down-down node.

58
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,740
What would be the values of the call

59
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,310
and put options in each node one period from now--

60
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,160
that is, when n equals 1--

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,500
given the payoffs in each node at n

62
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,080
equals 0 that we just calculated,

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,610
the risk neutral probability of an up move of 0.5,

64
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,900
and an interest rate of 10% per period?

65
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,590
Let's begin by assuming that we are in the up node at n equals

66
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,600
1, and the stock price is 160.

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,570
On the tree diagram, we are in this node here.

68
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,360


69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,170
If we choose to exercise the call option at this node--

70
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,780
remember this is an American call option--

71
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,160
then its payoff will be 160 minus the strike price of 100,

72
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,580
which is equal to 60.

73
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,089
Alternatively, if we choose to wait to exercise the call

74
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,800
option in the next period, that is at n equals 0,

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,330
then the value of the call option

76
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,500
is equal to the risk neutral probability of an up

77
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,370
move of 0.5 times 156--

78
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,260
that's the payoff of the call option in the up-up node at n

79
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,940
equals 0--

80
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,310
plus 0.5 times 0, which is the payoff of the call

81
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,070
option in the up-down node at n equals 0.

82
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,680
Discount that at the risk-free rate of 10%--

83
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,130
so divide by 1.1--

84
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,700
and we get 70.9091.

85
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,960
Thus, the value of the call option in the up node at n

86
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:12,500
equals 1, which we call C of 160, 1, is the maximum of 60--

87
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,290
that is the payoff if we choose to exercise the call

88
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,970
option at this node--

89
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,430
and the payoff from waiting.

90
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:25,680
The maximum of these two values is 70.9091.

91
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,300
A similar calculation for the put option at the up node at n

92
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,320
equals 1, you'll see value of P of 160,

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,610
1, which is equal to the maximum of the difference

94
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,480
between the strike price of 100 and the price of the stock

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:50,330
of 160, and the probability of an up move in a risk

96
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,290
neutral sense, times the payoff in the up-up mode

97
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,880
on the put option of 0, plus the probability of an up move

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,870
in a risk neutral sense, times the payoff of the put option

99
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,770
in the up-down node discounted at the risk-free rate of 10%,

100
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,237
which is the maximum of negative 60

101
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:18,320
and 1.8182, which is equal to 1.8182.

102
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,970
Now let's assume that we are in the down node at n equals 1,

103
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,190
and the stock price is 60.

104
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,030
So on the payoff diagram we are at this node here.

105
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,490


106
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,210
If we choose to exercise the call option at this node,

107
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,160
then its payoff will be the difference

108
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,910
between the stock price of 60 and the strike

109
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,410
price of the option of 100, which is equal to negative 40.

110
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,190
Alternatively, if we choose to wait to exercise this call

111
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,670
option in the next period at n equals 0,

112
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,050
then the value of the call option

113
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,630
is equal to the risk neutral probability of an up

114
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,200
move of 0.5 times the payoff of the call

115
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,790
option in the down-up node of 0, plus the risk

116
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,710
neutral probability of a down move of 0.5 times the payoff

117
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,820
of the call option in the down-down node of 0,

118
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,360
which discounted at the risk free rate of 10%

119
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,810
is equal to zero.

120
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,710
Thus, the value of the call option in the down node at n

121
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:33,940
equals 1 is C of 60, 1, which is the maximum of negative 40,

122
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,700
has the payoff if we choose to exercise the call

123
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,670
option at this node and the payoff

124
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,210
from waiting to exercise the call option of 0,

125
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,880
which is equal to zero.

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,850
A similar calculation for the put option,

127
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,050
you'll see value of P of 60, 1, which

128
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,290
is the maximum of the difference between the strike

129
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,460
price of the put option of 100 and the price

130
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,060
of the stock at the down node at n equals 1 of 60,

131
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,720
and the probability of an up move in the risk

132
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,460
neutral sense of 0.5 times the payoff of the put option

133
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,970
in the down-up mode at n equals 1, 4 plus the risk

134
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,800
neutral probability of a down move of 0.5 times the payoff

135
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,370
in the put option in the down-down node at n

136
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:36,039
equals 0 of 64 discounted at the risk free rate of 10%,

137
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,980
which is equal to the maximum of 40 and 30.9091,

138
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,640
which is equal to 40.

139
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,570
A lot of numbers are floating around here.

140
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,370
So to summarize, the values of the call and put options at n

141
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,970
equals 1, that is one period from the initiation

142
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,950
of the option, are as follows.

143
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,510


144
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,960
The value of the call option in the up mode at n

145
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,740
equals 1 is 70.9091.

146
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,640
The value of the put option in the up node n

147
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,050
equals 1 is equal to 1.8182.

148
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,135
The value of the call option in the down node at n

149
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:19,450
equals 1 is 0.

150
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,330
And the value of the put option in the down node at n

151
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,820
equals 1 is equal to 40.

152
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,540
Now armed with that information, we can determine two things.

153
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,500
First, whether or not the buyer of the option

154
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,530
will choose for the option to be a put

155
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,490
or a call option at each node at n equals 1.

156
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,770
And second, whether or not the buyer

157
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:47,110
will exercise the put or call option early at n equals 1,

158
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,590
or wait until n equals 0 to exercise the option.

159
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,620
First, let's consider the down node at n

160
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,180
equals 1 when the stock price falls to 60.

161
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,010
By comparing the value of the call

162
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,210
option in the down node at n equals 1 and the put option,

163
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,570
we see that the put option is the better choice.

164
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,060
Thus, the buyer will choose for the option

165
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,270
to be a put at the down node at n equals 1.

166
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,850
Second, we could see that the put

167
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,700
will be exercised immediately.

168
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,420
This comes from the calculation for the value of the put option

169
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,140
in the down node at n equals 1, which

170
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,900
was comparing the value of early exercise

171
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,440
of the put option of 40 and the value of waiting,

172
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,800
which was 30.9091.

173
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,780
Since the value of early exercise

174
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,850
is greater than the value of waiting,

175
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,760
we know that the buyer will choose for the put option

176
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,490
to be exercised immediately.

177
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,640
Now let's consider the case that the stock price instead

178
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,610
goes up to 160 in the up node at n equals 1.

179
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,830
When comparing the value of the call option

180
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,170
and the put option in this node, we

181
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,840
see that the call option is a better bet.

182
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,450
So the buyer will choose for the option in this node

183
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,660
to be a call.

184
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,850
Second, we could tell that the call will

185
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,500
be held until its expiration, because

186
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,230
in the up node n equals 1 when the stock price is 160,

187
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,070
the value of exercising the call option at that node

188
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,090
is 60, whereas the value of waiting to exercise the call

189
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,710
option is 70.9091.

190
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,900
Thus, it makes sense for the buyer

191
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,600
to hold the call until its expiration.

192
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,170


193
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,770
Finally, given the optimal exercise policy detailed above,

194
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,730
we can find the current value of the option, that

195
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,020
is the value at n equals 2, by discounting the expected

196
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,450
payoffs from exercising the put option in the down node at n

197
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,965
equals 1 and holding the call option

198
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:01,130
in the up node at n equals 1.

199
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,130
The current value of the option is given by the expression

200
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,260
below.

201
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,960
The risk neutral probability of an up move

202
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,410
of 0.5 times the value of the call

203
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,980
option in the up node that n equals

204
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:22,090
1, which is equal to 70.9091, plus the risk

205
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,060
neutral probability of a down move at n

206
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,000
equals 1 times the value of a put

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,040
option at the down node at n equals 1, which is equal to 40,

208
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,510
discounted at the risk-free rate of interest,

209
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,860
which is equal to 50.4132.

210
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,830
So the value of our option at initiation of the payoff

211
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:53,100
diagram is equal to 50.4132.

212
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,040
Well that concludes recitation five.

213
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,540
Thank you everyone for coming.

214
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,530
And I look forward to seeing you next week.
