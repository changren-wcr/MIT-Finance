00:00:01,255 --> 00:00:03,130
PROFESSOR: In the last segment for this week,

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,770
I want to turn to how the price of a forward contract

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,260
changes over time and its relevance

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,310
for hedging and speculative strategies.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,210


6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,560
So far, we've focused on how prices of new forward contracts

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,810
are set.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,930
We've seen that those prices imply that initially, it's

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,280
free to enter into a longer short position on the contract.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,500
Over time, though, as market conditions change,

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,700
so does the value of an existing forward contract.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,010
What happens to the forward price over time

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,030
affects the success of hedges or speculative strategies.

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,830
It's also important when traders want

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,940
to exit a contract before expiration, for instance,

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,360
because the asset that was being hedged has been sold.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,720
A forward contract can be exited by taking an offsetting

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,310
forward position.

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,800
If you're long a contract you want to get out of,

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,459
you can enter the short side of the identical contract,

21
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,990
and vice versa to get out of a short position.

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,960
Alternatively, you can sell the contract

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,770
to another trader for its current value.

24
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,200
In either case, closing out the contract

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,500
will entail a gain or loss if the forward price has changed

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,020
from its original value.

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,060
Here's the algebra.

28
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,000
We'll call k the original forward price

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,710
specified in the contract.

30
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,450
We're looking at time 0.

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,310
The same contract, were written at a later time-- little t--

32
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,740
would have a forward price--

33
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,570
capital F, sub little t--

34
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,600
based on current market conditions and the remaining

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,170
maturity of the contract, which at this point is capital T,

36
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,300
minus little t.

37
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,330
By the principle of no arbitrage,

38
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,780
the value at any time T of a long position

39
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,440
is going to be the present value of the difference

40
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,560
between the current forward price

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,150
and the original forward price.

42
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,610


43
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,580
A good exercise is to try to describe the training

44
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,160
strategy that generates an arbitrage

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,340
profit if this relationship doesn't hold.

46
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,340
A forward contract, as we know, is always

47
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,830
zero sum between the long and short contract holders.

48
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,880
So the value of the short position over time

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,660
will still be the negative of the value of the long position.

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,670


51
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,980
Well, hedging with the forward contract

52
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,200
involves taking the opposite position

53
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,770
in the forward contract from your spot and exposure.

54
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,170
For example, say you currently own

55
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,280
100 shares of Alphabet stock as part of your portfolio,

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,920
and you want to lock in a current future selling

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,480
price for the shares.

58
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,600
You could do that by shorting a forward contract on 100

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,360
shares of the Alphabet stock.

60
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,800
For that hedge to be effective, the forward and spot prices

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,140
of the cash and forward position have

62
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,140
to move together over time.

63
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,610
The difference between the spot price and the forward price

64
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,010
is called the basis.

65
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,960
An important fact about the basis

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,810
is that it always goes to 0 on the expiration

67
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,830
date of a forward contract.

68
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,190
Otherwise, one could buy spot and sell

69
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:34,050
forward, or vice versa, and capture an arbitrage profit.

70
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,550
However, as the graph here illustrates,

71
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,730
the basis can be wide prior to expiration.

72
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,970
And there's uncertainty about how that basis is

73
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,170
going to move over time.

74
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,950
For example, a big change in the convenience yield

75
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,580
of a commodity could cause its basis to jump.

76
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,480
Also note that the basis can be positive or negative, depending

77
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,740
on market conditions.

78
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,390
When a hedge is set up that will be closed out

79
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,200
prior to contract expiration, this basis risk

80
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,350
can be quite significant, and means that the hedge may not

81
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,390
be very effective.

82
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,390
Well, this brings us to the related issue of cross hedging.

83
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,570
It's frequent that a contract in one type of security

84
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,780
or commodity is used to hedge a risk

85
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,420
exposure in a different, but related, security or commodity.

86
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,610
So for example, an electric utility

87
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,280
might hedge some of its production costs

88
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,730
using contracts on West Texas crude oil,

89
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,460
even though the oil that it uses in production

90
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,920
comes from a different source.

91
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,330
Why do a cross hedge?

92
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,250
Well, often the reason to cross hedge

93
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,100
is for liquidity and to reduce transactions costs.

94
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,740
Certain forward contracts, such as those

95
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,580
traded on futures exchanges, are more available and more liquid

96
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,380
than others, making them less expensive to transact in.

97
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,360
The disadvantage of cross hedging, as we saw,

98
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,930
is that the basis risk tends to be greater,

99
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,910
reducing the quality of the hedge.

100
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,340
In setting up a hedge using forward contracts,

101
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,100
a fundamental question is how to choose the size

102
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,680
of your forward position.

103
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,710
That question is answered by calculating a hedge ratio.

104
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,500
The hedge ratio is the relative number

105
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,760
of units of assets in the forward contract to units

106
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,880
of assets being hedged that maximizes

107
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,380
the effectiveness of the hedge.

108
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,270
In order to have the same total price

109
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,550
change in your spot in forward positions

110
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,400
to create that offset, it must be

111
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,690
that the size of the spot position multiplied

112
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,830
by the expected change in the price per unit

113
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,360
is equal to the size of the forward position

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,430
times the expected change in the forward price, again per unit.

115
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,380


116
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,010
Rearranging this equation gives the hedge ratio,

117
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,870
which is the size of the spot position relative to the size

118
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,040
of the forward position in terms of the relative expected price

119
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,810
changes.

120
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,590
To implement a hedge ratio in practice,

121
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,350
you'll need to have an estimate of the expected price

122
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,540
change, both for your spot and forward positions.

123
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,640
One of the homework problems asks

124
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,260
you to do this in the context of hedging a stock position.

125
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,260
To answer it, you'll need to recall what you learned earlier

126
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,350
in the MicroMasters Program about expected stock

127
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,880
returns and the CAPM.
