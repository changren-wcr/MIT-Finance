PROFESSOR: Forward contracts are the most widely used tools

1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,520
for risk management in the world.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,270
Notice that the term risk management encompasses

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,420
the idea of hedging or reducing risk,

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,090
such as when a farmer uses a forward contract

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,670
to lock in the selling price of his wheat.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,740
But the term risk management also

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,740
encompasses speculative trades, such as when

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,900
the buy side of that forward contract

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,960
doesn't plan to use the wheat but instead is

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,720
taking a calculated risk that the price of the wheat

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,360
will exceed the forward price paid.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,990
Other derivative contracts, such as futures and swaps,

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,930
are particular types of forward contracts.

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,850
We'll talk about those next week.

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,760
Let's start with a precise definition

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,860
of a forward contract.

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,960
A forward contract is an agreement

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,240
between two counterparties to trade a pre-specified amount

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,500
of goods or securities at a pre-specified future date,

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,960
which we'll call capital T, for a pre-specified forward price,

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,830
capital F subzero, where 0 denotes that the time is now.

22
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,250
It's free to enter a forward contract initially.

23
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,350
However, to ensure that both sides meet their obligations,

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,200
collateral often has to be posted.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,620
Sometimes forward contracts call for a payment

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,010
up front instead of a contract expiration.

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,030
That's called a prepaid forward contract.

28
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,730
The price in a prepaid forward contract

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,030
is just the present value of the regular forward price,

30
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,640
but otherwise, the two types of contracts are identical.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,190
I'm mentioning this because we'll

32
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,950
see that the prepaid price is mathematically

33
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,320
quite useful in some hedging applications

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,730
that we'll look at.

35
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,780
The key observation that's used for pricing forward contracts

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,380
is that the pre-specified forward price of 0

37
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,500
must be set to ensure that the value of the contract

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,260
is 0 from the perspective of both counterparties

39
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,220
at inception.

40
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,410
This has to be the case, since it's

41
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,110
free to enter the contract.

42
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,110
Some important terminology is that the buyer

43
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,330
of the asset in the forward contract

44
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,730
is on the long side of the contract.

45
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,410
The buyer has taken a long position.

46
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,560
On the other side, the seller is on the short side

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,330
of the contract and is said to be short the contract.

48
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,670
Two other important features--

49
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,550
first, most forward contracts trade

50
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,730
over the counter, which means through privately

51
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,060
arranged trades rather than on an exchange.

52
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,000
Brokers and dealers often serve as intermediaries,

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,490
matching sellers with buyers.

54
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,270
OK.

55
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,370
Importantly, forward contracts can

56
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,550
involve the physical delivery of the underlying asset

57
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,680
or they can be cash settled.

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,620
With physical delivery, as it sounds,

59
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,680
the underlying asset is delivered to the buyer

60
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,980
by the seller in exchange for the forward price.

61
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,860
Cash settlement, which involves a payment linked

62
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,320
to the current price of the underlying commodity,

63
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,140
is convenient in cases where physical delivery

64
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,730
is costly or complicated.

65
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,240
For example, imagine the difficulty

66
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,260
of having to deliver all 500 stocks in the right proportions

67
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,230
on an S&P 500 forward contract.

68
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,110
Such contracts are typically cash settled

69
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,210
to avoid those complications.

70
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,820
We will see that the financial value of the contract

71
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,050
is the same with either physical or with cash settlement.

72
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,700
It's fairly straightforward to find

73
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,890
the profit or loss on a forward contract at expiration.

74
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,660
In general, we'll call s sub T the spot

75
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,230
price, or current market price, of the underlying asset

76
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,830
in the contract at time little t.

77
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,195
Assume, too, that the contract covers n units of the asset.

78
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,820


79
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,330
The payoff will depend on the number of units

80
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,440
and on the difference between the current spot price

81
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,810
and the forward price locked in on the contract.

82
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,470
Let's look at this from the perspective of the long side

83
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,779
of the contract.

84
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:23,960
The long earns the spot price minus the forward price

85
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,500
on n units of the asset.

86
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,970
That corresponds to the long ping of sub-0 per unit,

87
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,830
and then receiving the n assets via the forward contract,

88
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,030
and then turning around and selling the assets at the spot

89
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,320
price s capital T in the spot market.

90
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,110
Clearly, the profit or loss to the short side

91
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,450
is just the negative of the profit or loss

92
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,870
to the long side.

93
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,660
The contract is always zero-sum between them.

94
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,660
The questions in this box are a useful check

95
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,650
on your basic understanding of how forward contracts work,

96
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,680
the payoffs to both sides, and why

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,490
the contract can create value for users even though they

98
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,600
are zero-sum.

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,620
In the recitation, JR will discuss these answers with you,

100
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,930
but it's a good exercise to think about them

101
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,230
and discuss them with your fellow students beforehand.

102
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,240
This figure summarizes the timing

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,910
of cash flows and payoffs that we've been talking about.

104
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,940
The forward price is agreed to between the long and short

105
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,560
sides of the contract at time 0.

106
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,040
No money changes hands, but either

107
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,600
or both counterparties may have to post collateral

108
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,650
to protect against default. At contract expiration,

109
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,890
the profit or loss per unit of the underlying

110
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,100
depends on the difference between the forward price set

111
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,200
and the contract and the current spot price.

112
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,340
The payoff is zero-sum between the long side of the contract

113
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,790
and the short side of the contract.

114
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,000
