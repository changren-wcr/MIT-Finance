PROFESSOR: We can now turn back to payoff diagrams

1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,550
as a way to understand why a long position

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,180
in a forward contract is like a highly-leveraged position

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,160
in the underlying asset.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,280
For this example, let's consider a forward contract

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,410
on a share of stock which locks in a forward price of $65

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,850
to buy a share.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,390
We'll construct a portfolio of the underlying

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,080
stock and a risk-free, zero-coupon bond that

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,370
has payoffs that are identical to our forward contract.

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,970
Let's start with the bond.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,570
The first path diagram here is the payoff

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,240
on a zero-coupon bond with a face

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,530
value of $65 that matures on the same day

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,450
as the forward contract on the stock

15
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,040
that we want to compare it with.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,550


17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,820
The payoff on a long position in the bond

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,470
is $65 no matter what the value of the underlying stock

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,370
is on the expiration or maturity date of the contract.

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,260
Hence, the payoff diagram shows a horizontal line at $65.

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,880


22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,340
For a short position in the bond,

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,730
the payoff is also invariant to the stock price.

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,460
The seller of the bond on a short position

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,000
is out the face value of the $65 no matter

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,390
what happens to the price of the underlying stock.

27
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,467
Hence, the payoff diagram shows a horizontal line at minus $65.

28
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:43,440


29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,420
Now let's look at the payoff diagram

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,020
for long and short positions in the underlying stock.

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,200
If you own the stock, its value on the expiration date

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,350
of the forward contract is whatever the stock price

33
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,090
is on that same day.

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,180
Hence, the payoff increases one-for-one with the stock

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,240
price as in the top diagram.

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,030
And as for the bond, a short position

37
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,389
in the stock on a payoff diagram flips

38
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,000
the outcomes over the x-axis.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,840
A short position involves a loss of the value on the expiration

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,840
date equal to the price of the stock that day.

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,600
Hence, the payoff decreases one-for-one

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,810
with the stock price as in the lower diagram here.

43
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,630
Let's consider the payoff on a long forward contract

44
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,770
in the stock with a forward price of $65.

45
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,720
We know that the payoff at expiration

46
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,580
will be the difference between the stock

47
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,770
price on that date minus the $65 paid in the forward contract.

48
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,670
The payoff, therefore, increases linearly and one-for-one

49
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,570
in the price of the stock starting at minus $65

50
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,370
if the stock price is $0.

51
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,270


52
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,390
And, finally, let's compare the payoff diagram

53
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,590
on the forward contract to the one for a portfolio that's

54
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,390
long one share of the stock and short a zero-coupon bond

55
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,840
with a face value of $65 that matures

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,850
on the same date as the forward contract.

57
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,930
The payoff on that portfolio is found by vertically adding

58
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,450
the payoffs we found earlier.

59
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,520
The short bond always has a payoff of minus $65.

60
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,750
And the stock value increases one-for-one in the stock price.

61
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,120
The result is plotted on the bottom diagram.

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,500
We can see that no matter what happens to the underlying stock

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,200
price, the payoff on the forward contract

64
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,980
will be identical to the payoff on the portfolio consisting

65
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,830
of a share of the stock and the short bond.

66
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,580
This can be described, then, as a highly-leveraged position

67
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,890
in the stock because shorting a bond

68
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,470
is borrowing and the borrowed money

69
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,800
is used to help fund the stock purchase.

70
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,980
In other words, a so-called leveraged position

71
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,900
is one that is funded in part by borrowing.

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,360
This equivalence between a forward contract

73
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,910
and its replicating portfolio will also

74
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,600
be key to pricing forward contracts.

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,360
The bottom line is that long forward contracts

76
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,990
allow market participants to take highly-leveraged positions

77
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,030
in the risky underlying asset with little

78
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,390
or no money down, even if they couldn't do so directly

79
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,330
by borrowing and buying the risky asset.

80
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,170
A similar analysis implies that forward short positions

81
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,050
are equivalent to lending and going

82
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,940
short in the underlying asset.

83
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,400
This provides short risk exposure

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,770
to an underlying asset, either to hedge or to speculate, again

85
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,500
with no money down.

86
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,000
