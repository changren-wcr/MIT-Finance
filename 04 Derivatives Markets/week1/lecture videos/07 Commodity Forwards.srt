1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,870
PROFESSOR: Some of the oldest and most

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,880
important foreign contracts were designed

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,010
to help farmers and industrial firms

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,680
hedge some of their largest risk exposures.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,330
These contracts are for commodities

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,720
such as oil, metals, and major agricultural commodities.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,310
Unlike financial assets that are essentially costless to store

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,620
and whose returns are in cash and so

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,290
equally valuable to all investors,

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,720
the situation is more complicated

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,610
for these storable commodities.

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,750


13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,790
The main costs are for storage.

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,000
We'll denote by a capital U any lump sum costs,

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,160
like monthly facility fees, and use a small u

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,570
to represent storage costs on a proportional flow basis.

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,690
Storage costs vary over time and with the availability

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,510
and demand for space which, in turn, will

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,240
depend on the demand for the underlying commodity.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,800
There's also the offsetting notion

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,050
of a convenience yield, which measures

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,989
the benefit of physically having possession of a commodity.

23
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,010
For example, if you have oil on-hand,

24
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,510
it insures against supply disruptions

25
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,250
that could cause costly production slowdowns.

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,070
Mathematically adjusting for storage costs and convenience

27
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,990
yields and forward pricing formulas

28
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,380
is analogous to the adjustments for dividend or coupon payments

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,530
that we talked about for financial forward contracts.

30
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,020
Storage costs are like negative dividends

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
and convenience yields are like positive dividends.

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,160


33
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,200
Now let's take a close look at the formulas

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,770
for the forward prices of storable commodities.

35
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,530
As with financial forwards, all of these formulas

36
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,170
involve the current spot price of the underlying,

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,240
the risk-free rate, and the time horizon

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,410
of the forward contract.

39
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,770
Then we'll have to make adjustments for storage costs

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,100
and convenience yields, just as we did for dividends and coupon

41
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,670
payments in the financial asset case.

42
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,160
Looking at the first formula, where there are just

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,970
lumps some storage costs, the forward price has to be higher

44
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,120
to compensate for the value of those storage costs which

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,640
are incurred by the short side of the contract.

46
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,360


47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,235
When the storage costs are incurred

48
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:22,760
as a proportional flow, the same logic

49
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,905
leads to the second equation.

50
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:29,390


51
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,970
When there's a positive convenience yield,

52
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,700
the value of those services to the short side

53
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,635
causes forward prices to be lower.

54
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:41,730


55
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,090
In the last equation, which is the more general case,

56
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,510
there are both storage costs and a convenience yield that

57
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,240
pull in opposite directions.

58
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,280
Over time, as interest rates, storage costs, and convenience

59
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,830
yields change with market conditions,

60
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,900
you can see that the forward price will change

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,515
and it can be higher or lower than the current spot price.

62
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:09,600


63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,810
These formulas also arise from the no-arbitrage logic

64
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,610
of Cash-and-Carry trading strategies.

65
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,480
However, because storage costs and convenience yields

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,570
can vary considerably across market participants

67
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,930
and across time, they can be difficult to identify.

68
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,880


69
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,210
The offsetting effect on forward prices of storage costs

70
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,290
and convenience yields also vary with the forward contract

71
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,330
maturity.

72
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,300
At any point in time and for any commodity

73
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,700
on which forward contracts are available,

74
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,490
we can plot a forward curve.

75
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,950
The forward curve gives the relationship

76
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,200
between the forward price and the maturity of the contract.

77
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,710
Notice that the short end of the forward curve

78
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,310
is always fixed at the current spot price of the commodity

79
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,020
by a no-arbitrage condition that forward prices converge to spot

80
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,210
prices as contracts mature.

81
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,940
When the forward curve is upward-sloping,

82
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,210
the forward market is said to be in contango

83
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,360
and when the forward curve is downward-sloping,

84
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,242
it's called backwardation.

85
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:23,780


86
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,950
This graph shows a variation in the forward curve

87
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,510
for a commonly traded type of oil known as West Texas

88
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,000
Intermediate, or WTI.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720


90
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,880
The solid line is the spot price at each date on the x-axis.

91
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,470


92
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,510
The forward curve, starting at the selected date,

93
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,750
is also plotted as a dashed line.

94
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,630
You can see that backwardation is

95
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,050
more common than contango over this period

96
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,120
but that both situations occur.

97
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,090


98
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,320
Looking back at the formulas, for backwardation to occur

99
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,840
requires that the convenience yield

100
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,720
is greater than the combined effect of storage

101
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,460
costs and the interest rate.

102
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,440


103
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,800
Interestingly, more recently, there

104
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,610
was an episode where spot oil prices went negative

105
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,910
because demand plummeted.

106
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:34,210
And it isn't possible to quickly turn off oil pumps.

107
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,240
Storage capacity was completely exhausted

108
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,290
and the price of storage became very high.

109
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,510
During that episode, what do you think

110
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,890
happened to the forward curve?

111
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,590
Well, we can answer that question by, again,

112
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,870
referring back to our pricing formula that relates forward

113
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,110
price to the spot price, the interest rate, storage

114
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,500
costs, and convenience yields.

115
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,350
Nothing special happened to the interest rates.

116
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,890
And holding oil became more of an inconvenience

117
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,900
than a convenience.

118
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,285
Storage costs went up sharply.

119
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:18,520


120
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,110
We would then expect to see a sharply upward-sloping

121
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,975
forward curve, and that is in fact what happened.

122
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:30,600


123
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,490
Forward contracts are also written

124
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,030
on non-storable or short-lived commodities like electricity

125
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,220
or fresh fruit and vegetables.

126
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,860
For such products, forward prices

127
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,620
are not tied to current spot prices

128
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,230
by no-arbitrage conditions.

129
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,530
Rather, for these non-storable commodities,

130
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,920
forward prices contain additional information

131
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,970
over spot prices about expected future market conditions.

132
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,900
For example, if a future strawberry harvest

133
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,500
is expected to be low because of too little rain,

134
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,140
the forward price will be higher than if a bumper

135
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,140
crop had been expected.

136
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,120
Estimating the fair forward price

137
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,520
for non-storable commodities then

138
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,570
involves modeling stochastic future supply and demand

139
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,840
and also determining an appropriate risk-adjusted

140
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,680
discount rate.

141
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,130


142
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,920
Let's take stock of what we've learned

143
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,040
about the pricing of forward contracts for financial assets

144
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,980
and storable commodities and draw out

145
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,530
some surprising implications that are

146
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,730
important for you to remember.

147
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,870
If you look back at any of the formulas we've discussed,

148
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,590
a surprising and important fact is that the forward price

149
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,550
doesn't reflect any information about future market conditions

150
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,180
beyond what is reflected in the current spot price.

151
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,180
That's because forward prices are tied down

152
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,380
by no-arbitrage conditions that only involve the current spot

153
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,830
price, the risk-free rate, and anticipated cash flows.

154
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,150
This means that it's a mistake to try to use forward prices

155
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,070
to predict future spot prices.

156
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,490
For example, let's think about the forward price

157
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,210
of a non-dividend-paying stock, say on Tesla,

158
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,580
and compare it to the expected future price

159
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,179
of the stock on the expiration date of the forward contract.

160
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,299
Which is higher?

161
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,710
Well, recall that the expected return on a stock

162
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,740
includes a risk premium that's compensation for market risk.

163
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,770
And hence, the expected return on Tesla

164
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,890
is higher than the risk-free rate.

165
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,340
By contrast, the forward price is

166
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,950
based on an expected return that's

167
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,260
equal to the risk-free rate.

168
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,330
Hence, the forward price of a stock

169
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,960
tends to give a downward-biased estimate of the future price

170
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,750
of the stock.

171
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,018
