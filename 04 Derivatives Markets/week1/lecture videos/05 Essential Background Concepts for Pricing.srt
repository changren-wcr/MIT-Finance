00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
PROFESSOR: We're almost ready to turn to pricing formulas

1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,580
and how they were derived but, first, just a little

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,100
more background information.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,040
I want you to remember that an arbitrage opportunity is

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,820
a trading strategy that either yields a positive profit today

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,830
with no future costs or that costs nothing today but yields

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,270
a positive profit in the future.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,710
In other words, a way to make free money.

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,210
The pricing formulas for forward contracts and other derivatives

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,650
are often derived using no-arbitrage arguments.

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,700
That is, their prices adjust so that no arbitrage opportunities

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,510
exist.

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,810
Price deviations might arise temporarily,

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,990
but traders try to exploit the situation

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,765
and that quickly pushes prices back in line.

15
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:53,290


16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,990
No arbitrage doesn't mean the prices are

17
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,140
right in any kind of an absolute sense

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,420
or that there's no market frictions,

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,580
it just means that relative prices

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,970
between different securities are consistent.

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,250
The absence of arbitrage leads to the famous Law of One Price.

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,010
Securities with identical future payoffs

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,560
must have the same price today.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,950
Otherwise, traders would buy low, sell high,

25
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,310
and pocket an arbitrage profit with all future cash

26
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,120
flows canceling each other out.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,420
Now, in the more realistic situation,

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,360
when there's a bid-ask spread between the price

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,880
that an asset can be bought and sold for,

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,110
we can find no-arbitrage bounds on prices rather than

31
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,910
a single no-arbitrage price.

32
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,150
For any market price that lies inside those bounds,

33
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,580
there's no arbitrage opportunity.

34
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,490
You'll be asked to derive an example of such bounds

35
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,140
in one of the homework problems.

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,200
The final ingredient we need before turning to driving

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,680
pricing formulas is the idea of short sales,

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,850
also called short selling.

39
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,220
As you know, a short position is one in which

40
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,410
a trader sells an asset.

41
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,980
There are two ways to sell short.

42
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,900
The first is to sell an asset you already own.

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,900
The second is to borrow it from someone who owns it

44
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,920
and then sell it.

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,810
The trader must later buy the asset

46
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,430
and return it to the lender.

47
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,030
The trader must also replace the value of interest or dividend

48
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,220
payments that come in while the asset is borrowed.

49
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,620
In exchange for lending the asset,

50
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,410
the lender typically receives a small fee.

51
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,380
Now, sometimes it can be difficult, or even impossible,

52
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,920
to find the desired asset to borrow in short.

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,220
When shorting becomes expensive or isn't possible,

54
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,220
derivative prices can diverge from what is predicted

55
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,510
using no-arbitrage conditions.

56
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,148
