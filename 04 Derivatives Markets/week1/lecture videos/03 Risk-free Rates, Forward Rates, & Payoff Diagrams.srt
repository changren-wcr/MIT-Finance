00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
PROFESSOR: Let's spend a few minutes reviewing

1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,860
the idea of risk-free interest rates and the yield curve,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,590
since they're central to pricing forward contracts

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,720
and other derivatives.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,370
A risk-free bond promises future payments that

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,200
are free from default risk.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,410
Its price is the present value of those promised payments.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,660
An important type of bond for our purpose

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,530
here is a zero-coupon, also called a pure discount bond,

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,350
that promises a single payment at maturity

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,690
equal to its face value.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,700
Here we call that face value capital

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,860
Z. Given the market price of a zero-coupon bond, p, its face

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,800
value, Z, the maturity date, capital T,

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,590
we can infer the risk-free interest rate, or yield,

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,410
from the formula on the slide.

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,200


17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,980
In this representation, the interest rate, r sub T,

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,680
is stated on a continuous basis.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,860
That's a common way rates are represented in derivatives

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,750
pricing formulas.

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,870
However, in other markets, such as bond markets,

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,550
yields are often stated on an annual, semiannual, monthly,

23
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,020
even daily basis.

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,150
And we'll use those alternatives in some

25
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,650
of the examples we look at.

26
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,645


27
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:25,020
Notice that if you know the price

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,910
of the bond and its promised payments

29
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,920
and its time to maturity, then you can infer the yield.

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,380
And if you know the yield, the promised payments, and the time

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,720
to maturity, you can infer the price.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,320
The price and the yield contain the same information.

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,080
In terms of the underlying economics of the situation,

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,990
you should think of the forces of supply and demand

35
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,930
determining the risk-free interest rate or the price

36
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,860
for every zero-coupon bond for every possible maturity.

37
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,980
I want to turn back and say a few more words also

38
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,580
about the Treasury spot yield curve.

39
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,340
The yield curve, which is also known

40
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,169
as the term structure of interest rates,

41
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:15,870
is the relationship between bond yields and bond maturities.

42
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,150
In practice, the risk-free yield curve

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,540
is often calculated from the market prices of US Treasury

44
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,040
securities.

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,170
Since there may be no maturing Treasury

46
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,390
security on a particular future date,

47
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,510
the spot rates for that date have to be interpolated.

48
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,730
Finally, it's important to understand

49
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,390
that bonds like Treasury bonds, whose promised cash flows are

50
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,490
free from default risk, still entail

51
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,910
significant risk for investors because the bond's market

52
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,390
price will change over time as market interest rates change.

53
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,110
Hedging bond price risk is a very popular use

54
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,780
of derivatives contracts, and in particular,

55
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,205
forwards, futures, and swaps.

56
00:02:56,205 --> 00:03:00,340


57
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,650
Forward contract prices for bonds

58
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,240
and other fixed-income securities

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,190
are closely tied to the yield curve,

60
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,650
and in particular, to the implied forward rates

61
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,550
in the yield curve.

62
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,190
We'll see why in more detail next week.

63
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,350
But for now, let's review the idea of implied forward rates.

64
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,480
We just saw that, in general, the price

65
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,680
today of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T2

66
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,450
is found by discounting the face value, Z, that's paid at T2,

67
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,065
buy the yield to maturity, r sub T2.

68
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:38,410


69
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,780
As we'll see soon, a no-arbitrage argument

70
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,120
ties down the forward price for this bond

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,910
for delivery at time T1.

72
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,350
The forward price is just the future value of the time zero

73
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,240
bond price as of T1 computed using the current yield,

74
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,275
r sub T1.

75
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:01,880


76
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:08,810
Now, substituting for the bond price into the forward price,

77
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:16,010
we can express the forward price in terms of the yields, r of T1

78
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,249
and r of T2, in the current yield curve.

79
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:24,150


80
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,480
Now let's turn to forward rates.

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,800
Implicit in forward prices are forward rates.

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,930
A forward rate is the interest rate

83
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,670
locked in a forward contract on the underlying security.

84
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,370
In this example, the forward contract

85
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,160
is for delivery of a zero-coupon bond

86
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,560
at time T1 that matures at time T2.

87
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,540
So at T1, it will have remaining life, T2 minus T1.

88
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,680


89
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,710
The implied forward rate is defined

90
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,220
as the yield that equates the present value of the cash

91
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,155
flow on the bond at T2 with the forward price paid at T1.

92
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:11,810


93
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,280
Equating our two equations for the forward price

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,360
and solving for the implied forward rate by rearranging,

95
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,470
we come up with this important formula

96
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,150
for the implied forward rate.

97
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,790


98
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,970
Contracts based on forward rates, which

99
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,600
include bond market futures contracts, short-term interest

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,300
rate contracts and interest rate swaps,

101
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,570
all are based on this fundamental formula relating

102
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,060
forward rates for any future time interval

103
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,095
to the yield curve.

104
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:50,600


105
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,830
Beyond pricing forward contracts on fixed-income securities,

106
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,010
the standard formulas used for derivative pricing

107
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,640
depend on the assumption that market participants

108
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,910
can borrow or lend at a risk-free rate,

109
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,120
or at least very close to it.

110
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,510
In practice, market participants can accomplish

111
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,480
risk-free borrowing and lending by buying and selling

112
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,400
Treasury securities or by using collateralized borrowing

113
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,190
and lending, often with repurchase agreements,

114
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,170
also known as RPs or repos.

115
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,000
