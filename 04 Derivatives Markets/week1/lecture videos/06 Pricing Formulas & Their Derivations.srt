1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,500
PROFESSOR: We're now going to put the idea of no arbitrage

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,830
to work to drive pricing formulas for many of the most

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,530
popular forward contracts.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,220
In general, forwards for what are called pure investment

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,700
assets, like stocks, bonds, and currencies,

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,880
can be priced using no arbitrage arguments.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,660
For instance, we'll return to Example 2.1

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,480
on forward currency contracts and see

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,060
where the forward price of $1.28 per euro came from.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,030
Specifically, we'll derive formulas

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,780
by considering a so-called cash and carry strategy

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,750
that will generate arbitrage profits for traders

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,840
if forward prices differ from their theoretical values.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,320


15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,570
While simple cash and carry logic

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,160
ties down the forward prices for pure investment assets,

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,060
pricing is more complicated for non-investment assets,

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,629
such as agricultural products, energy, and metals.

19
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,640
We will also look at the determinants

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,880
of those forward prices and common formulas used

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,780
to price them.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,760


23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,940
This very important slide shows the pricing formulas

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,930
for the forward prices of stocks, bonds, and currencies.

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,600
You'll find it useful in answering some of the homework

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,210
questions for this week.

27
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,500
There are several similarities between all of these formulas.

28
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,080
First, the forward price always depends

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,240
on the current spot price of the underlying asset,

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:49,510
for stocks, for bonds, and for currencies.

31
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,990
Second, it involves a future value factor

32
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,120
based on the risk-free interest rate

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,590
and on the maturity equal to the time to the contract

34
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,350
expiration.

35
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:12,320


36
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,620
Third, there's an adjustment for any cash flows

37
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,470
that arrive between the time the contract is

38
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,560
written at time zero and the contract expiration date.

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,460
In the case of stocks, those cash flows are dividends.

40
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,250


41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,740
For bonds or loans, the cash flows

42
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,810
are coupons or interest payments.

43
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,390
And for currencies, the cash flow

44
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,140
is the interest income from investing in a risk-free bond.

45
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,830


46
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,500
With regard to these cash flow adjustments,

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,140
the formulas differ slightly, depending

48
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,030
on whether the payment is assumed

49
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,940
to be continuous or discrete.

50
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,970
A continuous flow is the natural assumption, for example,

51
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,320
in the case of the dividend yield on the S&P 500 stock

52
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,070
price index.

53
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,210
However, if the underlying is an individual stock,

54
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,360
dividend payments are more realistically modeled

55
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
as the discrete flow at a known future point in time.

56
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,980


57
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,990
Let's look at an example of how these formulas can be applied.

58
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,450
Remember Example 2.1, where we looked

59
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,590
at a US firm that wanted to hedge its exposure to exchange

60
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,460
rate risk arising from a receivable of 5 million euros

61
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,670
that would be arriving in six months.

62
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,660
In that example, we assume that the spot exchange rate

63
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,050
is $1.2673 per euro currently.

64
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,870
Remember that the unhedged dollar payoff

65
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,900
will depend on the exchange rate in six months

66
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,950
and equals 5 million euros times whatever that exchange

67
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,100
rate turns out to be.

68
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,930
Let's also assume that we know that the current six-month US

69
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,840
dollar risk-free free interest rate is 5%

70
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,140
and that the current six-month euro risk-free interest

71
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,600
rate is 3%.

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,570


73
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,840
Recall that to hedge the risk that the dollar would

74
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,460
strengthen against the euro, the firm entered into a contract

75
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,520
to sell euros forward in exchange for the dollars.

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,490
We assumed that the forward rate was

77
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,620
$1.28 per euro, which implied that the firm could lock

78
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,920
in a certain dollar payment which we calculated to be

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,665
$6.4 million in six months.

80
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,480


81
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,960
Using the formula for currency forwards

82
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,690
and plugging in this information, that

83
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:08,790
is the current spot exchange rate was $1.2673,

84
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:17,320
the dollar interest rate was 5%, the euro interest rate was 3%,

85
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,100
and the time horizon is six months,

86
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,790
you can verify that the implied forward exchange

87
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:32,580
rate is $1.28 per euro.

88
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,770
I showed you formulas for the forward prices of stocks,

89
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,060
bonds, and currencies that all depend on current spot

90
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,910
prices, risk-free interest rates,

91
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,070
any cash flows on the underlying assets

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,740
over the life of the contract, and the time

93
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,760
until contract expiration.

94
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,040
Where do these similarities come from?

95
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,860
The answer is they come from the cash

96
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,570
and carry strategy that leads to a no arbitrage condition.

97
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,110
That strategy is similar in all three cases,

98
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,050
and we'll go through one example here in detail.

99
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,220
Specifically, let's consider a trading strategy

100
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,550
involving a short forward position in one share

101
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,770
of a non-dividend-paying stock.

102
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,920
As usual, we'll call the contract expiration date

103
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,890
capital T. We'll start with the multiple transactions at time

104
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,180
zero.

105
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,150
First, enter into a short forward position.

106
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,660
Remember that this requires no upfront payment.

107
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,270


108
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,020
It locks in an obligation to deliver a share of stock

109
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,590
at a time, capital T, in return for the forward price,

110
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,980
capital F. Now also at time zero,

111
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,510
you're going to buy the stock at its current spot price, P sub

112
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,020
S.

113
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,830
Importantly, we're going to pay for that purchase with borrowed

114
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,110
money.

115
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,920
Because you've bought the stock with borrowed money

116
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,450
and also the forward contract involves no initial payment,

117
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,790
the net cash flow at time zero is certainly equal to zero.

118
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,770


119
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,430
Now, let's unwind the position at the contract expiration

120
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,080
date, cap T. You receive the forward price

121
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,700
in the forward contract and deliver the share of stock.

122
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,030
You also have to repay the money you borrowed with interest.

123
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,250


124
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,420
You're going to use the stock that you bought to deliver

125
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,830
into the forward contract.

126
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,610


127
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,630
The net time, T, cash flow then is the difference

128
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,060
between the forward price received

129
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,695
in the forward contract and the money repaid on the loan.

130
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:07,510


131
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,310
Notice that all of these outcomes

132
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,040
involve no uncertainty.

133
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,010
Now, we can appeal to the no arbitrage idea that a trading

134
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,090
strategy that costs nothing to enter into cannot generate

135
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,580
a positive profit in the future.

136
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,400
Hence, we can conclude that the forward price

137
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,340
has to be less than or equal to the loan repayment amount.

138
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,179


139
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,309
We can finish nailing down the forward price

140
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:37,220
by considering a similar set of transactions

141
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,850
but this time involving a long position in a forward contract

142
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,830
on that same stock.

143
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,230
This is called a reverse cash and carry.

144
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,890
At time zero, enter into a long forward position.

145
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,150
At the same time, short the stock at its current spot

146
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,400
price.

147
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,820
Also, lend the amount received from that short sale

148
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,190
of the stock at the risk-free rate.

149
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,130
Because you've sold the stock and lent out the money

150
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,580
you received and because the forward contract involves

151
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,180
no initial payment, the net cash flow at time zero

152
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,430
is identically zero.

153
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,730
Now, let's unwind the position at the contract expiration

154
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,720
date, cap T. You pay the forward price, F,

155
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,290
and you receive the stock in the forward transaction.

156
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,770
You use the stock you receive in the contract

157
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,300
to cover your short position that you took a time zero.

158
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,950
That is you return the stock that you borrowed.

159
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,850
You also receive the money that you lent out,

160
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,170
plus the accumulated interest payment.

161
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,840
The net time, cap T, cash flow is the difference

162
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,860
between the loan repayment and the forward price you paid out.

163
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,770
Notice that all of these values are certain.

164
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,680
Let's again apply no arbitrage logic.

165
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,250
The time zero cash flow is zero, so there

166
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,380
can be no future profit.

167
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,360
We can conclude that the forward price

168
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,945
has to be greater than or equal to the loan repayment amount.

169
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:18,460


170
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,360
Putting together the conclusions of the cash and carry

171
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,580
and the reverse cash and carry logic,

172
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,650
we can conclude that the forward price

173
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,200
for a non-dividend-paying stock must

174
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,450
be exactly equal to the future value of its spot price.

175
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,020
For stocks that pay a dividend, or for coupon bonds,

176
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,990
similar logic holds, but adjustments

177
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,860
must be made for the cash flows from dividends or coupons

178
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,040
over the life of the contract.

179
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,240
The general intuition there is that because a dividend

180
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,670
or a coupon payment reduces the remaining

181
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:58,320
value of an asset's cash flows, it reduces its forward price.
