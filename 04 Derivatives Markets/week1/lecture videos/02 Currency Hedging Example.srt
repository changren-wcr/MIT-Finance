00:00:00,926 --> 00:00:04,210
INSTRUCTOR: Let's look at an example of how forward currency

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,360
contracts are often used to hedge against exchange rate

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,100
risk.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,730
Imagine that a US firm has sold a piece of equipment

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,980
to a German client, and the firm has

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,710
agreed to accept the payment of 5 million euros

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,060
to be paid in six months.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,040
At time t when the agreement is made,

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,490
the exchange rate is $1.2673 USD per euro.

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,530
What's the risk for the US firm?

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,960
Well, clearly, there's exchange rate risk

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,820
because over the next six months,

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,240
euros could depreciate relative to the dollar.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,480
The unhedged dollar value of the payment in six months

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,500
will be 5 million euros times whatever the exchange

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,140
rate turns out to be in six months, which

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,130
is a random variable.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,380


19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,210
To hedge this exposure, the firm can

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,220
enter into a forward contract with a bank

21
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,090
to sell the euros forward.

22
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,670
In that contract, say that the firm

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,690
agrees to deliver 5 million euros in six months in exchange

24
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,210
for dollars at a pre-specified exchange

25
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,650
rate of $1.28 per euro.

26
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,430
That position can be described as the firm being short

27
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,210
the euro forward.

28
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,030
At the expiration date in six months,

29
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,490
the profit or loss on the forward contract

30
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,420
with the bank in dollars is $5 million times

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,140
the forward rate locked in minus the spot exchange rate

32
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,255
in six months of dollars per euros.

33
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:37,070


34
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,530
The firm also receives the 5 million

35
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,260
euro payment from its client, which

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,880
has dollar value of 5 million euros multiplied by the spot

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,520
exchange rate in six months.

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,130
Putting the two transactions together,

39
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,450
the effect of the spot exchange rate in six months cancels out,

40
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,320
and the firm has locked in a dollar payment of $6.4 million

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:09,270
based on the forward rate of 1.28.

42
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,300
This is a good example for reviewing payoff diagrams,

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,460
which are often used as a tool to understand

44
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,200
the full range of possible outcomes

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,440
from decisions that involve a combination of derivatives

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,020
and other investments whose payoff also depends

47
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,020
on the value of a common underlying asset.

48
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,260
In a payoff diagram, the x-axis is a variable

49
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,840
that represents the value of the underlying asset

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,980
at some future point in time.

51
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,260
In this example, it represents the future spot exchange rate

52
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,740
of dollars per euro in six months.

53
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,850
The y-axis on a payoff diagram is the profit or loss

54
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,640
from a position or combination of positions

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,300
represented on the diagram.

56
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,080
The payoff here is denominated in dollars.

57
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,780
So the top diagram describes the original exposure,

58
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,710
which is based on the value of the receivable of 5

59
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,470
million euros in six months in dollar terms.

60
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,080
If euros are worthless at that time,

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,720
then the payoff will be 0.

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,070
As the exchange rate rises, the dollar payoff

63
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,140
rises linearly with it.

64
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,740


65
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,280
Now let's turn to the payoff on this short forward position

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,250
in euros.

67
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,430
From the formula we have for profit or loss,

68
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,720
at a spot exchange rate of $1.28 per euro,

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,260
the forward rate we assumed was set in the contract,

70
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,415
the payoff will be 0.

71
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:51,330


72
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,660
For spot exchange rates above 1.28,

73
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,960
the forward contract entails a loss and vice

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:07,100
versa for spot exchange rates below 1.28.

75
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,460
For a position that has multiple components that all depend

76
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,860
on the same underlying variable, we

77
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,040
can always find the net payoff by vertically

78
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,240
adding the component payoffs on a payoff diagram.

79
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,330
In this case, adding together the payoffs

80
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,420
on the original exposure with the payoffs

81
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,590
on the forward contract at each point on the x-axis

82
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,620
generates the net payoff illustrated

83
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,765
in the hedged position diagram.

84
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:43,780


85
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,030
The forward contract gains or losses

86
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,320
exactly offset the losses or gains on the original exposure,

87
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,600
leaving the firm with a certain dollar payoff of $6.4 million

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,065
that we calculated algebraically on the previous slide.

89
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,760


90
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,150
Well, you might wonder what could go wrong here.

91
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,480
Is this payoff really 100% safe?

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,990
The answer is that it is as long as all of the contracts

93
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,390
are actually honored.

94
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,730
However, if the German client defaults,

95
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,560
the firm is still obligated to make good

96
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,060
on its forward contract.

97
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,770
And it would lose money on the forward contract

98
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,320
if the dollar were to appreciate.

99
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,360
In general, it's impossible to know

100
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,060
when someone entering a forward contract

101
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,220
or some other derivative position

102
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,160
is hedging or speculating without having

103
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,170
some additional information.

104
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,410
A derivatives position functions as a hedge

105
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,200
when it offsets the risk of another position

106
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,100
in an investor's portfolio, as when the exporter here

107
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,336
was going to be long euros from the sale of the goods.

108
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:59,040
It's speculation when there's no offsetting exposure.

109
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,550
Speculators serve an important function in derivatives markets

110
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,830
by helping to make it possible for hedgers

111
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,190
to protect themselves even when there aren't enough

112
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,860
other hedgers with an opposite exposure

113
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,870
to take the other sides of the contract.

114
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,420
The diagram shown here is again the payoff

115
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,940
on a short forward contract in euros.

116
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,480
Taken alone, it represents a speculative bet

117
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,070
that the value of euro will fall against the dollar.

118
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,560
As we'll see next, this is effectively

119
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,320
the short side of a highly-levered position

120
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,500
in euros.

121
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,000
