00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,090
PROFESSOR: Hello everyone, and welcome to the first recitation

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,550
of 15.435x.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,730
My name is JR Scott, and I'm a PhD candidate

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,570
in finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,149
I'll be writing the recitations for this course.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,160
In our first recitation, we'll be

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,740
reviewing some of the mechanics of forward contracts.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,410
Without further ado, let's begin the recitation.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,560
The recitation consists of three practice problems.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,380
Problems will roughly increase in order of difficulty,

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,230
and I hope with each problem you gain a better understanding

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,040
of how forward contracts work.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,550
In the first problem, it's stated that Southern California

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,930
Edison or SCE, will need to buy 200,000 barrels of oil

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,980
in 10 days, and it is worried about fuel costs rising.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,300
Suppose SCE goes long 200 oil forward contracts of the April

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,080
contract --

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,670
it is currently March --

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,510
each for 1,000 barrels of oil at the current forward price

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,520
of $50 per barrel.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,800
Suppose forward prices change each day

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,690
as follows in the table below.

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,500
In Part A, we are asked what is the mark-to-market profit

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,450
or loss in dollars the SCE will have on each state?

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,960
To me, the best way to begin is to define some notation.

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,300
So let's define F sub T to be the forward price for day T

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,760
and, N to be the number of barrels of oil

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,240
in each forward contract.

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,060
Thus the mark-to-market profit or loss,

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,960
P/L on each forward contract on date T

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,060
is equal to N times the difference between FT and FT

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,300
minus 1, where FT minus 1 is the forward price

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,300
on the previous day for a long position.

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:54,150
And N times FT minus 1 minus FT for short position.

35
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,570
Now armed with that notation, and letting F sub 0

36
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,960
to be the current forward price of $50,

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,570
since SCE has a long position in 204 contracts with a size of N

38
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,360
equals 1,000 barrels for each contract.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,050
We can define SCE's profit or loss on day one

40
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,050
to be 200 times N times the difference between F1 and F0,

41
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,990
which, after plugging in values, equals

42
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,900
200 times 1,000 times 49.75 minus 50,

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,470
which is equal to negative $50,000.

44
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,100
In other words SCE makes a mark-to-market loss

45
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,230
of $50,000 on day one.

46
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,100
Similarly on day two, SCE's profit or loss

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,500
is 200 times N times F2 minus F1,

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,000
which, using the values for F2 and F1 from the initial table,

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,440
is equal to 200 times 1,000 times 47.25 minus 49.75,

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,840
which is equal to negative $500,000.

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,680
Thus we can iterate the above calculation for days 3

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,550
through 10 just substituting in the appropriate forward prices

53
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,480
into the formula and we can calculate SCE's daily profit

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,270
or loss, which is displayed in the table below.

55
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:29,700
Part B asks what is SCE's total profit or loss after 10 days?

56
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,440
What we're called at SCE's profit

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,740
or loss on its long position in each forward contract

58
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,110
on the first day, is equal to N times F1 minus F0,

59
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,580
and on the second day is equal to N times F2 minus F1.

60
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,690
If we sum these two quantities, we see SCE's profit or loss

61
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,390
after two days, is equal to N times F2 minus F0.

62
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,070


63
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,550
If we iterate this logic forward all the way to day 10,

64
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,570
we see that SCE's profit or loss on each forward contract

65
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,380
after 10 days, is given by N times

66
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,930
the forward price of day 10, minus

67
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,170
the initial forward price, which is F0.

68
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,390
Thus SCE's total profit or loss on its long position in 204

69
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:28,070
contracts after 10 days is, 200 times N times F10 minus F0,

70
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,910
which is equal to 200 times 1,000 times the difference

71
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:40,310
between 52.50 and 50, which is $500,000.

72
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,120
In the last part of problem one, Part C, we are asked,

73
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,517
explain why this may not be a perfect hedge for SCE.

74
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:51,100
Now I can think of a couple of reasons

75
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,440
why the strategy may not be a perfect hedge,

76
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,560
and I encourage you to think of some others on your own.

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,470
The first one is that the interest earned on the margin

78
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,230
account was not included in the calculations

79
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,590
that we did and will actually affect SCE's payoff.

80
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,620
The second one -- and this sounds pretty obvious --

81
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,080
is that not all oil is the same.

82
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,170
Oil prices differ based on quality and location,

83
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,990
so that the reference price in this forward contract

84
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,710
may not be perfectly correlated with the cash purchase price

85
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,500
that Southern California Edison faces.

86
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,000
