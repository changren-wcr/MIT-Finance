00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920


1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,850
PROFESSOR: OK.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,970
Now, let's move on to the second problem of the recitation.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,790
Problem 2 states that a stock is expected

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,000
to pay a dividend of $1 per share in two months

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,220
and also in five months.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,670
The stock price is currently $50 and the risk-free rate

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,840
of interest is 8% per annum with continuous compounding

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,580
for all maturities.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,160
An investor has just taken a short position

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,250
in a six month forward contract on the stock.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,700
In the first part of the question,

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,150
we are asked what are the forward price

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,235
and the initial value of the forward contract?

14
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:40,630


15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,670
The easiest way to solve this problem

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,530
is to break it down into three steps.

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,370
In step one, we'll use a given risk-free rate

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,740
to find the present value of the stocks expected dividends.

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,240
First, the notation.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,840
Let lowercase t denote the time in years and r

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,780
be the continuously compounded constant risk-free rate

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,670
expressed as a decimal.

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,319
As we saw in Professor Lucas's first lecture,

24
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,850
we can discount any cash flow arriving at time t

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,900
back to the present using the expression PV equals

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,170
D times the exponential of negative r times

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,190
t on a continuous basis, where D is the cash flow,

28
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,595
in this case in dollars, and PV is its present value.

29
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:26,350


30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,070
Deploying that definition, we can find the present value

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,530
of the $1 dividends that we expect

32
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,630
to receive in both 2 and 5 months

33
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:42,760
as I, which equals 1 times the exponential of negative 0.08

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,640
for the 8% risk-free rate times 2/12 for the two month dividend

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,470
plus 1 times the exponential of negative 0.08

36
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,840
times 5/12 for the five month dividend,

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,430
which is roughly equal to $1.95.

38
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,190
In step two, we can find the forward price

39
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,639
of the stock using the equation we learned in Professor Lucas's

40
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,320
first lecture.

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,510
Recall from Professor Lucas's lecture

42
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,790
that we can calculate the forward price of a stock

43
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:23,250
as F0 equals PS0 minus I times the exponential of r times t,

44
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,430
where F0 is the initial forward price,

45
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,390
P sub S0 is the current price of the stock and t

46
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,360
is the time to the maturity of the forward contract measured

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,950
in years.

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:41,880
Plugging in, PS0 equals $50, I equals $1.95,

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,630
and t equals 0.5 for six months.

50
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,600
We get that the forward price is F0

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,710
equals 50 minus 1.954 times e to the 0.08 times

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:02,850
0.5, which equals $50.01.

53
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,790
Finally, in step three, we can find

54
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,890
the initial value of the short position

55
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,850
in the forward contract.

56
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,610
This is not so hard, really.

57
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,860
As Professor Lucas discussed in lecture,

58
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,190
in the absence of arbitrage, all forward contracts

59
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,100
must have a net present value of 0 at inception.

60
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,020
Now, why is this the case?

61
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,170
Well, let P sub S0 will be the current price

62
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,110
of the stock that's underlying the forward contract.

63
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,110
The cash flows from a short forward position

64
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,680
are equivalent to those obtained by simultaneously lending

65
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,780
negative P sub S0 dollars today and shorting the stock at P sub

66
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,490
S0.

67
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,180
Clearly, the net cash flow today from this so-called Reverse

68
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,760
Cash-and-Carry strategy is 0.

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,880
So by the Law of One Price, the net present value

70
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,240
of the short position in the forward contract is also 0.

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,860


72
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,440
In Part B, it's three months later.

73
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,020
The price of the stock is now $48

74
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,410
and the risk-free rate is still 8% per annum.

75
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,200
What are the forward price and the value of the short position

76
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,240
in the forward contract now?

77
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,740
Well just like in Part A, we can go through our three steps.

78
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,339
Recall that in step one, we can use the given risk-free rate

79
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:23,580
to find the present value of the stock's expected dividends.

80
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,970
Since we originally expected to receive $1 dividends

81
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,960
in 2 and 5 months, now that it's three months later,

82
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,230
we can expect to receive a single dividend in two months.

83
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,370
The risk-free rate is still 8%, so the present value

84
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,560
of this dividend is I, which equals 1 times the exponential

85
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,850
of negative 0.08 times 2/12, which

86
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,220
is roughly equal to $0.98.

87
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,890
Now in step two, we can find the forward price

88
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,010
of the stock using the equation we learned in Professor Lucas's

89
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,820
first lecture.

90
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,200
Suppose F sub lowercase t is the forward price

91
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,710
for a contract negotiated at time lowercase t measured

92
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,060
in years, P sub S lowercase t is the stock price

93
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,300
at time lowercase t, and capital T

94
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,960
is the time to maturity of the contract also denominated

95
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,340
in years.

96
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,640
In this general form, our equation for the forward price

97
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,690
of a stock is now F sub lowercase t equals

98
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:33,060
P sub S lowercase t minus I times the exponential of r

99
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:40,290
times uppercase T. Plugging in P sub S lowercase t equals $48,

100
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:46,380
I equals roughly $0.98, and capital T equals 0.25,

101
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,570
we can find the forward price of the stock

102
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:55,350
three months later to be 48 minus 0.9868 times

103
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,040
the exponential of 0.8 times 3/12

104
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:06,130
for three months, which is equal to $47.96.

105
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,260
In our third and final step, we can

106
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,300
find the value of the short position

107
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,890
in the forward contract.

108
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,330
Now, we can't use the trick from the first part of the question

109
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,510
since we're no longer at the initiation of the contract

110
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,060
but from Professor Lucas's lecture, we

111
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,800
saw that the value of a short position

112
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,830
in any forward contract at time lowercase t

113
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,660
is given by lowercase f sub lowercase t,

114
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,470
which is equal to capital F0 minus capital F sub

115
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,920
t times the exponential of negative r

116
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,570
times the difference between capital T and lowercase t.

117
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,390
Thus, we can find the value of a short position

118
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,270
in the forward contract three months later by plugging

119
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,280
in capital F sub 0 equals $50.01,

120
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,260
capital F sub 0.25, which we just found in step 2,

121
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,900
equals $47.96, capital T equals 0.5

122
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,120
for a maturity of six months, and lowercase t equals 0.25

123
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,420
since we're three months into the contract, into the equation

124
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,760
above, which gives us an answer of $2.01.

125
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,000
