00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:03,680
PROFESSOR: In our third and final question,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,390
we have the following setup.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,520
A company enters into a forward contract

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,440
with a bank to sell a foreign currency for K sub 1 at a time

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,220
T sub 1.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,110
The exchange rate at time T sub 1

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,230
proves to be greater than K sub 1.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,510
And let's call that exchange rate S sub 1.

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,270
The company asks the bank if it can roll the contract forward

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,220
until time T2 rather than settle at time T sub 1.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,760
The bank agrees to a new delivery price K2.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,500
Explain how K2 should be calculated.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,590
Now, we have a lot of letters and numbers

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,890
floating around here.

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,410
So let's get some convention right at the beginning.

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,200
As a convention, let's assume that the exchange rate

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,340
is quoted as a number of units of domestic currency per unit

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,060
of foreign currency.

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,070
So if the exchange rate goes up, then the foreign currency

20
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,220
has appreciated, that is its price

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,459
in terms of the domestic currency has increased.

22
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,480
Also, note that the bank has a long position

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,230
in the forward contract and hence

24
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,125
has agreed to buy the foreign currency in the future.

25
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,680


26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,710
First, let's find the value of the forward contract

27
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,320
to the bank at time T1.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,990
Since the spot exchange rate S1 at T1

29
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,870
is greater than the forward exchange rate K1,

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,090
the bank can purchase the foreign currency

31
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,640
at a lower price using the forward contract

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,980
than it can on the spot market.

33
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,550
Thus, the value of the foreign contract to the bank

34
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,520
is equal to the cost savings from purchasing

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,730
the foreign currency with the foreign contract, which

36
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,300
is S1 minus K1.

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,720
Now, how will the bank optimally choose the new delivery price

38
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,090
K2 at T2?

39
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,540
Well, to be as well off as before, the bank requires

40
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,830
the value of this new rolled forward contract at T1

41
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,740
to be equal to S1 minus K1.

42
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,340
This implies that S1 times the exponential

43
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,630
of negative Rf, where Rf is the foreign risk-free rate,

44
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:17,110
times T2 minus T1 minus K2 times the exponential of negative R,

45
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,720
where R is the domestic risk-free rate,

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,700
times T2 minus T1 is equal to S1 minus K1, where

47
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,400
both the risk-free rates, domestic and foreign,

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,730
are observed at T1 and applicable to the period

49
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,380
between T1 and T2.

50
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,920


51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,100
Now, let's stare at that equation a little bit more.

52
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,880
The first term on the left-hand side,

53
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,530
S1 times the exponential of negative Rf times T2 minus T1,

54
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,950
is the present value of investing S1 units

55
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,240
the foreign currency at the foreign risk-free rate of Rf

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,850
from T1 to T2.

57
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,980
The second term on the left-hand side,

58
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,530
K2 times the exponential of negative R times T2 minus T1,

59
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,490
is the present value of investing

60
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,280
K2 units of the foreign currency at the domestic risk-free rate

61
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,560
of R from T1 to T2.

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,220
If we solve for K, we see that K2

63
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,300
is equal to S1 minus the exponential of the difference

64
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,620
between the domestic and the foreign risk-free rate and T2

65
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,770
minus T1 minus S1 minus K1 times the exponential

66
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,540
of the domestic risk-free rate times T2 minus T1.

67
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,410
So what does all this mean?

68
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,660
Well, what this means is that there are two components to K2.

69
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,680
The first is the forward price at time T1.

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,320
And the second one is an adjustment

71
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,320
to the forward price that is equal to the bank's

72
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,400
gain on the first part of the contract compounded forward

73
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,640
at the domestic risk-free rate.

74
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,130
Now that concludes our first recitation for 15.435x.

75
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,510
I look forward to seeing all of you next week.
