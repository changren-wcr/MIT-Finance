1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,910
PROFESSOR: Now let's turn to how derivatives are traded.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,119
Standalone derivatives are traded in two forms:

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:14,030
on exchanges and in the over-the-counter or OTC market.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,640
Exchanges provide a central location,

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,970
either physical or electronic, where people come together

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,220
to buy or sell standardized contracts.

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,340
The over-the-counter market refers to bilateral trades that

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,430
usually are made between large financial firms, offering

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,190
derivatives, and the customers of those firms,

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,770
which themselves, are often other financial firms.

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,830
The OTC market is now the larger of the two.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,810
But exchanges provide important benefits,

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,910
including more transparent price discovery and greater safety

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,470
from default risk.

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,440
A recent trend is towards convergence between the two

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,790
types of markets.

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,860
For example, collateral now is often required in OTC markets,

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,350
just as it always has been for exchange-traded instruments.

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,890
Regulators worldwide are forcing some OTC derivatives

20
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,960
to be settled through clearinghouses,

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,720
like those used by exchanges.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,890
Clearing reduces the size of gross risk exposures, which

23
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,350
reduces the sort of systemic risk

24
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,980
that contributed to the global financial crisis of 2008.

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,300
Say, for example, Bob sells Miriam 10 futures

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,890
contracts and Miriam sells Bob seven of the same futures

27
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,660
contracts.

28
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,550
Clearing results in Bob having an obligation based on selling

29
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,070
three contracts to Miriam.

30
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,140
Without clearing, there would have

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:54,520
been more risk exposure with the 17 outstanding contracts.

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,550
It appears the derivatives may have been around for just about

33
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,400
as long as civilization itself.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,460
They arise when a significant commercial or investment

35
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,460
risk creates a demand for insuring against that risk.

36
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,934
This slide highlights some interesting historical examples

37
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:11,290
--

38
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,020
from evidence showing that foreign contracts were

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,740
used in 2000 BCE in trade between India

40
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,830
and the Arab Gulf to ancient Greece where,

41
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,820
at least as far back as 300 BC, olive growers

42
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,790
use derivatives to reduce price risks associated

43
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,040
with future harvests, and to the famous Amsterdam tulip mania

44
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,690
in the 1630s where these financial instruments helped

45
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,360
protect at least some of the merchants

46
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,330
from the large price swings.

47
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,910
The exchanges that play such an important role

48
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,060
in today's derivatives markets got their start in Chicago

49
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,950
in the mid 1800s.

50
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,240
Since that time, there have been many changes and innovations,

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,750
including the addition of many new types of contracts

52
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,120
and the opening of new exchanges,

53
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,130
both in the United States and internationally.

54
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,240
The way trade is conducted on the exchanges has also changed

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,100
dramatically --

56
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,180
from open outcry with traders on the trading floor

57
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,500
shouting out their buy and sell orders to most trades today

58
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,330
taking place electronically via the computers of trading firms

59
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,730
located all over the world.

60
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,810
Not only has the physical process of trading gone

61
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,960
high tech, but the analytical innovations

62
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,420
in valuing derivatives, which are

63
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,210
one of the major focuses of this class,

64
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,290
have transformed the business of derivatives trading.

65
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,270
It's also worth you're knowing a little bit

66
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,850
about the growth of the derivatives markets

67
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,010
and the drivers of that growth.

68
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,980
For most of the last 50 years, the notional size

69
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,840
of the international derivatives market

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,960
has been growing exponentially, reaching an astronomical $700

71
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,080
trillion around the time of the global financial crisis

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,620
in 2008.

73
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,230
Since then, the market has remained enormous,

74
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,470
but growth has slowed down or even reversed.

75
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,500
That slowdown shouldn't be interpreted

76
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,290
as a falloff in the use of derivative contracts,

77
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,140
although some derivatives markets were slow to come back

78
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,450
after the crisis.

79
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,660
The main reason for the reduction in notional principal

80
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,990
has been the increased use of cleared contracts

81
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,680
and the related phenomenon of compression.

82
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,860
Recall our example of Bob and Miriam,

83
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,790
who would have created 17 futures contracts between them

84
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,910
without clearing, but with clearing, only

85
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,450
have three contracts because of the offsetting positions

86
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,130
that have canceled out.

87
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,630
What caused these markets to take off?

88
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,730
Commentators have pointed to a combination

89
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,160
of factors that include deregulation,

90
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,310
increased price volatility in important markets,

91
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,770
and technological innovation.

92
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,680
Deregulation contributed to price volatility,

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,100
for instance, when international agreements allowed exchange

94
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,870
rates between major currencies to float starting in 1971

95
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,200
or when natural gas prices were deregulated in the United

96
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,870
States in 1978.

97
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,070
OPEC policies caused oil prices to become very volatile

98
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,770
starting in the 1970s.

99
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,670
Technological progress, both in derivatives pricing

100
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,720
and in information technology, increased market efficiency

101
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,950
and access, which in turn, made the derivatives markets more

102
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,940
attractive.

103
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,800


104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,160
The increases in price volatility were quite dramatic.

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,840
For example, as shown in these graphs,

106
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,590
there were a few changes in the price of oil and the 25 years

107
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,440
prior to 1973.

108
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,350
And the dollar-pound exchange rate

109
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,790
was almost constant prior to the late 1970s

110
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,930
when it was allowed to float.

111
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,080
As I mentioned earlier, there are now many derivatives

112
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,400
exchanges around the world.

113
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,160
However, much of the trading volume

114
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,520
remains concentrated in a small number of exchanges that are

115
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,910
domiciled in the United States.

116
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,930
The so-called open interest, reported in this table,

117
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,350
is the notional principle of all the outstanding futures

118
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,550
contracts, or options contracts in these different markets.

119
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,430
The daily average turnover is the dollar volume

120
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,450
of contracts traded.

121
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,730
One reason the trading is concentrated

122
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,100
on a small number of exchanges is

123
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,920
that liquidity is enhanced if more people are

124
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,710
trading in the same contract.

125
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,980
By choosing to trade on the exchange that has the highest

126
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,960
trading volumes, traders expect to obtain the best prices.

127
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,110
They can also take advantage of collateral offsets.

128
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,490
That makes its changes examples of natural monopolies,

129
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,460
where there's an economic advantage to concentrating

130
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,890
activity in a single firm.

131
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,620
Those efficiencies from centralization

132
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,930
make it difficult for new exchanges

133
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,330
to compete with established venues.

134
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,590


135
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,190
Derivatives' market participants can be divided into three broad

136
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,440
and non-exclusive categories--

137
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,290
end users, intermediaries, and financial engineers.

138
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,200
End users like corporation, use derivatives

139
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,540
to manage the risk exposures that

140
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,960
arise from the cost of inputs into production

141
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,030
or the demand for their products.

142
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,090
Financial institutions like banks,

143
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,400
manage their large interest rates,

144
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,670
currency, and credit risk exposures

145
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,040
that arise from the services they provide,

146
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,520
and from mismatches between the assets and liabilities

147
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,890
on their balance sheets.

148
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,740
Hedge funds used derivatives to take highly leveraged

149
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,850
positions, as do some individual traders, that

150
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,735
wish to make financial bets on particular economic outcomes.

151
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,770


152
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,580
Intermediaries, also called market makers,

153
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,280
help end users satisfy their demand for derivative products.

154
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,539
For example, dealers post buy and sell prices, also known

155
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,200
as bid and ask prices, for the derivatives contracts

156
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,370
that they make a market in.

157
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,280
They seek to make money from the difference between the bid

158
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,570
and ask prices.

159
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,840
The inventories the dealers wind up temporarily holding

160
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,630
expose them to unwanted risks.

161
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,110
When they manage those exposures using derivatives,

162
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,040
the intermediaries themselves become end users.

163
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,040
We'll work through an example of a dealer's risk management

164
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,770
problem and how it can be solved with derivatives

165
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,900
later in the class.

166
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,030
As we've seen, the markets for derivatives

167
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,570
continue to rapidly evolve with a steady flow of new product,

168
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,850
strategies, and technologies.

169
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,600
Those developments are often the work of financial engineers,

170
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,500
whose job it is to translate customers' risk management

171
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,740
challenges into new tools and customized products

172
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,170
and strategies that can help them

173
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,155
address the issues effectively and at as low

174
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:40,140
a cost as possible.

175
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,660
Financial engineering also allows

176
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,840
complex financial positions and transactions

177
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,350
to be understood in terms of equivalent derivative

178
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,590
positions, and to be accurately valued and understood as such.

179
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,180
