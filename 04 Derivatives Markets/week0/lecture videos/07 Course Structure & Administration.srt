PROFESSOR: In this video, I would

1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,110
like to talk more specifically about the structure

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,790
of this course.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,800
It is an instructor-paced course and we

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,260
will be releasing content each Wednesday

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,030
at 15:00 hours Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,750
We highly recommend that you subscribe to weekly emails

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,460
from the course team.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,080
We use these emails to communicate

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,200
important information and these are the most efficient way

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,870
of staying up to date on important course information.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,320
Please go to your dashboard and check your email settings

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,850
for this course.

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,250
Make sure to check the box to receive course emails.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,060
Each week's content will have three components: lectures,

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,720
recitations, and problem sets.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,760
Lecture videos deliver the main content

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,030
and introduce you to major concepts.

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,660
Lectures are accompanied by concept checks that

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,180
are designed to help you understand the material

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,090
of each learning module.

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,600
Recitations are designed to bridge the gap between lectures

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,610
and problem sets.

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,310
The recitation content will help you understand and apply

24
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,200
the relevant lecture concepts and will

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,730
help you solidify your understanding of the material.

26
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,040
Problem sets in this course are due each Wednesday

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,020
at 15:00 hours UTC.

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,740
You have exactly one week to finish problem sets.

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,950
As a matter of policy, homework deadlines will not be extended.

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,980
We do recognize, however, that circumstances

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,790
can arise that prevent you from meeting every single deadline,

32
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,460
and want to offer some flexibility.

33
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,060
Therefore, we will drop your lowest homework score

34
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,430
at the end of the course.

35
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,540
This course culminates with a two hour final exam.

36
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,510
This exam is a required assessment

37
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,820
for verified learners in this course.

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,980
And verified learners must take it

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,060
in order to be eligible for a course certificate.

40
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,780
The exam has to be taken within a specified window of time.

41
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,740
Please see the course schedule for details.

42
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,610
We're not able to accommodate exams outside of this window.

43
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,300
And therefore, we ask you to plan accordingly.

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,010
We would like to emphasize the importance

45
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,740
of working diligently and consistently

46
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,390
throughout the course.

47
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,220
Do not fall behind.

48
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,660
Content is cumulative.

49
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,520
And if you do not work consistently,

50
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,250
it will be difficult to catch up.

51
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,100
Data show positive correlation between consistent work

52
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,420
and final exam scores.

53
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,110
In other words, if you would like to get a higher grade,

54
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,740
you need to work consistently.

55
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,950
My advice to you is to start each week's work early

56
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,490
and to put effort into learning the material.

57
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,620
You should plan to spend at least 10 hours a week

58
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,910
to succeed in this course.

59
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,690
You will not pass this course if you spend two hours a week

60
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,130
on it.

61
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,290
Because of this time commitment, we

62
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,420
advise you to first realistically determine

63
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,530
if you can afford to spend this much time each week.

64
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,370
If you decide to take this course,

65
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,420
we strongly advise you to plan ahead and schedule time

66
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,110
each week to study and to work consistently.

67
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,820
We have an excellent course team who

68
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,420
will help you learn the content of the course.

69
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,540
To interact with the teaching team and your peers,

70
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,770
use the discussion forum.

71
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,700
The discussion forum is your one stop shop

72
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,427
designed to address all course related questions.

73
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:29,510
If you want to interact with your fellow learners,

74
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,010
or if you have questions that you would like

75
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,770
to ask the teaching team, we invite you

76
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,560
to participate in the forum.

77
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,230
A forum has two types of posts, a question or a discussion.

78
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,720
The difference between the two is as follows.

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,830
If you just want to share an insight or make a comment,

80
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,860
post your comment as a discussion.

81
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,080
However, if you would like to receive an answer,

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,690
then post it as a question.

83
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,520
Some specific tips.

84
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,280
Before asking a question, take time

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,590
to think about the material.

86
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,410
Rewatch the lecture video or a recitation video.

87
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,260
We have invested considerable resources

88
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,990
in making the content very clear.

89
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,270
So chances are, if you have a question,

90
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,360
the answer is already there.

91
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,510
When asking a question on the forum, be specific.

92
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,470
Provide a descriptive title so it is easy for your peers

93
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,320
to find your question and it's also easy for us

94
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,470
to understand what your question is about.

95
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,270
We have designated discussion points

96
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,200
at the end of each module.

97
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,080
So make sure to post the questions

98
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,750
in the relevant forum.

99
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,390
Always be polite and respectful.

100
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,000
We have learners from all corners of the world,

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,820
from different cultures and backgrounds.

102
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,650
Please be polite and respect each other.

103
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,080
We take ethics and professionalism very seriously.

104
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,970
During the final exam period, we will

105
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,050
close the discussion forum.

106
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,540
The final exam is individual work

107
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,500
and we do not allow learners to share information

108
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,750
and to collaborate.

109
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,760
We expect you to follow the honor code

110
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,120
and to uphold MIT's standards of academic integrity.

111
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,286
