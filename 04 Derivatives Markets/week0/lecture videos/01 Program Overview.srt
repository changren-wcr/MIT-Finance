EGOR MATVEYEV: Hello, everyone, and welcome.

This course is part of a MIT's MicroMasters Program

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,780
in Finance.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,510
To the learners who have taken other courses in the series,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,860
welcome back.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,450
To the learners who are joining us for the first time,

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,590
I would like to welcome you to our MicroMasters Program.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,000
My name is Egor Matveyev.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,700
I'm the executive director of the MicroMasters Program

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,520
and a faculty member of the finance group at MIT Sloan

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,960
School of Management.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,890
I joined the finance group at MIT Sloan in 2017.

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,650
I have taught various finance courses in our MBA,

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,950
Masters in Finance, and MBA Sloan Fellows Program.

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,290
The scope of my teaching includes introductory classes

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,450
to MBA students and Sloan Fellows

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,080
as well as an advanced elective in corporate finance.

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,660
I also teach an MIT Sloan action learning course

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,690
in corporate finance and investment banking.

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,382
My academic research covers areas of corporate finance,

20
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:53,340
corporate governance, organizational economics,

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,285
and asset management.

22
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:56,910
In this video, I would like to give you

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,820
an overview of the MicroMasters Program in Finance.

24
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,000
Our program consists of five courses: foundations

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,320
of modern finance part one and two, financial accounting,

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,260
derivatives markets, and mathematical methods

27
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,570
for quantitative finance.

28
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,640
By successfully completing all five courses,

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,020
you will earn the MicroMasters credential in finance from MIT.

30
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,810
How does completing the MIT MicroMasters Program in Finance

31
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,700
benefit you?

32
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,270
First, it can be used to advance your career.

33
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,880
All of our courses have the same rigorous content

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,070
that we teach to our in-residence students

35
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,290
at MIT Sloan.

36
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,030
In all our courses, we have developed

37
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,750
individual proctored exams that allow us to test your knowledge

38
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,620
and allow you to show your understanding of the subject.

39
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,140
Our testing process is rigorous and complies

40
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,100
with our internal practices for MIT students.

41
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,810
Earning our MicroMasters credential

42
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,510
will allow you to demonstrate your finance knowledge

43
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,590
and skills at the level of MIT Sloan.

44
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,870
Second, this MicroMasters credential

45
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,850
can be your first step in earning

46
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,850
a master's degree in finance either at MIT

47
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,400
or at our pathway universities.

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,340
If you're currently a sophomore in an undergraduate program,

49
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,530
starting our MicroMasters program now

50
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,510
would allow you to complete the program

51
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,760
by the beginning of your senior year,

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,470
right in time for your applications

53
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,900
to Masters programs.

54
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,430
At MIT Sloan School of Management,

55
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,180
learners who earn Micromasters credential in finance

56
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,010
are eligible to receive credits for four courses

57
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,320
upon acceptance into the program.

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,470
This would allow you to waive the Summer term

59
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,260
and accelerate program completion.

60
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,140
The list of pathway universities that accept our MicroMasters

61
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,590

62
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,190

63
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,260
degree, our MicroMasters credential

64
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,660

65

as our community of credential holders

66

with the rigor of our content and testing.

68
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,530
You are also welcome to take our individual courses.

69
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,890

70
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,020

71
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,720

73
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,980
