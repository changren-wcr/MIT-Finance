00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
PROFESSOR: I've put together this introductory video

1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,980
for those of you that may be relatively

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,250
new to the world of derivatives or interested in learning more

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,970
about the history, structure, and uses of these markets

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,600
and instruments.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,170
We'll go over the answers to three basic questions.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,610
What is a derivative?

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,410
How are derivatives traded?

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,900
And why are derivatives useful?

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,840
Derivatives are securities whose future payoffs

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,190
are tied by contract to some underlying variable.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,870
That is, the payoffs are derived from or derivative

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,070
of some observable outcome.

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,500
Derivatives are also called contingent claims

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,320
because their payoffs are contingent on the outcome

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,240
of some underlying variable.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,070
The underlying variable is usually

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,530
the price of a traded asset, such as a stock

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,440
or a stock index, an interest rate, or bond price,

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,000
or currencies, or commodities.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,560
The underlying variable could also

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,160
be a property of asset prices such as the volatility

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,870
of the stock market or the maximum or minimum of a stock

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,960
price over some time period.

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,850
Or a derivative could have a payoff

25
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,600
based on a corporate decision such as the decision to default

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,750
on debt or on the level of dividends.

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,800
It could also be based on other natural or economic phenomenon

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,220
like how many inches of rain fall in December

29
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,210
or the inflation rate.

30
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,190
Some derivatives have a payoff tied

31
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,320
to two or more underlying variables,

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,860
like contracts for differences, whose payoffs depend

33
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,560
on the difference between two reference prices,

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,140
say the stock price of Apple versus the stock

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,780
price of Nokia.

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,140
The basic types of derivatives include forwards, futures,

37
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,410
swaps, options, and exotics.

38
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,230
The term exotic usually refers to options

39
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,980
that don't fall neatly into one of the standard categories.

40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,970
We'll spend a week discussing some of these common exotics

41
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,420
and how their values can be determined.

42
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,000
To give a fun example of a derivative,

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,650
the website hsx.com offers foreign contracts

44
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,460
on the box office revenues of Hollywood film releases.

45
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,530
A foreign contract always has a payoff

46
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,440
based on what a price turns out to be at the expiration

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,710
date of the contract relative to the forward price

48
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,750
locked in initially.

49
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,800
These box office contracts are popular with film buffs that

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,630
want to speculate on their ability

51
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,940
to predict which films will be profitable

52
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,220
and which will be flops.

53
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,640
These contracts are for fun and not for real money.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,100
But similar contracts could be used

55
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,780
to help film studios reduce the risk of uncertain revenues.

56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,960
Derivatives are found in many places.

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,420
If you start looking for them, you'll soon

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,980
discover they're everywhere.

59
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,410
Many provisions are standalone instruments,

60
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,000
like the futures and options contracts traded on exchanges.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,340
Others are issued by corporations.

62
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,820
Those include warrants, which give the holder the right

63
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,300
to buy shares of the corporation on some future date

64
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,310
at a pre-specified price, or employee stock options

65
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,880
that are a type of warrant granted to employees as part

66
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,530
of their compensation packages.

67
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,490
Then many derivatives are embedded in other securities.

68
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,100
For example, the owner of a callable bond

69
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,240
has a claim that's equivalent to having a portfolio consisting

70
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,330
of a regular bond plus a short position and a call option.

71
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,660
Repayable mortgages which allow homeowners to pay back

72
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,480
their mortgages prior to their maturity date

73
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,380
also contain an embedded call option.

74
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,470
A convertible bond has an embedded call option

75
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,030
on a stock.

76
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,420
And many structured notes call for contingent payoffs.

77
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,890
Securitization involves packaging together securities

78
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,250
and then issuing claims that have promised payoffs

79
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,970
that depend sometimes in complicated ways

80
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,360
on the realized cash flows from the package of the underlying

81
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,110
securities.

82
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,590
The outstanding supply of a particular derivative

83
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,660
depends on its origin.

84
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,960
For warrants, derivatives embedded in other securities,

85
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,690
and securitization-related derivatives,

86
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,470
the quantity of derivatives is fixed by the issuer.

87
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,100
By contrast, the quantity of standalone derivatives

88
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,070
is not constrained by the supply of the underlying

89
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,910
asset or commodity that the contract's based on.

90
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,460
Rather, it depends on the supply and demand

91
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,380
for the derivative contract in itself.

92
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,320
If a buyer and seller are both opening new positions,

93
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,950
the outstanding supply of that derivative increases by one.
