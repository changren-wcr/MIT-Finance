1
00:00:00,743 --> 00:00:02,160
PROFESSOR: Derivatives are a means

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,970
to transfer risk from those that are exposed to it to those that

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,160
are most willing to bear it.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,500
We'll see that the same derivative contract can

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,830
be used to hedge or to speculate and for more or less

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,460
legitimate purposes, such as to avoid a costly business

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,823
risk, versus avoiding taxes or regulations.

8
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:23,490
Although some people believe derivatives

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,730
are harmful to society because of the way they can be misused

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,430
and the risks they can create, there's

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,320
a strong case for derivatives being

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,710
an overall positive contributor to risk management

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,350
and therefore to economic prosperity,

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,750
although regulatory guardrails are needed to prevent abuses.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,930
I want to turn to four short and concrete examples of how

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,560
derivatives can solve risk management problems and also

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,170
a caution on how they have gotten companies

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,325
into trouble in the past.

19
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:56,410


20
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,310
The first example is a Swiss manufacturer of luxury watches

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,310
who agrees to deliver a shipment to a major US

22
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,880
retailer in December for the upcoming holiday season.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,220
The watchmaker and retailer have negotiated

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,430
a payment of $10 million to be made to the watchmaker

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,470
upon delivery.

26
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,780
The problem for the Swiss manufacturer

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,750
is that the US dollar's value against the Swiss Franc

28
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,620
could deteriorate and reduce the Swiss firm's profit or even

29
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,470
result in a loss.

30
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,740
Currency futures can be used to eliminate this risk.

31
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,020
Specifically, the manufacturer can

32
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,250
enter into a long position in December Swiss Franc futures,

33
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,550
which will effectively lock in the exchange rate now

34
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,960
for the US dollar payments that will be made in the future.

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,800
The second example involves how to lock in profits

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,350
without having to realize a capital gain.

37
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,660
Imagine that Alpha Asset Management

38
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,750
has been investing in the stocks of a gold mining

39
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,770
company for the last five years and has an unrealized capital

40
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,330
gain of $50 million.

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,960
For tax reasons, the fund doesn't want to sell the shares

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,509
and realize the profits this year.

43
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,030
However, it's concerned that the stock price

44
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,240
might fall in the future.

45
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,410
The problem, then, is to find a way to lock in the profit

46
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,410
without selling the shares.

47
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,300
One way to do this is to buy an at-the-money put option that

48
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,150
allows the fund to sell the shares at the current price

49
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,240
on a future date in the event that the stock price falls

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,290
below its current price.

51
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,450
The third example puts you in the position

52
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:43,190
of a portfolio manager of an S&P 500 index fund.

53
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,190
You're evaluated based on the tracking errors--

54
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,000
that is, how closely your daily portfolio return tracks out

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
of the index.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,750
When equity markets become more volatile, tracking the index

57
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,330
becomes more difficult, and tracking errors

58
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,600
tend to rise, which affects your performance and hence,

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,050
your compensation.

60
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,390
How can you insure yourself against the risk

61
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,820
of deteriorating tracking performance at times

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,610
of high volatility?

63
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,550
A solution is to enter into a variant swap

64
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,800
on the S&P 500 index, which pays off proportionally to increases

65
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,490
in market volatility.

66
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,450
Our last example involves the desire to speculate rather than

67
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,010
to hedge.

68
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,590
Say we're back in 2006.

69
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,360
If you were like me, you would have

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,820
believed that the housing market was overheated

71
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,520
and that a major correction in house prices

72
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,280
could cause large amounts of mortgage defaults,

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,860
leading to large losses, particularly on subprime loans.

74
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,900
Betting on this directly was impossible

75
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,940
because you can't short houses.

76
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,570
The stocks that were linked to housing were costly to short,

77
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,600
and their exposures might not be limited to subprime loans.

78
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,420
So how could you make a large-scale bet

79
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,550
against the housing market?

80
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,340
A solution used by the famous investor, John Paulson,

81
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,120
was to use a variety of financial derivative contracts.

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,880
He shorted collateralized debt obligations

83
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,840
whose performance depended on a pool of underlying mortgage

84
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,769
securities.

85
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,079
He also bought credit default swaps

86
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,300
that paid off when mortgages went bad,

87
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,330
and he sold short the ABX subprime index.

88
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,140
When house prices crashed over the next few years,

89
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,060
he came away with millions of dollars.

90
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,690
Unlike that outcome I just told you about for John Paulson,

91
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,540
stories about speculative derivative trades

92
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,540
often don't have a happy ending.

93
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,080
This is a list of some episodes involving

94
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,950
large speculative trades with derivatives that ended

95
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,370
in stunningly high losses.

96
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,700
The potential for large losses is often unrecognized

97
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,370
until it's too late to do anything about it,

98
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,790
and they can result in much broader adverse consequences.

99
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,810
For example, the losses incurred by Orange County

100
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,230
landed that wealthy municipality in Southern California

101
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,690
in bankruptcy.

102
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,870
Regulators strive to prevent these sorts of situations

103
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,530
by designing regulations to improve transparency and limit

104
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,610
the systemic risk that can cause spillovers of losses

105
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,330
into the larger economy.

106
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,050
While those regulations can help prevent some of those problems,

107
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,540
they can't eliminate them entirely.

108
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,900
It's always wise to make sure you understand your risk

109
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,720
exposure when you're dealing with derivatives, products,

110
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,680
and markets.

111
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,870
And hopefully, what you learn in this course

112
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,590
will help you do just that.
