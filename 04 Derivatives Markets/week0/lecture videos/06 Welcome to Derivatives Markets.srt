DEBORAH LUCAS: Hello, and welcome to 15.435x--

1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,990
Derivatives Markets-- Advanced Modeling and Strategies.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,410
I'm Deborah Lucas your professor for this fifth course

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,490
in the MIT Sloan MicroMasters program.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,470
Derivatives are ubiquitous in the world

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,130
of finance and business.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,080
In fact, more than 94% of Fortune 500 companies

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,510
report they use these powerful tools

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,460
to help manage their risk.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,130
Developing a solid understanding of derivatives

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,880
is critical knowledge for some career paths in finance

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,010
and highly useful in others.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,230
Clearly, a working knowledge of derivatives

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,530
is essential if you're dealing with them directly,

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,610
as you likely will be in some areas of sales and trading,

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,800
or if you're working at a hedge fund

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
or in some asset management or risk management roles.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
Large financial institutions like insurance companies

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,710
and commercial and investment banks

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,590
are the single largest users of derivatives

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,920
in order to manage their own risk exposures.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,930
They are also the largest providers

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,900
of derivatives products to the rest of the market.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,870
These institutions employ many talented people

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,730
to carry out these tasks.

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,540
In other financial positions, such as in the CFO's office

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,110
in a large corporation or working in a family office,

27
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,030
you're more likely to be a consumer

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,980
of derivative products, where you'll

29
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,920
use them to help manage risks such as those

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,250
arising from stock market exposures or exchange rate

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,900
volatility.

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,590
Understanding derivatives is also increasingly important

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,470
in the world of public finance, for regulators

34
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,660
of financial institutions, and for

35
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,970
the many financial practitioners working

36
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,090
in central banks, treasury departments, and finance

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,140
ministries.

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,690
Beyond their practical value, many people

39
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,660
find the study of derivatives pricing models compelling

40
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,910
because of their elegance and because

41
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,760
of their track record of success at explaining

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,530
real-world outcomes.

43
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,080
I like to say derivatives pricing

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,510
is where physics meets finance.

45
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,900
That's because the models work so exceptionally well

46
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,620
and also because some of them are literal analogs of models

47
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,900
used in physics.

48
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,050
Although many of the models were developed using continuous time

49
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,780
mathematics and stochastic calculus,

50
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,680
the good news is that you don't have to be a rocket scientist

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,130
to understand and apply them to solving practical business

52
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,370
problems.

53
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,080
We will use math to help develop your basic understanding,

54
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,390
but the major emphasis will be on learning

55
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,350
to use these tools for valuation and risk management.

56
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,500
At MIT Sloan, we're also very proud of the fact

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,540
that many of the most famous derivatives

58
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,960
pricing models were invented right here.

59
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,890
Fischer Black and Bob Merton were both young faculty members

60
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,450
working at Sloan when, together with Myron Scholes at Chicago,

61
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,110
they developed the famous Black-Scholes-Merton options

62
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,550
pricing model.

63
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,980
And Bob Burton's early work showing

64
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,620
how the cost of default risk could be quantified

65
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,690
with a derivatives pricing approach

66
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,250
continues to be widely used by credit analysts today.

67
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,710
As a well-trained financial professional,

68
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,870
it's essential for you to be familiar

69
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,290
with derivative securities and with the analytical methods

70
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,170
that have been developed to understand and deploy them.

71
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,120
Helping you achieve that objective

72
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,220
is the overarching goal of this course.

73
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,780
The course will help you develop a sophisticated and durable

74
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,980
understanding of derivative modeling valuation and risk

75
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,110
management strategies, a basic familiarity with major markets

76
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,440
and instruments, and valuable insights

77
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,010
into current developments in these always-evolving markets.

78
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,130
Ideally, you will come away from this class

79
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,710
with the skills and confidence to apply

80
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,530
what you've learned to the new types of derivatives

81
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,290
that you encounter over the course of your career

82
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,080
and in your personal financial endeavors.

83
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,790
Derivatives have been a large part

84
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,010
of my academic and professional life.

85
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,980
I joined MIT Sloan's Finance group

86
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,200
as the Sloan Distinguished Professor of Finance

87
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,020
in 2010, and shortly after, became

88
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,420
the founding director of the MIT Golub Center

89
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,730
for Finance and Policy.

90
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,089
At Sloan, I teach two classes at the master's level

91
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,920
that emphasize derivatives--

92
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,120
Futures and Options and Fixed Income and Derivatives.

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,090
This course draws heavily from those electives.

94
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,160
I also teach advanced asset pricing

95
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,120
to PhD students in other special topics courses.

96
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,610
Professionally, my non-academic jobs

97
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,460
have primarily been in public policy, including

98
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,400
having been the chief economist for the US Congressional Budget

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,180
Office, or CBO, and then the founding assistant director

100
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,510
for CBO's Financial Analysis division,

101
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,570
a group which puts the tools you'll learn here

102
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,930
into practice to help inform Congress and the public

103
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,020
about the cost and risk of the trillions of dollars

104
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,710
of financial guarantees made by the US federal government.

105
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,130
I continue to do consulting for CBO, central banks,

106
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,470
and other international financial institutions

107
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,620
in this area.

108
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,770
I've also been a director on the boards

109
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,230
of several private financial institutions and corporations,

110
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,340
including currently serving on the board of Chicago Mercantile

111
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,090
Exchange, or CME, which is the world's largest derivatives

112
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,300
exchange and an important innovator in the derivatives

113
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,380
marketplace.

114
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,380
My research is closely aligned with my financial policy

115
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,810
work and the goals of the MIT Golub Center

116
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,250
for Finance and Policy.

117
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,130
It starts with the observation that governments

118
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,070
are the world's largest financial institutions

119
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,700
and the most influential financial decision makers.

120
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,180
My research aims to develop metrics to help governments

121
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,670
make better informed and more transparent

122
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,130
decisions based on the principles

123
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,180
of financial economics.

124
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,630
Many of the projects are related to derivatives,

125
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,510
such as valuing embedded derivatives and government

126
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,840
credit support and valuing too-big-to-fail bank

127
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,860
guarantees.

128
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,480
I'm looking forward to our journey

129
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,670
together through the world of derivatives

130
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,230
and hope you are too.

131
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,380
