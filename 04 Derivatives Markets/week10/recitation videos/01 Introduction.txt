Hello, everyone, and welcome to the 10th and final recitation
of 15.435x.
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing three topics related
to the week 10 lecture.
In the first topic, we'll be reviewing
the concepts of interest-only (IO)
and principle-only (PO) securities.
In the second topic, we'll see how
a securitization and an interest rate swap
could be used to close a duration gap between the assets
and liabilities of a company.
And finally, in the third topic, we'll
be reviewing duration and convexity
with a few multiple-choice questions.
