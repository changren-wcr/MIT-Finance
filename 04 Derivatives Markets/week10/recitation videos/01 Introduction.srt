00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,220
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the 10th and final recitation

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,820
of 15.435x.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,330
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing three topics related

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,790
to the week 10 lecture.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,980
In the first topic, we'll be reviewing

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,890
the concepts of interest-only (IO)

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,940
and principle-only (PO) securities.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,960
In the second topic, we'll see how

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,310
a securitization and an interest rate swap

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,540
could be used to close a duration gap between the assets

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,820
and liabilities of a company.

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,390
And finally, in the third topic, we'll

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,030
be reviewing duration and convexity

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,350
with a few multiple-choice questions.
