1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,850
PROFESSOR: Without further ado, let's

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,760
begin with the first topic, IOs and POs.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,380


4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,850
Recall from the Week 10 lecture that principal-only (PO)

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,059
and interest-only (IO) securities

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,850
could be created from mortgage-backed securities,

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,710
MBSes.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,540
In particular, investors in IOs receive only the interest

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,880
payments from the underlying pool

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,700
of mortgages for the mortgage-backed security

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,170
while investors in POs receive only the principal payments

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,420
on the mortgages.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,950
Let's assume that you're provided

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,610
with the following information on the estimated prices

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,090
and prepayment rates for two different mortgage-backed

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,110
securities, Security A and Security B,

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,250
that are based on the same pool of underlying mortgages.

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,480
In the first column, we see as interest rates increase

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,600
from 6% to 8%, the Percent PSA, which represents the prepayment

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:14,600
behavior, decreases from 450% to 360%, the price of Security A

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,810
increases from $92 to $98, and the price of Security B

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,570
decreases from $103 to $98.

23
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,010
In Part A, we are asked, which of the two securities, Security

24
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,845
A or Security B, is an IO, which is a PO, and why?

25
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:39,540


26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,820
Well, the first thing to ask ourselves here

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,720
is what does the Percent PSA column mean in this table?

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,640
Well, recall from the lecture that the standard 100% PSA

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,230
model assumes that the annual pre-payment rate increases

30
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,670
linearly from 0% immediately after the origination

31
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:07,130
of the mortgage to 6% after 30 months.

32
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,170
Higher values of percent PSA indicate faster prepayment

33
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,380
behavior and as evidenced in the table above,

34
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,290
prepayments generally increase as interest rates decline.

35
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,620
That's why as the interest rate increases

36
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,500
going down the table here, the percent PSA decreases.

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,010


38
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,430
The thing to notice here is that the price of Security A

39
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,160
actually falls when the percent PSA is

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,760
larger and, equivalently, prepayments increase.

41
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,210
On the other hand, the price of Security B

42
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,380
increases when the percent PSA is larger and prepayments

43
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,260
increase.

44
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,490
Since we know that investors in POs prefer faster repayment

45
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,550
of principal -- they are principal-only securities,

46
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,990
by the way --

47
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,620
Security B is the PO.

48
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,430
Security A must be the IO because as prepayments

49
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,100
increase, fewer interest payments

50
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,130
are made to the IO investors.

51
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,310
OK, now that we know that Security B is

52
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,540
the PO and Security A is the IO, Part B

53
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,720
asks to calculate the effective duration

54
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,220
and effective convexity for each security assuming that yields

55
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,400
are currently at 7%.

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,895
That is the median value of the interest rate in this table.

57
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:40,670


58
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,480
We'll recall from the Week 8 recitation that we can

59
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,940
calculate effective duration -- that is,

60
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,700
modified duration that takes into consideration

61
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,160
the influence of optionality --

62
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,710
as follows in Equation 1.

63
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,290
The effective duration is equal to 1

64
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,000
over the initial price of the security times the difference

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,340
between the price of the security when interest

66
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,100
rates fall and the price of the security

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,780
when interest rates rise divided by 2 times S, where

68
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,900
S is the amount that interest rates rise or fall.

69
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,130
Applying equation 1 to both Security A and Security B

70
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,590
yields for Security A an effective duration of 1 over

71
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,480
96.5 --

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,040
that's the initial price when interest rates are at 7% --

73
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,970
times 92 minus 98 --

74
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,430
the price when rates fall to 6% minus the price when rates rise

75
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,780
to 8% --

76
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,220
divided by 2 times s --

77
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,040
s here is 1% or 0.01 as a decimal --

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,410
which is equal to negative 3.1.

79
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,500
A similar calculation for Security B

80
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,490
yields an effective duration of 2.5.

81
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,580
This should make sense because as we discussed in the Week 10

82
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,790
lecture, it's typical for IOs to have

83
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,700
a negative effective duration over a range

84
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,500
of relevant interest rates and Security A, we said, is the IO,

85
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,390
whereas POs typically have a positive effective duration

86
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,890
and we said that security B is the PO.

87
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:33,200
Finally, the effective convexity of Security A and Security B

88
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,270
could be calculated as follows using Equation 2.

89
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,770
The effective convexity is equal to 1 over the price

90
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,860
of the security at the initial interest rate -- in this case,

91
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,330
7% --

92
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,090
times the price of the security when

93
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,820
rates fall to 6% minus the initial price of the security

94
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,170
minus the initial price of the security minus the price

95
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,480
of the security when rates rise to 8% divided by s squared.

96
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,480


97
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,580
Applying Equation 2 to both Security A and Security B

98
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:21,880
yields an effective convexity of Security A of negative 310.9

99
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,670
and an effective convexity of Security B of positive 100.

100
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,660
The thing to note here is that Security A, the IO,

101
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,170
actually has negative effective convexity,

102
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:41,870
whereas Security B, the PO, has positive effective convexity.

103
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,690
This is weird because we're pretty much used

104
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,480
to bonds having positive effective convexity,

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,310
but it's this optionality, the prepayment risk,

106
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,090
that is causing the IO to have negative effective convexity

107
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,320
for the given range of interest rates.
