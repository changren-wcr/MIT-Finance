00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,765


1
00:00:00,765 --> 00:00:01,640
PROFESSOR: All right.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,590
That does it for the first topic.

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,170
Let's move on to securitization.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,830


5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,890
As an example of securitization, let's assume

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,790
that the following bonds are available in the market where

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,900
each bond has LIBOR risk and pricing.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,580
The first bond is a 3.75% fixed-rate coupon

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:31,240
bond that has a yield of 3.716% on a bond-equivalent basis,

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,120
a maturity of five years, a modified

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:42,470
duration of 4.483 years, and a convexity of 25.29.

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,320
The second bond is a zero-coupon bond

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,060
with a yield on a bond equivalent

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:53,090
basis of 3.15%, a maturity of one year, a modified

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:01:01,430
duration of 0.969 years, and a convexity of 1.879.

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,030
In part A, we are asked to consider a plain vanilla

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,380
interest rate swap.

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,600
That is, a fixed for floating swap

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,250
with an annual fixed-rate payment of 3.75%.

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,620
That's the payment on the fixed-rate coupon bond

21
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,240
here in the first column.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,700
And an annual floating-rate payment

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,080
set to LIBOR and a maturity of five years.

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,140
That interest rate is going to correspond to the interest

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,230
rate on the zero coupon bond with a one year

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,680
maturity and LIBOR risk.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,990
What would be the modified duration

28
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,070
of the swap from the perspective of the floating-rate payer?

29
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,930
Recall that the floating-rate payer in a plain vanilla swap

30
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,410
is effectively long a fixed-rate bond,

31
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,240
in short a floating-rate bond with equal long and short

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,790
amounts in present value terms.

33
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,870
Since the modified duration of that long-short portfolio,

34
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,500
is simply the difference between the modified durations

35
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,370
of its component parts, the modified duration

36
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,620
of the swap from the perspective of the floating rate payer, who

37
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,740
is long a fixed-rate bond and short a floating-rate bond

38
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,940
is going to be 4.483.

39
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,570
That's the modified duration of the fixed leg of the swap

40
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,290
that comes from the modified duration of the fixed rate

41
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,210
3.75% coupon bond minus the modified

42
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,500
duration of the floating leg of the swap, which

43
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,030
comes from the modified duration of the one year zero coupon

44
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,110
bond of 0.969.

45
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:56,140
That difference is equal to 3.514, which is positive.

46
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,560
In part B, it stated that Frida Mae

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,730
specializes in financing non-callable commercial

48
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,160
fixed-rate mortgages.

49
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,220
Frida Mae's balance sheet, where all of the figures

50
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,150
are in millions of dollars, looks like as follows.

51
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,790
On the asset side of the balance sheet,

52
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,970
Frida Mae has $280 million in short-term mortgages

53
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,040
with an average modified duration of 0.5 years

54
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,840
and $350 million of long-term mortgages

55
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,100
with an average modified duration of six years.

56
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,170
On the liability side, Frida Mae has $600 million

57
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,320
worth of bank loans with an average modified

58
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:52,110
duration of one year and $30 million of owner's equity.

59
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,190
Now is Frida Mae adversely exposed

60
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,260
to either an increase or a decrease in interest rates?

61
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,890
If Frida Mae wants to use the swap described in part A

62
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,520
in order to reduce the duration gap between its assets

63
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,700
and liabilities, would it enter the swap

64
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,050
as a fixed-rate payer or a floating-rate payer?

65
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,519
Well first, we can find the modified duration of Frida Mae

66
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,170
assets as the weighted average of the modified

67
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:31,450
duration of the short-term mortgages on the assets side

68
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,970
of its balance sheet and the modified

69
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,870
duration of the long-term mortgages on the assets

70
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,300
of its balance sheet where the weights are

71
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,670
given by the value of the short-term or long-term

72
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,420
mortgages, either 280 or 350, divided

73
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,010
by the total value of its assets of 630.

74
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,430
That calculation gives you a modified duration

75
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:04,120
of 3.556 years for Frida Mae's assets.

76
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,930
Clearly, the modified duration of Frida Mae's liabilities

77
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,220
is one year because its only liabilities are

78
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,830
bank loans, which have an average modified

79
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,075
duration of one year.

80
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:19,460


81
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,240
Now since the modified duration of 3.556 years for Frida Mae's

82
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,330
assets is greater than that of its liabilities,

83
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,800
which is one year, Frida Mae is exposed

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,720
to an increase in interest rates as higher interest rates will

85
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,230
cause Frida Mae's net worth, its owner's equity,

86
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,260
to fall in value.

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,140
Frida Mae could hedge this duration gap

88
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,280
by entering the swap as a fixed-rate payer.

89
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,660
Which is effectively long a floating-rate bond and short

90
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,860
a fixed-rate bond and has a negative duration.

91
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,390
In part c, we are asked if Frida Mae enters into the interest

92
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:11,150
rate swap with a notional principal of $370 million

93
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,670
on the side of the transaction recommended

94
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,100
in part B of a fixed-rate payer, estimate what would happen

95
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,270
to the value of owner's equity if interest rates rise

96
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,310
at all maturities by 1%.

97
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,550


98
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,770
Well, we can calculate the change

99
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,690
in the value of owner's equity using the following formula.

100
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,470
The change in owner's equity, E, is

101
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,870
equal to the change in the value of Frida Mae's assets,

102
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,860
short-term mortgages, plus long-term mortgages

103
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,990
minus the change in the value of Frida Mae's liabilities,

104
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,360
loans, plus the change in the value of the swap.

105
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,210
Where d denotes a change in value,

106
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,170
STM denotes short-term mortgages and LTM

107
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,040
denotes long-term mortgages.

108
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,740
Now how do we get these d terms?

109
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,220
Well, recall that we can use modified duration

110
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,520
to approximate the price change of a security

111
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,660
for a small change in interest rates as follows.

112
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,650
The change in price, dP of a security

113
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,650
is equal to the negative of the modified

114
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,520
duration of the security times its price,

115
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,530
times the change in interest rates, dy Therefore,

116
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,590
each component of equation three can

117
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,820
be approximated using the modified duration approximation

118
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,160
on the bottom of the slide.

119
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,560
In particular, the change in the value of owner's equity

120
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,560
is approximately equal to the change

121
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,070
in the value of the short-term mortgages

122
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,640
on the asset side of Frida Mae's balance sheet, which

123
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,700
is equal to the negative of its modified

124
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,970
duration of 0.5 times its value of $280 million times

125
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:20,460
the change in interest rate dy of 1%, or 0.01 as a decimal,

126
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,740
minus the modified duration of the long-term mortgages

127
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,950
on Frida Mae's balance sheet of six

128
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,440
years times their value of $350 times the change

129
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,450
in interest rates.

130
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,690
Plus, the modified duration of the bank loans on the liability

131
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,030
side of Frida Mae's balance sheet

132
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:53,280
of one year multiplied by their value of $600 million times dy.

133
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,850
Plus the modified duration of the swap

134
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,850
from the perspective of the fixed-rate payer,

135
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,110
which is normally negative.

136
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,950
So this term here, the modified duration, is negative,

137
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,410
and we put a negative sign in front of that.

138
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,770
And we add the change in value of the swap, which

139
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:20,510
accounts for the positive sign of 3.514

140
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,610
times the notional value of the swap of $370 million times

141
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,750
the change in interest rate, which overall yields

142
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,380
a change in the value of owner's equity of negative $3.398

143
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,170
million.

144
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:42,620
So owner's equity would decrease in value of $3.398 million,

145
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,210
or slightly over 10%.

146
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,780


147
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,100
In part d, it's stated that as an alternative to the swap

148
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,600
that we just discussed, Frida Mae's CFO

149
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,800
also considers securitizing some of the long-term mortgages

150
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,240
and using the proceeds from securitization to pay down

151
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,630
its bank loans as liabilities.

152
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,510
There is no recourse on the securitized loans.

153
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,700
Show what happens to the balance sheet if $200 million

154
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,870
of the long-term mortgages are securitized.

155
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,110
After the securitization, would owner's equity

156
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,470
be adversely affected by either a rise

157
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,760
or fall in interest rates?

158
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,360
After securitization, Frida Mae's balance sheet

159
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,200
would be as follows.

160
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,860
The two things to note here is now

161
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,080
that on the asset side of the balance sheet,

162
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,770
the value of long-term mortgages has fallen from $350 million

163
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:54,930
to $150 million because we sold $200 million

164
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,910
worth of long-term mortgages through the securitization.

165
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,560
On the liability side of the balance sheet,

166
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,000
the value of bank loans has also declined

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,320
from $600 million to $400 million

168
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,520
since we paid off $200 million of our liabilities

169
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,680
using the proceeds from the securitization.

170
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,910
Now using equation three, the same equation as before,

171
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,360
to approximate the change in value of owner's equity

172
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240
for a 1% increase in interest rates,

173
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,020
we find that the change in value of owner's equity

174
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,380
is approximately equal to the change in value

175
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,000
of the short-term mortgages on Frida Mae's asset

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,970
side of its balance sheet, which is the same as before.

177
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:51,300
Now, minus the change in value of the long-term mortgages

178
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,670
on Frida Mae's balance sheet, which

179
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,860
instead of negative 6 times 350 times 0.01

180
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,140
is now negative 6 times 150, since we sold off $200 million

181
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,760
of these long-term mortgages plus one year, which

182
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,730
is the average modified duration of our bank loans

183
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,330
or liabilities, times $400 instead of $600, because we

184
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,250
paid off $200 million of our liabilities

185
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,570
times 0.01, which now gives us a change in value

186
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:34,720
of negative 6.4, or equivalently the value of owner's equity

187
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,210
falls by $6.4 million, which is actually more than when

188
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,700
using the swap in part C.

189
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:51,180
Which, if you recall, was negative $3.398 million.

190
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,780
In all, the securitization of a large amount

191
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,150
of long-term mortgages will still

192
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,020
leave Frida Mae with exposure to rising interest rates.

193
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,500
Since it's the duration gap, the average duration

194
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,890
of its assets being longer than that of its liabilities

195
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,140
that are funding them, that's causing

196
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,630
the exposure of Frida Mae to this interest rate risk.
