00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,630
PROFESSOR: OK, in the final part of the recitation,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,810
let's review a few rapid-fire questions

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,400
related to the concepts of duration and convexity.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,500
For the first three questions we'll

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,860
consider a five-year, 3.5% coupon

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,020
bond with no embedded options and is priced at par.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,990
For each of the following changes to the bond's structure

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,230
or to the market environment-- just one at a time--

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,080
what would happen to either the effective duration

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,540
or effective convexity of the bond?

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,880
Effective duration or convexity can, one, not change, two,

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,230
become smaller, three, become bigger, or four,

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,870
it's indeterminate.

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,090
In our first situation in Part A,

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,010
the yield curve is going to make a parallel shift downward.

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,920
Well, what would be the effect of this parallel shift

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,560
downward on the effective duration

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,750
and effective convexity of our five-year, 3.5% coupon bond?

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,460
Well, both the effective duration

20
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,810
and the effective convexity would go up;

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,630
they become larger.

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,640
What's the intuition for this?

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,100
Well, the lower yield curve-- the parallel shift downward--

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,430
has the effect of making more distant payments--

25
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,820
those payments in the bond in, say, year four or year five--

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,320
relatively more valuable through the discount rate effect.

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,880
Lower discount rates on longer dated payments

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,160
increases their value.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,500
Overall, this discount rate effect

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,060
is going to put more weight on those more distant terms

31
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,150
in the calculation of duration and convexity

32
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,560
and increase the overall values of effective duration

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,170
and effective convexity.

34
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,750
All right, the situation in Part B

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,430
is now that our coupon bond is puttable after two

36
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,995
years at par.

37
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:07,830
Well, the effect on the effective duration of our bond

38
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,419
would be to lower the effective duration,

39
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,900
so it becomes smaller, and the effect

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,180
on the effective convexity would be

41
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,480
to increase the effective convexity of our bond--

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,100
it becomes larger.

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,140
What's the intuition for this?

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,390
Well, the put option is going to shorten the effective duration

45
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,570
because the likelihood of receiving future payments

46
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,400
in the bond goes down.

47
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,460
If I have this option to sell the bond back,

48
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,980
that's going to reduce the probability

49
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,000
that the holder of the bond is going to receive payments

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,680
in the distant future.

51
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,890
It's going to increase the effective convexity,

52
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,120
on the other hand, by putting a floor on the value of the bond

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,305
equal to the price of the put option as interest rates rise.

54
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:59,500


55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,580
In Part C, the situation is that the probability

56
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,730
of our coupon bond defaulting in any year increases from 0%--

57
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,390
so it's risk-free-- to 3%.

58
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,130
The expected recovery given default, on the other hand,

59
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,190
is unchanged.

60
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,160
Well, an increase in the probability of default

61
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,650
is going to first, lower the effective duration and second,

62
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,800
lower the effective convexity.

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,600
What's the intuition here?

64
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,520
Well, higher default probability is

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,090
going to reduce the present value of more distant payments

66
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,810
relative to the total present value of cash flows, basically

67
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,350
the same intuition as in Part B for the put option on the bond.

68
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,620
However, in this case, it's also going

69
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,150
to pull down the convexity of our coupon bond.

70
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,490


71
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,800
In Part D, we don't have a situation,

72
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,180
just a true or false.

73
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,050
We are asked that since PO securities--

74
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,550
principal only securities-- are derivatives based on mortgages,

75
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,570
and mortgages, as we discuss in the week 10 lecture,

76
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,829
have negative convexity due to the prepayment option,

77
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,410
POs also have negative convexity.

78
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,670
Well, this is false.

79
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,540
As we saw in the first part of this recitation,

80
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,710
POs generally have positive convexity.

81
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,360
Unlike their underlying mortgages, the value of POs

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,280
rise sharply when interest rates fall since the prepayment

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,280
results in the early payment of principal,

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,100
which increases the present value of cash flows,

85
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,200
to the PO investors.

86
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,060


87
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,300
Finally, Part E is asking, is the risk

88
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,730
of default on an underlying mortgage

89
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,970
in a mortgage-backed security relevant to the returns

90
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,850
of investors in a mortgage-backed security

91
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,305
issued by, say, one of the GSEs, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac?

92
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:10,500


93
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,490
Yes.

94
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,980
As discussed in the week 10 lecture,

95
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,220
it's true that investors are promised the full payment

96
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,130
of their principal and any accrued interest

97
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,170
on these mortgage-backed securities issued

98
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,380
by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac because both of them

99
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,670
provide credit guarantees.

100
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,730
However, that doesn't mean that the returns to investors

101
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,460
are not affected by the risk of default

102
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,230
because default could affect the pattern of realized cash flows,

103
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,650
since at the time of default the full amount

104
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,870
owed on the mortgage is repaid to the investors.

105
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,690
Thus, the possibility of default is

106
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,140
going to affect the duration of the mortgage-backed securities

107
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,500
and its exposure to interest rate risk, exactly

108
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,550
the intuition that we went over on Part C on the slide

109
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,900
previously.

110
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,540
Well that does it for recitation 10

111
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,430
and that does it for the recitations for this semester.

112
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,330
Thank you very much, everyone, for coming.

113
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,000
Good luck on the final exam and hope to see you soon.
