00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,967


1
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:03,300
INSTRUCTOR: We'll now turn to the largest securitization

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,115
market, the MBS market.

3
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:07,800


4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,260
A mortgage is a loan backed by real estate,

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,010
either residential, commercial, or undeveloped land.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,620
I'll focus on US residential mortgages,

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,920
which make up the largest part of the MBS market.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,380
The institutional and regulatory features

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,870
of the US residential mortgage market

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,170
have influenced how MBSs are structured,

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,780
and also they affect the supply and demand for the securities.

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,030
Mortgages in the US are primarily

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,560
fixed-rate amortizing loans, most with an initial maturity

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,110
of 30 or 15 years.

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,400
Various adjustable rate options also exist.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,580
What makes most fixed-rate mortgages particularly

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,445
risky for investors is that they're typically

18
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:55,370
prepayable without penalty.

19
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,730
The option to prepay is an embedded call option

20
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,640
whose value depends on the volatility of mortgage interest

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,830
rates and other factors.

22
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,140
Most residential mortgages in the US

23
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,700
are securitized by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae,

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,010
which are government entities.

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,700
Jumbo, very large, and other mortgages

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,030
that don't qualify for purchase by those federal agencies

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,060
are primarily held on the balance sheets of banks.

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,070
Although, in principle, they could also be

29
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,070
securitized, and have been in the past.

30
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,100
Mortgage investors are exposed to a number of risks.

31
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,770
First, there's credit default risk.

32
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,560
Credit risk is mitigated by the value of the real estate that

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,620
serves as collateral, and typical credit loss rates

34
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,360
are quite low.

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,240
In securitizations, credit risk is further

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,940
reduced by a third-party guarantee,

37
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,090
often from a federal agency.

38
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,120
Interest rate risk can be a significant source of risk

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,800
on longer term mortgages.

40
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,960
Recall that interest rate risk exposure

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,030
is proportional to duration.

42
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,670
Because mortgages are frequently prepaid long

43
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,640
before their final maturity, the operative measure

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,430
of their first order exposure to interest rate risk

45
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,830
is effective duration.

46
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,620
For example, a 30-year mortgage typically

47
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,430
would have an effective duration of seven years or less.

48
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,920
As mentioned earlier, prepayment risk

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,890
arises because of the embedded call option.

50
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,410
When rates fall sufficiently, homeowners

51
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,810
have an incentive to refinance their mortgage

52
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,330
at the new lower rates.

53
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,680
The flip side of prepayment risk is called extension risk.

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,120
That risk also arises because of the embedded call option.

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,430
Extension risk refers to the fact

56
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,010
that in a rising interest rate environment,

57
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,850
homeowners will prepay more slowly than anticipated.

58
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,520
That's to the disadvantage of investors

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,620
that would benefit under those conditions

60
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,150
from quicker prepayments, so they

61
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,460
could reinvest their money at the new higher interest rates.

62
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,430
The combination of prepayment and extension risk,

63
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,890
or equivalently, the embedded call option,

64
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,980
causes mortgages to have negative convexity.

65
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,720


66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,310
Interest rate and prepayment risk

67
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,850
can be hedged with delta or delta-gamma hedging,

68
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,370
using the cash market or interest rate derivatives,

69
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,810
like swaps.

70
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,060
In fact, the large portion of interest rate

71
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,570
swap market volume can be attributed to hedging mortgage

72
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,020
risk.

73
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,360
Finally, mortgages and MBSs have liquidity risk.

74
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,060
The liquidity of different securities in the same MBS

75
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,760
structure can be considerably different,

76
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,070
with the riskier securities typically

77
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,150
being the least liquid.

78
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,770


79
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,170
The typical steps in a mortgage securitization

80
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,330
are similar to the ones described earlier

81
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,700
for other asset-backed securities.

82
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,030
First, a commercial bank, mortgage broker, or thrift

83
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,190
originates the mortgage loan.

84
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,630
Second, the originator sells the loan to the securitizer.

85
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,040
In the case of mortgages, typically Fannie Mae,

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,980
Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae.

87
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,840
The securitizer serves a number of functions,

88
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,990
including creating a security backed

89
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,410
by a pool of similar mortgages, guaranteeing

90
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,779
timely payment of principal and interest,

91
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,555
and selling the asset-backed securities to the market.

92
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:26,190


93
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,600
As for any security, an MBS price

94
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,240
is just the present value of expected future cash

95
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,450
flows, discounted at appropriate risk-adjusted rates.

96
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,500
However, for MBS, due to the difficulty

97
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,690
of predicting prepayment behavior,

98
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,120
and the complexity of some of the securities,

99
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,790
cash flows can be challenging to model.

100
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,360
Relatedly, identifying the appropriate risk-adjusted

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
discount rates is also tricky.

102
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,430
A derivatives pricing approach can

103
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,340
be useful for valuing the embedded default and prepayment

104
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,250
options, which are both American-style options.

105
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,370
However, complications arise because

106
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,640
of the complexity of default and prepayment behavior.

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,970
Unlike the American options we've talked about before now,

108
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,550
typically exercise behavior can't

109
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,970
be inferred by analyzing what exercise policy would minimize

110
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,740
the cost of mortgage financing.

111
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,050


112
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,570
A complete discussion of modeling mortgage prepayment

113
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,260
would fill an entire lecture.

114
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,520
So I just want to highlight a few important ideas.

115
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,090
Prior to the very large losses from mortgage defaults that

116
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,570
contributed to the failure of many financial institutions

117
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,360
in the 1980s and again in the 1990s,

118
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,110
prepayment modeling was an afterthought.

119
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,770
A simple but inadequate representation of prepayment

120
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,500
would be to assume a constant annual

121
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,760
or a constant monthly prepayment rate

122
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,010
over the life of the mortgage.

123
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,920


124
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,500
Despite the inadequacy of a constant prepayment rate

125
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,850
assumption, a standard tool used to describe rather than

126
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,590
to predict prepayment rates is called the PSA model.

127
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,450


128
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,680
It assumes a constant prepayment rate after 30 months.

129
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,900
I'll say more about it on the next slide.

130
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,700
The negative correlation between prepayment and interest rates,

131
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,000
and the effect of that on value, makes a constant rate

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,020
assumption inadequate for pricing mortgages.

133
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,150
The state of the art in prepayment modeling

134
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,700
is to take a statistical approach.

135
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,520
Analysis of historical data shows that prepayment rates

136
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,580
are related to loan characteristics, such as loan

137
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,400
size, coupon rate, and the age of the mortgage.

138
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,560
It's related to borrower characteristics,

139
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,210
such as location and income, and to market characteristics,

140
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,130
such as the current interest rate

141
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,400
and the loan-to-value ratio, which varies

142
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,040
with the level of house prices.

143
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,310
Statistical models that aim to simultaneously predict

144
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,890
prepayment and default behavior also take

145
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,530
into account that the two are competing

146
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,820
hazards, in that a loan that has defaulted won't prepay,

147
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,960
and the loan that has prepaid can't default.

148
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,820
My own experience with estimating

149
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,060
these models is to warn you that the parameters tend

150
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,170
to be quite unstable, varying significantly year to year.

151
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,285
That creates a danger of overfitting.

152
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:31,660
I want to emphasize, though, that

153
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,170
despite these difficulties, it makes much more sense to use

154
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,190
statistical models of prepayment than to assume optimizing

155
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,660
models of prepayment.

156
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,870
Mortgage borrowers' decisions about whether to prepay

157
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,110
or to default are complicated by other factors outside

158
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,950
of any model, such as wanting to sell their house, whether they

159
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,060
qualify for refinancing, or the considerable transactions costs

160
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,990
incurred when refinancing a mortgage.

161
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,860
Those complications are captured, indirectly,

162
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,300
using a statistical modeling approach.

163
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,440
This graph illustrates the PSA model,

164
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,860
which is commonly used to communicate assumptions

165
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,710
about mortgage prepayment rates, rather than to predict them.

166
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,740
For instance, you'll see it mentioned

167
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,740
in offering documents for a mortgage securitization

168
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,440
in the context of explaining the risk of cash

169
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,900
flows for different tranches.

170
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,790
100% PSA assumes that the annual prepayment rate ramps up

171
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:36,220
linearly from 0 immediately after origination, to 6%

172
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,210
after 30 months.

173
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,210
The reason for the ramp up is that it's

174
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,750
unusual to refinance or sell a house shortly after taking out

175
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,720
a new mortgage, but the likelihood of those actions

176
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,770
increases over time, until it eventually plateaus.

177
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,100
Again, this is not a prediction of repayment rates.

178
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,580
Often, market conditions have much higher prepayment rates

179
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,680
than 100% PSA.

180
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,950
If the rate was described as 200% of PSA, for example,

181
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,390
that means that the prepayment rate ramps up linearly,

182
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,640
