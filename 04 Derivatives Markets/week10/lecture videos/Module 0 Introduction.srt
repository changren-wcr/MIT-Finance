PROFESSOR: OK, our last topic, securitization,

1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,530
draws on many of the concepts and methods

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,330
that you've learned throughout this class

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,370
and demonstrates their adaptability

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,550
for valuing novel and complex claims.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,160
We'll start with definitions, a product

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,320
overview, a little history, and a discussion of the uses

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,200
and sometimes abuses of securitization.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,380
Securitization is used to diversify, restructure,

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,330
and redistribute credit risk.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,180
We'll look at how this is done with CDOs

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,180
and see why default correlation is a critical input

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,670
into valuing these securities.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,920
Then we'll turn to mortgages and some

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,410
of the many types of mortgage-backed securities

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,450
or MBSs that have been created.

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,860
This is the largest part of the securitization market

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,530
and the oldest in modern history.

18
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,020
In this market, securitization is

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,680
used to diversify, restructure, and redistribute

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,990
prepayment risk and, to a lesser extent, credit risk.

21
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,930
The biggest challenges for pricing and risk management

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,410
of MBSs arise from the complexity of modeling

23
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,590
prepayment behavior.
