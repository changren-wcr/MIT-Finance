1
00:00:01,305 --> 00:00:04,350
PROFESSOR: For securities like CDOs and CLOs,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,270
the main function of securitization

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,850
is to diversify and restructure credit risk.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,850
We'll focus on CDOs since the considerations

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,860
are similar for other credit-sensitive

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,370
securitizations.

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,950
It's common to describe CDOs as involving

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,500
a waterfall of cash flows generated

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,230
by the pool of underlying securities.

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,810
The securitization allocates those cash flows

11
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,140
to different tranches or classes of securities,

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,509
starting with the most senior, going next

13
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,860
to the junior, or mezzanine, classes,

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,460
and finally going to the holders of the equity tranche

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,042
if cash flows are sufficiently large.

16
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,500
The width of the different tranches

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,600
will depend on the riskiness of the underlying

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,010
pool of debt securities.

19
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,410
The riskier the securities, the larger

20
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,090
the equity and mezzanine tranches

21
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,230
relative to super senior tranche,

22
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,640
which is intended to be very well protected from defaults.

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,150
If the super senior tranche is set at 100%,

24
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,450
it's safe to assume that the underlying debt pool will have

25
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,030
a credit guarantee from a third party insurer,

26
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,250
or from the government.

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,010
The term notional here refers to the principal value

28
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,870
of the loans in the pool.

29
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,590
Two more definitions to be aware of, involving more exotic CDO

30
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,090
structures, synthetic CDOs are constructed with reference

31
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,850
to a pool of loans in a credit index.

32
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,840
A CDO squared is a CDO backed by the cash flows

33
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,630
from a pool of CDO securities rather than

34
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,630
by the pooled cash flows of underlying debt securities.

35
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,520
This diagram is an example of a typical CDO structure.

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,260
Imagine that there are $100 million

37
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,200
in principal of the bonds underlying the CDO.

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,100
The average credit rating of those bonds is BBB.

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,220
The CDOs structured with the super senior tranche having

40
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,530
a notional principal of $70 million,

41
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,940
the senior tranche getting the next $20,

42
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,370
then the mezzanine tranche at $7,

43
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,190
and equity with principal of $3 million.

44
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,250
The actual cash flows that come in

45
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,729
will go first to pay back the super senior securities, next,

46
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,790
the senior securities, and so forth.

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,740
Because it's extremely likely that

48
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,620
the super senior securities will be repaid in full,

49
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,500
they receive AAA rating.

50
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,140
Rating agencies also judge the senior securities

51
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,960
to be very unlikely to take losses and assign

52
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,120
a rating of AA.

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,030
The mezzanine securities receive a BBB rating,

54
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,830
the same as on the original bonds,

55
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,560
and the equity is unrated.

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,870
It may seem at first like alchemy to you

57
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,960
that a pool of BBB bonds could be restructured

58
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,410
to create such a large portion of securities carrying a AA,

59
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,980
or even a AAA, rating.

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,170
The reason that's possible is, first,

61
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,100
because the risk is being concentrated onto the mezzanine

62
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,950
and particularly, onto the equity tranches.

63
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,080
Second, the risk in a pool of bonds

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,060
is lower than for individual bonds

65
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,210
because of the diversification of the idiosyncratic default

66
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,460
risk across bonds.

67
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,300
Notice, too, that this looks a lot like the balance sheet

68
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,300
of a firm with risky assets that has

69
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,610
liabilities structured to consist

70
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,930
of safe debt and risky equity.

71
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,670
So there's nothing unusual about transferring asset risk along

72
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,120
with a commensurate difference in expected return

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,770
to leveraged equity holders.

74
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,580
This reference I'm making to the capital structure of a firm

75
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,100
is also intended to alert you to the fact

76
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,620
that the Merton model, and extensions to it,

77
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,812
can be used to price the claims arising from a CDO.

78
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:41,330
This diagram summarizes the conclusions

79
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,340
about the distribution of risk.

80
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,200
The dark bars show the notional share

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,520
of principle held by the different tranches,

82
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,810
whereas the light bars represent the proportion of risk absorbed

83
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,100
by each of the tranches.

84
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,340
Most of the risk falls onto the equity tranche and some

85
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,530
onto the mezzanine trusts, which here

86
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,780
is shown as being further divided between more

87
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,550
or less senior claims.

88
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,850
Very little of the risk falls onto the senior or super senior

89
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,250
tranches.

90
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,770
Before turning to a numerical example,

91
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,500
I want to say a few more words about the mechanisms used

92
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,600
for credit risk transfer.

93
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,170
In a CDO structure, the transfer of most of the credit risk

94
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,770
is to the equity tranche, and that's described

95
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,740
as overcollateralization.

96
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,430
The idea is that the $100 in principle

97
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,280
overcollateralized the rated securities issued

98
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,420
against the pool, in this case, by $3.

99
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,150
An alternative to overcollateralization

100
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,020
is to obtain a guarantee from a credit enhancer.

101
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,740
There are both private sector and public sector suppliers

102
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,390
of credit enhancement.

103
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,870
On the private sector side, insurance companies and banks

104
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,900
sell protection in exchange for a premium,

105
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,750
effectively selling credit default options,

106
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,670
or credit default swaps.

107
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,460
Often, governments also provide credit guarantees

108
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,970
that substitute for the need for equity protection.

109
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,210
That's common in the US residential mortgage market

110
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,840
where Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other federal agencies

111
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,530
absorb the credit risk on most mortgages that are securitized.

112
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,340
Credit enhancement can add value by allowing investors

113
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,180
without credit expertise to feel comfortable

114
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,040
buying these securities with credit risk.

115
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,150
Credit enhancement also improves a securities credit

116
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,180
rating and more highly-rated securities

117
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,500
tend to be more liquid.

118
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,000
