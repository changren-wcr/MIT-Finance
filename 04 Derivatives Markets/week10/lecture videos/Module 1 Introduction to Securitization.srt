00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:01,890
PROFESSOR: Outside securitization

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,950
is a process of collecting and pooling financial assets,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,920
such as loans, and then selling securities

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,750
that are solely backed by the cash

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,090
flows from the asset pools.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,840
These securities are called asset backed securities,

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,570
or ABS, because each pool is backed

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,850
by specific and segregated collateral

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,690
assets with no recourse to the issuers of the underlying

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,520
assets.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,100
Clearly, securitization involves the creation

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,630
of derivative securities.

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,300
That is, the securities and securitization

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,610
are derivatives on the pool of assets that

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,090
are backing the securities.

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,330
As with futures and options, examples of securitization

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,240
can be found that date back many centuries.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,700
However, the modern history of securitization

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,720
started in the 1970s with the first mortgage securitizations

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,080
by Ginnie Mae, a US government entity created

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,720
to securitize residential mortgages that

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,620
were purchased or insured by the federal government.

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,769
The generic term for mortgage securitization products

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,520
is MBS, which stands for mortgage backed securities.

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,700
There are two broad and distinct subcategories of MBS--

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,810
residential, or RMBS, which is backed by mortgages made

27
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,730
to individual homeowners, and commercial MBS, or CMBS,

28
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,040
backed by mortgages on commercial property

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,850
like offices, hotels, and large apartment complexes.

30
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,390
The residential MBS market is the much larger of the two,

31
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,120
and it will be our focus here.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,620
Other terms frequently used to describe certain types of MBS

33
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,500
is CMO or REMIC.

34
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,000
CMO stands for collateralized mortgage obligation.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,230
REMIC stands for real estate mortgage investment conduit.

36
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,930
These terms frequently apply to some of the more

37
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,180
highly structured securitizations

38
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,120
that generate securities with a variety of risk and return

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,230
characteristics.

40
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,100
Beyond mortgages, the collateral backing securitizations often

41
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,500
is composed of loans or debt.

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,880
Those securities are called collateralized loan or debt

43
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,940
obligations, CLO or CDOs.

44
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,460
Beyond those broad categories, just about

45
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,640
any financial obligation can, in principle at least,

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,640
be securitized, and a growing number of assets

47
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
have been securitized.

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,380
Some of those asset classes are listed here.

49
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,950
As you'd expect, the costs of creating, modeling, valuing,

50
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,040
and marketing more novel securitization products

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,500
is much higher than for more established and liquid

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,540
offerings.

53
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,550
Because of those costs, new types

54
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,100
of securitization products usually

55
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,100
only come into being when there is a specific need that can't

56
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,855
be met with existing products.

57
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:55,710


58
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,260
This diagram describes the general process

59
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,840
of creating an asset backed security.

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,970
The assets backing a securitization could

61
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,480
come from a single lender or the securitization

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,080
could pool together loans made by several different lenders.

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,990
The top box, borrowers, let's think of them

64
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,700
as car buyers who take out loans to buy their cars,

65
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,800
represents the loans that will be securitized.

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,850
The borrowers go to a loan originator, the second box,

67
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,220
which could be a bank or a finance company.

68
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,470
The bank or finance company might service the loan itself,

69
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,280
meaning it bills and collects payments

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,130
even after the loans have been securitized,

71
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,830
or the servicing rights could be sold to a third party servicer.

72
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,140
When the originating bank or finance company

73
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,780
wants to securitize the loans it's made,

74
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,440
the next step is to go to a securitizer that will set up

75
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,410
a special purpose trust.

76
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,720
Selling the loans into that trust

77
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,620
makes the loans bankruptcy remote from the originator

78
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,130
and so insulated from the originator's other activities

79
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,620
and obligations.

80
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,460
The securitizer, often an investment bank,

81
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,210
may pay a rating agency a fee to provide a credit rating

82
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,130
for the securities that are issued

83
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,100
against the pool of loans in the trust.

84
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,610
In some cases, some or all of the credit risk associated

85
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,480
with the loans are insured by an insurance company or bank which

86
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,180
receives a fee in exchange.

87
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,150
The securitizer will also decide how to structure

88
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,290
the securities that are issued.

89
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,960
Here, the role of structuring and selling the securities

90
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,220
is represented by the box labeled Underwriter.

91
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,780
The final step is to sell the securities created to investors

92
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,665
that are typically institutions like pension and mutual funds.

93
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:54,850


94
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,200
From the 1980s through the financial crisis of 2008,

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,740
securitization grew exponentially in the US,

96
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,380
and it also grew quite rapidly in Europe.

97
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,560
Those markets shrank following the crisis,

98
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,840
but most have rebounded and growth has resumed.

99
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,010
Global issuance in 2020 was estimated by S&P Global

100
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,640
to be about $830 billion.

101
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,530
What caused this rapid growth and continuing popularity?

102
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,740
A case can be made that securitization increases

103
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,470
the efficiency of debt markets for a variety of reasons,

104
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,150
including improving risk sharing and risk restructuring that

105
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,020
concentrates risk on investors most able to manage it.

106
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,110
Others though have pointed to the use of securitization

107
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,390
as a way for financial institutions

108
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,680
to avoid certain regulations or as a response to the incentives

109
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,430
created by regulation, such as to reduce the size of bank

110
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,180
balance sheets.

111
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,720


112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,300
I want to briefly go over the reasons

113
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,780
that securitization can add value to the economy and lower

114
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,240
borrowing costs.

115
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,670
The natural comparison is to what

116
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:14,140
happens when lending is done traditionally through a bank.

117
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,900
A traditional bank loan bundles all the services

118
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,320
associated with lending into a single institution.

119
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,780
That includes origination, servicing,

120
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,370
collection of defaulted loans, and funding.

121
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,890
With securitization, those functions

122
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,890
can be divided between different entities that specialize

123
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,660
in a particular service.

124
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,900
Specialization can create economies of scale

125
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,930
and other cost efficiencies.

126
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,900
Individual loans can also be very illiquid,

127
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,630
in part because there's a lot of uncertainty associated

128
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,280
with their performance.

129
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,350
For that reason, banks traditionally

130
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,420
didn't sell the loans that they made.

131
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,780
Pooling a large number of loans makes the outcomes

132
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,350
more predictable because of a diversification effect,

133
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,020
and therefore the securitized loans

134
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,690
are more liquid than the individual loans.

135
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,140
Further, structuring can create even more liquidity.

136
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,360


137
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,230
For securitizations that result in securities

138
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,870
that are traded in the OTC market,

139
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,420
there's price information available

140
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,210
that wouldn't be there with privately held bank debt.

141
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,190


142
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,280
Where some banks have limited access to funds

143
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,090
beyond their local markets, securitization

144
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,300
results in securities that are sold into national

145
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,430
and even international markets.

146
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,670
Broadening funding sources tends to lower the cost of funds.

147
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,370
Finally, by restructuring risk and return,

148
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,710
securitization creates a wide variety

149
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,570
of choices for investors.

150
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,180
By seeking to create a variety of payoff structures

151
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,510
to appeal to the widest possible universe of investors,

152
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,310
funding costs are also reduced.

153
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,440


154
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,100
Securitization also creates new problems.

155
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,940
Asymmetric information, which is the fact that issuers know more

156
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,740
about borrowers than do investors

157
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,440
in the securitization, creates several problems.

158
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,430
The first is adverse selection.

159
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,890
Adverse selection is the problem that lenders

160
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,980
will want to sell their worst loans into the securitization

161
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,100
and keep their best loans on their balance sheets.

162
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,900
There are several mechanisms that help

163
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,640
to limit adverse selection.

164
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,760
One is to impose strict criteria for the loans that

165
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,650
are sold into securitizations.

166
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,720
For example, maximum loan-to-value

167
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,600
ratios for mortgages or credit ratings above a certain cutoff.

168
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,260
Another is that it's a repeated game between originators

169
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,790
and the investment bank structuring

170
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,500
the securitizations.

171
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,920
If a particular originator is found to sell consistently

172
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,370
subpar loans, it may be excluded from market

173
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,430
or receive lower prices for its loans.

174
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,480
A second information related problem is moral hazard.

175
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,340
An important function of originators

176
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,760
is to screen out borrowers that aren't creditworthy.

177
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,790
If an originator knows it's going to sell a loan,

178
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,000
it may be lazy about doing the necessary due diligence

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,120
to make sure that the borrower is, in fact, creditworthy.

180
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,400
Again, the greatest protection against this

181
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,340
is the repeated game nature of the transactions.

182
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,610
A lender that's not careful to screen out bad borrowers

183
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,310
may find itself blocked out of the securitization market.

184
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,650


185
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,530
A third type of risk that's important to be aware of

186
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,960
is called model risk.

187
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,100
Securitization can often create very complicated rules

188
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,980
for how cash flows are distributed between claimants,

189
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,230
and it's difficult to accurately model

190
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,070
the price of the more exotic securities that are created.

191
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,310
That creates a winner's curse situation

192
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,160
where the likely buyers will be the investors whose

193
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,450
models produce the most optimistic valuations.

194
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,290
Investors may experience unanticipated losses,

195
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,150
as happened during the 2008 financial crisis.

196
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,390
Finally, investors may underestimate the illiquidity

197
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,850
of certain securities in a securitization,

198
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,710
particularly during times of market disruptions.

199
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,100
I should note that not only investors, but also regulators,

200
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,310
can be caught off guard by unanticipated losses

201
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,590
and their consequences.

202
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,610
Because those risks can impact overall financial stability,

203
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,520
regulators have sought to limit certain securitization

204
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,500
practices that have the potential to be destabilizing.

205
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,000
