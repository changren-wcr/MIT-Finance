00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,020
PROFESSOR: An important driver of risk in CDOs

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,300
is the default correlation between the bonds

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,880
and the reference portfolio of credits.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,040
Sophisticated investors may choose

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,710
to speculate on this default correlation,

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,050
choosing to invest in different tranches,

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,630
depending on how their view of default correlation

8
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,810
affects their perception of the risk-adjusted value

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,670
of the different tranches.

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,550
To begin to understand the effects of default correlation,

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,710
let's consider the loss distribution

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,920
in each tranche as a function of the correlation of defaults

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,980
across pairs of bonds in the underlying portfolio.

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,860
One possibility is a correlation of 1,

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,580
which means either that all bonds default or none of them

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,660
do.

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,070
In that case, the default risk affects all tranches similarly,

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,250
in that all would take losses in the event of a default

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,080
and all would receive full payment otherwise.

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,930
The distribution of losses on a risky portfolio

21
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,690
as a function of the degree of default correlation

22
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,160
can easily be illustrated via a simulation.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,450
Assume a portfolio with 100 names, or bonds, each

24
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,930
with individual default probability of 14%.

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,470
We'll look at the distribution of total portfolio payoffs

26
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,690
when the correlation across defaults

27
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:25,150
is either 15%, 40%, or 100%.

28
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,000
The results of those simulations for the implied distribution

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,950
of portfolio losses are shown here.

30
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,640
When default correlation is low, there's

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,030
very little weight on the right tail of the distribution, where

32
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,190
default losses are the highest.

33
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,720
As default correlation increases,

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,920
the distribution spreads out, putting much more weight

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,800
on the very low loss rates, but also on very high loss rates.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,500
The effect of the tails of the loss distributions getting

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,290
wider affects the various tranches quite differently

38
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,310
from one another.

39
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,770
The safer tranches are adversely affected

40
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,710
by an increase in correlation, because they only

41
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,010
experience a loss when total losses are very high,

42
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,500
and that becomes more likely.

43
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,410
By contrast, the equity tranche holders

44
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,380
are unaffected when large losses become more likely,

45
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,570
because over that range of outcomes

46
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,900
they already would have been wiped out.

47
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,560
Rather, they benefit from the increased probability

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,150
of the left tail, of no or very low default losses, which

49
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,310
is the situation in which they will receive

50
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,410
a full or partial payout.

51
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,860
As this graph shows, the equity and mezzanine tranches

52
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,380
are much more sensitive to the effect of correlation

53
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,860
than is the senior tranche, but its value is also

54
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,290
affected by correlation.

55
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,770
This description also explains why the equity tranches

56
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,670
are described as being long correlation,

57
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,830
since they benefit from an increase in default

58
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,910
correlation.

59
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,230
Conversely, the senior tranches are short correlation

60
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,520
since they're harmed if it increases.

61
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,000
