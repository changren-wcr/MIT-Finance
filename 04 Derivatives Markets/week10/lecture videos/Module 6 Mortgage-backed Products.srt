00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:03,620
PROFESSOR: Let's take a look at some common MBS

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,500
structures and the motivations behind creating them.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,050


4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,290
Passthrough securities are the oldest and simplest structures

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,270
for mortgage-backed securities.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,700
As their name suggests, these securities

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,370
have cash flows that are distributed proportionally

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,490
to the principal value of each security holder.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,650
The repayment of principal and accrued interest

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,880
is generally guaranteed.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,130
The main benefit of this structure,

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,380
relative to investing in home mortgages,

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,260
is diversification of prepayment risk, which

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,270
makes the securities less risky and easier

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,470
to price, which in turn also makes them more liquid.

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,840
This diagram gives a stylized example

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,900
of the structure of a passthrough securitization.

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,270
Here, each mortgage loan is assumed

19
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,140
to have principal of $200,000, and the total pool

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,730
has principal of $1 million based on having five loans.

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,250
Each month, the borrowers make payments

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,660
that consist of interest and principal that comes due.

23
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,800
Plus, they may choose to prepay some principal.

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,080
The pooled cash flows are then distributed

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,080
to investors proportionately, or pro-rata,

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,050
to their principal claim, which is reduced over time

27
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,840
by principal repayments.

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,960
Assuming there's a guarantee against default losses,

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,960
from an investor perspective, a default

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,750
has the same effect of prepayment.

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,840
That is, default results in an immediate return of principal

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,460
to investors that equals the balance of the defaulted loan.

33
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,100
Collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs,

34
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,740
have a wide variety of structures, some of which

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,720
are listed on the slide.

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,810
The strategy of issuers is to carve up the cash flows

37
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,660
to appeal to a variety of investor clienteles.

38
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,700
Some investors can tolerate more risk

39
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,070
than others in the timing and size of the cash flows

40
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,000
received.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,010
Some prefer shorter maturities, and some

42
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,290
prefer longer maturities.

43
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,350
Well, starting with sequential pay structures,

44
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,380
those offer different average maturities

45
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,509
in the different tranches.

46
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:12,320
CMOs that include planned amortization,

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,490
or targeted amortization classes, PACs and TACs,

48
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,460
create securities with very predictable cash flows

49
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,790
as long as prepayment rates stay within the range of upper

50
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,420
and lower bounds that are specified in the contracts.

51
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,580
Now, in order to provide that certainty

52
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,220
to holders of TACs and PACs, other securities,

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,040
which are called support classes,

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,190
are structured to absorb the variation in prepayment rates

55
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,600
within that range.

56
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,030
They receive proportionally larger payments

57
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,580
when prepayment rates are high and proportionally smaller

58
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,280
payments when prepayment rates are low.

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,650
In exchange for absorbing that risk,

60
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,420
the yield on those support classes

61
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,560
is typically higher than on PACs or TACs.

62
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,890
Another type of restructuring is to break fixed rate payments

63
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,330
into two pieces, a floater and an inverse floater.

64
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,750
The sum of the cash flows on the floater and the inverse floater

65
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,040
equal the fixed rate payment.

66
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,190
The floater has a payment that's positively

67
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,530
related to a short term rate like LIBOR,

68
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,720
and the inverse floater receives a payment

69
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,950
based on a fixed rate minus the short term rate.

70
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,260
Inverse floaters can be attractive to investors

71
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,870
that want to invest in securities with a very long

72
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,440
effective duration, and floaters appeal to investors

73
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,270
seeking shorter durations.

74
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,850


75
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,330
You probably remember from your introductory finance courses

76
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,420
that the Modigliani-Miller theorem for capital structures

77
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,390
says that the weighted average yield on all

78
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,520
of these securities should be based

79
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,530
on the fair rate of return for the underlying mortgage assets.

80
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,840
If that were literally true, there

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,900
would be no point in creating these complicated structures

82
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,360
because it wouldn't lower cost.

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,910
Well, although the MM theorem is a good first approximation,

84
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,090
and it's an important reminder that there shouldn't

85
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,960
be any big, free lunches here, the overall cost

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,850
of mortgage capital can be reduced

87
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,710
by catering to different preferences

88
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,080
across investors for liquidity, safety,

89
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,380
and the timing of cash flows.

90
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,680
This diagram provides a simple example of a sequential pay

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,630
structure the pool has the same five underlying mortgage loans

92
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,580
that we looked at in the last example

93
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,580
with a total value of $1 million.

94
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,460
Here, are the securities issued against those cash flows

95
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,560
from the mortgages are structured into four

96
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,120
tranches or classes, A, B, C, and Z.

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,160
Each month, there are scheduled principal, scheduled interest,

98
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,260
and prepayments.

99
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,200
Rather than being distributed evenly across the security

100
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,680
holders, the principle goes towards repaying the Class A

101
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,980
securities until those securities are completely paid

102
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,820
off.

103
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,060
Then it goes to paying off Class B And so on down the stack.

104
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,100
The interest that comes in each month

105
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,360
is distributed proportionally to the remaining principal in each

106
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,790
of the classes A, B, and C. The Z class, which is effectively

107
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,420
an equity tranche, receives no payments until the A, B, and C

108
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,240
securities are fully paid off, after which,

109
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,680
it gets any accumulated interest and the remaining payments.

110
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,710
In terms of effective duration, clearly,

111
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,040
it's also ordered by class, being lowest for Class A

112
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,520
and highest for Class Z. The amount of uncertainty

113
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,420
in the timing of cash flows is also increasing across classes,

114
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,110
with modest uncertainty for the A class and considerable

115
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,820
uncertainty for the Z's.

116
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,490
The reason for that is that the payments on the A class

117
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,190
consist largely of scheduled principal and interest

118
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,700
payments, which are quite predictable, whereas over time,

119
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,620
the importance of volatile prepayments

120
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,210
becomes the most important factor.

121
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,410
IOs and POs are interest-only and principle-only securities.

122
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,410
Like other MBS, they're derivatives on a pool

123
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,300
of underlying mortgages.

124
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,690
They're structured so that the holders of IO securities

125
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,050
only get interest payments, and holders of PO securities

126
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,480
only get principal payments.

127
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,450
Beyond being split between principal and interest,

128
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,940
IOs and POs may be further structured

129
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,460
into PACs, TACs, and support classes,

130
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,820
or into sequential or other structures.

131
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,470
The effect of interest rate changes

132
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,990
is quite different for IOs and POs.

133
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,480
Let's start with IOs and consider

134
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,250
a fall in interest rates.

135
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,170
That has two effects.

136
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,690
There's the usual present value effect

137
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,260
that raises the value of the IO because future fixed payments

138
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,410
are discounted at a lower rate.

139
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,580
However, an offsetting effect is that lower rates speed up

140
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,930
prepayment.

141
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,470
Prepayment is very bad for an IO because when principal

142
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,350
is no longer outstanding, no interest payments

143
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,310
will be made on it.

144
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,040
The effects of prepayment increases when rates fall

145
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,800
means that at least over some range of interest rates,

146
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,180
IOs may be expected to fall in value when rates fall.

147
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,730
That means they have negative effective duration

148
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,990
in that range, which may make them attractive to investors

149
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,990
looking for securities with negative duration

150
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,710
in a long position.

151
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,370
For POs, the effect of prepayment is the opposite.

152
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,260
It causes the return of principal

153
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,510
to happen sooner, which increases

154
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,790
the present value of PO claims.

155
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,540
For POs, the usual discounting effect of interest rate changes

156
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,620
works in the same direction as the prepayment effect, which,

157
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,980
together, causes them to have a longer effective duration

158
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,576
than the underlying mortgages.

159
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:49,076
