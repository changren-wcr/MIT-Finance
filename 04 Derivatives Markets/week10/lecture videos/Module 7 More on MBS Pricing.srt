00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,200
PROFESSOR: As I emphasized earlier,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,810
pricing mortgages and MBSs is complicated

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,700
by having to model prepayment behavior.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,750
Another complication is that credit risk and liquidity risk

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,590
also affect MBS prices but to a much lesser extent

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,390
than prepayment risk.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,420
Earlier in the class, we saw how to price credit risk based

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,670
on a model of asset price volatility

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,190
and how to value callable bonds using a model

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,500
of stochastic interest rates.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,440
The question arises, what's the best procedure

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,260
to use when both call and credit risk are present?

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,440
For MBS pricing in a binomial framework,

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,800
my recommendation is to model the uncertainty associated

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,740
with interest rates explicitly and then

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,170
to incorporate other factors that affect value

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,010
like credit and liquidity via an assumption about a market

18
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,010
spread over the risk-free rate.

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,130
The final example I'm about to turn to

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,050
illustrates that procedure.

21
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,410
In cases where default risk is judged to be insignificant,

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,379
for instance, because there's a credit guarantee,

23
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,600
this is a reasonable approach.

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,260
However, I want to note that in instances where both interest

25
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,570
rate and default risk are important,

26
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,480
it's probably best to use a risk-neutral Monte

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,510
Carlo with two stochastic processes, one

28
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,850
for each major source of risk.

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,400
I now want to turn to a simple binomial example that

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,670
captures the idea of pricing MBS on an interest rate

31
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,410
tree augmented by a statistical model of pre-payment.

32
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,180
In this example, I'll start with this binomial tree here.

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,510
It represents the evolution of the risk-free rate.

34
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,050
For simplicity, I'm going to assume that all paths are

35
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,150
equally likely.

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,190
For each path through the interest rate tree

37
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,860
imagine linking it to a pre-payment model that

38
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,980
is a function of market interest rates, when rates go down,

39
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,510
prepayment rates go up.

40
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,210
On paths where past prepayments are higher,

41
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,070
future cash payouts will be lower

42
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,720
because interest payments are reduced

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,150
and there will be less principal left to pay off.

44
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,100
The story provides a loose motivation

45
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,310
for the patterns of cash flows shown on each path

46
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,600
through this tree, that is I assume the payment at time 1

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,140
is expected to be $100 given the current market conditions

48
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,820
at time 0.

49
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,480
When rates rise at time 1 there is no change in the expected

50
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,810
payment size at time 2 but when rates fall,

51
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,920
there's an additional prepayment of $50 expected at time 2.

52
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,810
When rates rise from time 1 to time 2, the payment at time 3

53
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,660
is lower than if rates fall over that interval,

54
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,270
again reflecting more prepayments when rates fall.

55
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,170
Because MBSs are illiquid and there may be some default risk,

56
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,440
investors demand a spread above the risk-free rate.

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,750
Let's assume we estimate that spread to be 0.25%.

58
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,140
This slide shows that spread added to all the rates

59
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,940
on the previous tree.

60
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,860
The cash flows are the same as before.

61
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,800


62
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,520
The final step in valuing the MBS is to discount the cash

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,070
flows back along each path of the tree

64
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,490
using the risk-adjusted rates on the tree for discounting

65
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,400
and taking into account the probability of each path.

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,910
Notice that in this example, MBSs

67
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,440
are like exotic options with path dependence.

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,450
The conclusion we reach averaging

69
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,060
across all the paths, which remember

70
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,220
were assumed to be equally likely,

71
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:41,270
is that the security is worth $269.81.

72
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,220
We've come to the end of this lecture

73
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,990
and also to the end of the class.

74
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,380
I want to thank all of you who have put in the effort

75
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,900
to understand this challenging material

76
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,940
and to learn how to apply the ideas

77
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,210
and models to a wide variety of practical applications.

78
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,000
I hope these skills serve you well

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,100
in your future financial endeavors

80
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,240
personal and professional.

81
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,390
And I wish you success on the final and beyond.

82
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,000
