1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,650
PROFESSOR: This example provides a quantitative illustration

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,240
of the effect of the assumed default

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,880
correlation on the pricing and yields of different CDO

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,380
tranches.

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,040
The simple CDO here is based on just two underlying nodes,

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,460
both zero coupon with one year maturities.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,590
The first has a principal or face value of 100.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,350
And in the event it defaults, the estimated recovery is $50.

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,020
It's priced at $95 in the market.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,520
The second node has a principal or face value of $200.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,400
And in the event of default, the expected recovery

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,680
is 40% or $80.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,600
It's priced at 179.50.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,600


15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,900
Let's assume that the one-year LIBOR rate is 2%

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,170
and that it represents the appropriate risk-free rate

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,830
for these calculations.

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,470
From this information, as a first step,

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,290
we can impute an implied risk-neutral probability

20
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,430
of default for each of the nodes from the equations here

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,660
equating the expected risk-neutral payoff discounted

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,540
at the risk-free rate to the observed market

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,680
price of each bond.

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,990


25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,230
Risk-neutral expected payoff discounted back

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,520
when period for node one implies a risk-neutral probability

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,740
of 6.2%.

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,810
And for node two, the imputed risk-neutral probability

29
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,640
is 14.1%.

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,250
These imputed default probabilities in themselves

31
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,860
imply nothing about the correlation between default

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,240
on the two nodes.

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,030
One way to incorporate the effect of correlation

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,820
is to make an assumption about the probability of defaults

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,730
occurring simultaneously.

36
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,760
Let's first assume that the joint probability of default

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,180
is 1%.

38
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,460
With that assumption, we can infer the probability

39
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,430
of every possible outcome.

40
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,880
One is that only the first node defaults.

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,680
That equals the probability that node

42
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,229
one defaults minus the probability that they

43
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,840
both default, which is 6.2% minus the 1% joint probability

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,736
or 5.2%.

45
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,800


46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,520
The second possibility is that only node two defaults.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,110
That equals the probability that node

48
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,910
two defaults minus the joint probability, which

49
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,720
is 14.1% minus 1%, or 13.1%.

50
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,370
Again, the probability that they both default is 1%.

51
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,960
And now, the last possibility is that neither defaults.

52
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,330
And that's equal to 100% minus the probability

53
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,630
that there's any other combination of defaults,

54
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,070
and the result is that the probability of no default

55
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,006
is 80.7%.

56
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:06,160
Now, let's turn to the CDO structure.

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,040
The payoffs are divided into three tranches--

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,750
a senior tranche of 220 principal, a mezzanine tranche

59
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,340
of 60 principal, and a junior tranche of 20 principal.

60
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,730


61
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,640
This table summarizes the payoffs and probabilities

62
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,400
and the calculation of implied prices and yields

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,500
for each of the tranches.

64
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,950
The four possible scenarios with their associated probabilities

65
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,410
and total payouts are shown on the left here.

66
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,950


67
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,470
The next portion of the table reflects a waterfall

68
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,560
of the total payments, which go to the senior tranche

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,470
first, then to the mezzanine tranche

70
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,620
if payouts exceed $220, and finally, to the junior equity

71
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,640
tranche if payouts exceed $280.

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,690
For example, the senior tranche is paid in full

73
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,325
if there's no defaults or if only node one defaults.

74
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:12,360


75
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,990
It receives a payment of 180 if only

76
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:22,430
node two defaults and a payment of 130 if both nodes default.

77
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,780
We can weight each of those outcomes by the probability

78
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,370
of that outcome to get an expected risk-neutral payout

79
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,240
of 213.80.

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,430
The junior tranche is only paid if no default occurs.

81
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,290
In which case, it gets 16.1 and that occurs with a probability

82
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,000
0.807.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,230
So the expected payout is 16.10.

84
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,560
To get from those expected payouts to the price,

85
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,650
the prices are found by discounting

86
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,280
those risk-neutral expected payouts by the risk-free rate.

87
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,500


88
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,910
The implied yield as an annual percentage rate

89
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,210
is found then as the ratio of the promised payment

90
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,070
to the price minus 1.

91
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,000


92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,210
The yield on the senior tranche is 2.9% higher

93
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,390
than the risk-free rate, which reflects that it will not be

94
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,970
fully repaid in some scenarios.

95
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,580
The yields on the mezzanine and junior tranches

96
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,000
are very high, because the expected payouts are much lower

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,310
than the promised payouts.

98
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,190
To see the effect of increasing the default correlation,

99
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,890
we can do the same analysis but under the assumption

100
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,710
of a higher probability that both nodes

101
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,930
will default at the same time.

102
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,880
Increasing that probability will also

103
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,120
increase the likelihood of no default, which we will expect

104
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,920
will help the junior tranche.

105
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,740
We also expect it will hurt the senior tranche

106
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,220
by increasing the size of the expected losses there.

107
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,140
Let's see what happens when we increase

108
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,260
the probability of both nodes defaulting simultaneously

109
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,830
from 1% to 3% and keep everything else

110
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,420
as it was before.

111
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,090
Recomputing the probability of every possible outcome

112
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,970
has the expected result that the probability

113
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,190
of both nodes defaulting is higher

114
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,390
and so is the probability of neither node defaulting.

115
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:37,910
The probability of just one node defaulting is lower.

116
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,150
This table redoes all of the previous calculations based

117
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,370
on the 3% joint probability of default. As we expected,

118
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,460
the estimated value of the junior tranche increases

119
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,170
and the value of the senior tranche

120
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,590
falls relative to when the correlation was lower

121
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,720
and the implied yields change commensurately.

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
Notice that, in this example, I simply made an assumption

123
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,750
about the joint probability of default.

124
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,940
There are a number of statistical approaches

125
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,670
that have been developed to estimate default correlations

126
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,890
that are discussed in the whole textbook

127
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,750
and also in other sources.

128
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,490
There are several takeaways I'd like

129
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,510
you to get from this analysis.

130
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,650
The first is that it's critical to take into account default

131
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,030
correlation and pricing CDOs or similar structures.

132
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,670
When we discussed credit risk last week,

133
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,190
we saw how defaults historically are

134
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,650
highly concentrated in recessions, which

135
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,200
means that, in fact, there is a positive default

136
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,070
correlation across bonds and other risky loans.

137
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,550
The second takeaway is that this may be one reason

138
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,970
that, during the financial crisis of 2008,

139
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,670
there were unanticipated losses by holders

140
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,300
of senior claims on mortgage-backed securities.

141
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,800
Apparently, many market participants,

142
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
including credit rating agencies,

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,940
hadn't taken into account the positive default correlation

144
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,490
that led their models to overestimate

145
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,580
the value and the safety of the senior tranches

146
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,450
of mortgage-backed securities.

147
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,000
