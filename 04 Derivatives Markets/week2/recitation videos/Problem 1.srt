00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:02,750
J R SCOTT: Hello, everyone and welcome to the second

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,750
recitation of 15.435x.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,119
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,110
futures contracts and swaps.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,880
The recitation will consist of three problems.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,850
In the first problem, we'll see how

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,250
two companies with different borrowing rates

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,310
can mutually benefit from a swap.

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,860
In the second problem, we'll see how a futures

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,840
contract can be used for hedging as well as speculation motives.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,840
And in the third problem, we'll review some of the mechanics

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,710
and pricing of currency swaps.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,080
Without further ado, let's begin.

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,120
Problem 1-- company A, a British manufacturer,

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,960
wishes to borrow US dollars at a fixed rate of interest.

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,700
Company B, a US multinational, wishes to borrow sterling

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,670
at a fixed rate of interest.

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,420
They've been quoted the following interest

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,500
rates per annum, adjusted for differential tax rates.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,860
Company A can borrow in pounds at 11% and in dollars at 7%.

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,730
Company B can borrow in pounds at 10.6%

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,090
and in dollars at 6.2%.

23
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,810
Design a swap that will net a financial institution, acting

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,380
as an intermediary, 10 basis points per annum,

25
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,680
and will produce a gain of 15 basis points per annum

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,290
for each of the two companies, relative to what

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,940
they would pay borrowing directly

28
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,090
in their preferred currencies.

29
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,640
The first thing to note is that company A

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,970
has a relative advantage when borrowing in pounds.

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,340
Although it costs company a 40 basis points

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,760
more to borrow in pounds relative to company B,

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,430
it costs company a 80 basis points more

34
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,140
to borrow in dollars.

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,560
Symmetrically, company B has a relative advantage

36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,600
when borrowing in dollars.

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,230
I like to think of this setup like an international trade.

38
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,340
For company B, it has an absolute advantage in borrowing

39
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,640
in both sterling and in dollars, although company

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,340
has a relative advantage, sometimes

41
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,270
called a comparative advantage, when borrowing in pounds.

42
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,940
This fact leads us to say that there

43
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,160
is an opportunity for both companies

44
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,140
to lower their borrowing costs using

45
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,260
a fixed-for-fixed currency swap.

46
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,150
This question is asking us how exactly

47
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,760
the swap should be structured.

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,310
Let's assume that both company A and company

49
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,030
B want to borrow the same principal amount, which we I'll

50
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,820
denote capital P, in dollars, and capital P-star in pounds.

51
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,980
Let's assume that company A initially

52
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,230
borrows P-star in pounds at an interest rate of 11%.

53
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,360
In the swap, the intermediary is going to exchange P-star for P

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,170
at the spot exchange rate between pounds and dollars.

55
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,480
Since we're on an annual basis, the swap

56
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
can be structured so that every year, company

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,270
A pays a fixed interest rate on the principal, P,

58
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,050
to the intermediary in dollars, and receives a fixed interest

59
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,010
rate on the principal, P-star in pounds.

60
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,560
To finance its loan, company A needs

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,540
to receive at least a fixed interest rate of 11% in pounds.

62
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,720
Since company A wants to borrow in US dollars,

63
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,520
it will pay an interest rate that

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,240
is 15 basis points less than the 7% interest

65
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,690
rate it could have paid without the swap, or 6.85%.

66
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,915
What about company B?

67
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:35,720
Company B initially borrows P in dollars

68
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,410
at an interest rate of 6.2%.

69
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,650
In the currency swap, the intermediary exchanges

70
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,060
P for P-star at the spot exchange rate.

71
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,030
Each year, company B pays a fixed interest rate

72
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,410
on the principal, P-star to the intermediary in pounds

73
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,120
and receives a fixed interest rate

74
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,780
on the principal P, in dollars.

75
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,420
To finance its loan, company B needs

76
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,691
to receive a fixed interest rate of at least 6.2% in dollars.

77
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,460
Since company B wants to borrow in pounds,

78
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,170
it will pay an interest rate that

79
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,430
is 15 basis points less than the 10.6% interest

80
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,120
rate it could have paid without the swap or 10.45%.

81
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,900
At the terminal date of the currency swap,

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,900
the principal is exchanged again.

83
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,110
The intermediary is going to earn a spread of 10 basis

84
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,240
points on the swap.

85
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,300
The spread is partly compensation for the exchange

86
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,150
rate risk faced by the intermediary

87
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,830
but in principle, the intermediary

88
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,430
could always hedge this risk using forward contracts.

89
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,100
The more important risk is counterparty risk,

90
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,760
the risk that either company A or company B fails

91
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,580
to meet its obligations.

92
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,877
The diagram below summarizes the cash flows of the swap.

93
00:04:57,877 --> 00:04:59,460
The kind of an important thing to note

94
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,250
here is that at initiation, the principal

95
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,730
amounts P and P-star flow in the opposite direction

96
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,260
of the arrows.

97
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,020
Interest payments flow in the same direction as the arrows

98
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,380
during the life of the swap and the principal amounts also

99
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,390
flow in the same direction as the arrows

100
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,140
at the terminal date of the swap.
