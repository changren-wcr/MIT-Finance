1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,540
PROFESSOR: Now that we've had an example of a futures contract,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,510
let's finish up the recitation with one final problem

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,240
about swaps.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,150
In this case, we have a currency swap with a remaining

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,340
life of 15 months.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,230
The swap involves exchanging interest

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,130
at 10% on 20 million pounds for interest

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,290
at 6% on $30 million US dollars once a year.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,900
The term structure of risk-free interest rates in the United

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,590
Kingdom is flat at 7%, and the term structure

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,640
of risk-free rates in the United States is flat at 4%.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,510
Both of these interest rates are with annual compounding.

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,720
The current exchange rate is 1.55 dollars

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,020
per pound sterling.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,660
In part A we are asked, what is the value

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,660
of the swap to the party paying sterling,

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,750
equivalently receiving dollars?

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,750
Well, before we begin solving this question,

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,750
we should first note that the swap involves

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,670
exchanging the sterling interest of 20 times 10%, which

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,150
equals 2 million pounds for the dollar

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,620
interest of $30 times 6%, which equals $1.8 million.

23
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,880
And of course, with any currency swap,

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,490
the principal amounts are also exchanged

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,950
at the swap's terminal date.

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,260
So there's an easy way to solve this question,

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,660
and there's a hard way to solve this question.

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,300
I thought in part A, we would start with the easy way

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,210
to solve this question-- the so-called bond valuation

30
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,590
method.

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,890
The key here is to notice that the cash flows of the swap

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,520
are identical to those of a coupon bond.

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,150
The value of the sterling bond underlying the swap

34
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,990
is as follows.

35
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,090
It's the sum of the 2 million pounds of interest received

36
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,080
three months into the 15 month period discounted

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,940
at the constant 7% interest rate, plus the sum of the 2

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,970
million pounds interest plus the 20 million

39
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,960
pound principal amount received 15 months later,

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,960
discounted at the 7% constant risk-free rate,

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,990
which is equal to 22.182 million pounds.

42
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,400
Similarly, the value of the dollar bond underlying the swap

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,920
is also the sum of two terms.

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,240
In the first term, we have $1.8 million interest,

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,570
received 3 months into the 15 month period,

46
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,650
discounted at the 4% constant risk-free rate.

47
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,950
And the second term, we have the $1.8 million

48
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,050
interest received 15 months later, plus the $30 million

49
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,620
principal amount also received 15 months later,

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,790
both discounted at the 4% constant risk-free rate, which

51
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,600
gives us a total of $32.061 million.

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,640
Thus, the value of the swap to the party

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,000
paying sterling and receiving dollars--

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,180
which will be a number in dollars--

55
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,910
is the difference between the value of the dollar bond

56
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,200
underlying the swap--

57
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:17,040
$32.061 million-- minus the value of the sterling bond

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,680
underlying the swap adjusted for the risk-free rate.

59
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,460
So the 22.182 million pounds times the exchange rate

60
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,060
of 1.55 dollars per pound.

61
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,220
The difference between these two quantities

62
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,940
is negative 2.321 million.

63
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,960
Thus, the value of the swap to the party paying sterling

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,340
is a negative amount--

65
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,000
negative 2.321 million dollars.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,900
In part B, we're asked, what is the value

67
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,910
to the party paying dollars and receiving sterling?

68
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,880
Now, the easy way to answer this question is to notice that

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,430
since the cash flows here are reversed--

70
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,950
it's just the opposite leg of the swap--

71
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,260
the value of the swap to the party paying dollars

72
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,300
is the negative of the value to the party paying sterling.

73
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,720
And the negative of negative $2.321 million

74
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,470
is simply $2.321 million.

75
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,829
Now, the harder method for solving this question

76
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:25,350
that I alluded to above, is to view this swap as a portfolio

77
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,030
of forward contracts.

78
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,230
Now, how do we solve this using the hard method of viewing

79
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,890
the swap as a sequence of forward contracts?

80
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,380
Well, first to be consistent with part A,

81
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,530
we will value the swap to the party paying sterling

82
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,635
and receiving dollars.

83
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:44,010
So we should get an answer that's

84
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,700
very similar to part A. The first step is to note,

85
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,680
that since we're given annual interest rates,

86
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,980
and we need continuously compounded interest

87
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,590
rates in order to calculate the forward exchange

88
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,860
rates 3 and 15 months from now, we

89
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,270
can convert our annual interest rates into continuously

90
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,470
compounded interest rates by taking the natural log of 1

91
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,880
plus the annual interest rate expresses a decimal.

92
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,840
So for instance, for the continuously compounded

93
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,000
interest rate in sterling, we take

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,860
1 plus the 7% annual interest rate in sterling.

95
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,050
And the natural log of that is 6.766% per annum.

96
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,360
And similarly, the 4% annually compounded

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,620
interest rate in dollars expresses a decimal plus 1.

98
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:44,060
And take the natural log of that gives us 3.922% per annum.

99
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,430
So we have these two continuously compounded

100
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,450
interest rates.

101
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,900
What we need now is to find the forward exchange rates-- that

102
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,480
is the exchange rates in the future, 3 months and 15 months.

103
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,520
Well, the 3 month forward exchange rate

104
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,400
is equal to the current exchange rate, which is $1.55 per pound,

105
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,880
times the exponential of the difference in the continuously

106
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,760
compounded interest rates in dollars--

107
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,460
3.922% expressed as a decimal--

108
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,490
and in sterling-- 6.766% expressed as a decimal--

109
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,610
times an adjustment for 3 months in the future--

110
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,320
3 over 12, which is equal to 1.539.

111
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,050
Pretty close, but slightly below our current exchange

112
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,600
rate of 1.55.

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Similarly, the 15 month forward exchange rate

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,380
is equal to the current exchange rate of dollars per pounds,

115
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,800
multiplied by the exponential of the difference

116
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,420
in the continuously compounded dollar and Sterling interest

117
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,690
rates.

118
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,693
But now, our adjustment is 15 over 12 for the discounting,

119
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:54,110
since this is the forward exchange

120
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,080
rate 15 months in the future.

121
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,710
That foreign exchange rate is 1.4959--

122
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,630
significantly less than the current exchange

123
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,880
rate of $1.55 per pound.

124
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,070
Now, given that we have the 3 month and 15 month forward

125
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,650
exchange rates, we can find the values

126
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,200
of the two forward contracts corresponding

127
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,930
to the exchange of fixed interests

128
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,140
for the party paying sterling and receiving dollars

129
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,490
as follows.

130
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,800
In the first equation, we have the difference

131
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,690
between the $1.8 million in fixed interest received

132
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,730
in 3 months, minus 2 times the 3 month forward exchange

133
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:43,780
rate of 1.539, discounted at the dollar

134
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,990
continuously compounded interest rate of 3.922% multiplied by 3

135
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:56,860
over 12, which is equal to a negative $1.256 million.

136
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,560
Now, the value of the forward contract corresponding

137
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,660
to the exchange of interest for the party paying sterling in 15

138
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,830
months is again $1.8 million, minus 2,

139
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,590
times the foreign exchange rate for 15 months 1.4959,

140
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,780
times the exponential of negative 0.3922,

141
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,990
again discounting at the 3.922% continuously compounded dollar

142
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,030
interest rate, times 15 over 12--

143
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:34,510
since we're now 15 months into the future, again,

144
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,470
so that's the 15 over 12 term--

145
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:43,299
which gives us a total value of negative $1.1347 million.

146
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,150
Now that we've found the value of the two forward contracts

147
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,260
corresponding to the exchange of fixed interest in 3 and 15

148
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,990
months according to the perspective of the party that

149
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,290
is paying sterling and receiving dollars,

150
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,410
we can find the value of the forward contract corresponding

151
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,250
to the exchange of principals as follows.

152
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,950
For then the perspective of the party that

153
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,500
is paying sterling and receiving dollars,

154
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,510
it's equal to the difference between the $30 million

155
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:17,290
principal and the 20 million pounds principal,

156
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,260
adjusted for the forward exchange rate 15 months

157
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,960
from now of 1.4959 dollars per pound,

158
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,450
discounted by the exponential of negative 0.3922--

159
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,610
remember, that's the decimal form

160
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,930
of the continuously compounded dollar interest rate--

161
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,180
times 15 over 12, for the fact that the exchange of principals

162
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,340
occurs at the terminal date of the swap 15

163
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,440
months in the future, which gives us

164
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,240
a total amount of $0.0787 million

165
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,970
for the value of the forward contract

166
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,310
corresponding to the exchange of principals.

167
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,230
So the total value of the swap according to the party

168
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,840
paying sterling is going to be the sum of three

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,990
different forward contracts: the two forward contracts

170
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,180
corresponding to the exchange of interest

171
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,500
in 3 months and 15 months that we found here--

172
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,740
the negative $1.2656 million, and negative $1.1347 million,--

173
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,600
plus the value of the forward contract corresponding

174
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,990
to the exchange of principals at the end of 15 months, which

175
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:36,200
is $0.0787 million, which gives us a total of negative $2.322

176
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,300
million.

177
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,750
Which, if you'll recall from part A,

178
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,900
according to some rounding errors,

179
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,140
is very close to that which we obtained using the bond

180
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,440
valuation method.

181
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,813
So that wraps up recitation two.

182
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:54,730
Thank you all for attending and I look forward

183
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,030
to seeing you next week.
