PROFESSOR: OK, now that we've had

1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,340
some practice with a currency swap,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,630
let's move on to a question about futures contracts.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,940
In this problem, we are asked to imagine

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,630
that a commercial builder takes a short position in a mortgage

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,960
futures contract, which locks in a borrowing rate linked

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,570
to the price of a mortgage-backed security

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,970
or MBS.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,640
The commercial builder, however, has no plans

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,070
to borrow using a mortgage.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,460
Do you think that shorting the futures contract, in this case,

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,730
is speculating or hedging?

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,510
All right, before we solve this question,

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,200
we should first review the mechanics of a mortgage futures

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,940
contract.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,040
A mortgage futures contract is similar

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,860
to the familiar commodities futures contract

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,650
that Professor Lucas reviewed in lecture, except, in this case,

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,970
the commodity is a mortgage-backed security,

19
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,800
a security which is backed by the cash

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,470
flows from a pool of mortgages.

21
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,990
So a mortgage futures contract locks in a pre-specified price

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,920
for a mortgage-backed security, equivalently, a borrowing rate

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,660
on a mortgage in the future.

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,360


25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,550
Well, armed with that information,

26
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,640
we could see that a long position in a mortgage futures

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,940
contract will increase in value if the price

28
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,580
of the mortgage-backed security increases,

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,170
or, equivalently, if interest rates decrease.

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,870
The way to see this is to recall that prices

31
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,170
in yields or interest rates on fixed income securities

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,420
move inversely.

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,410
A short position, on the other hand,

34
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,470
will decrease in value if the price

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,720
of the mortgage-backed security decreases,

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,230
or, equivalently, if interest rates increase.

37
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,150
Now, since the commercial builder

38
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,320
is taking a short position in the mortgage futures contract,

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,260
he will profit if interest rates increase

40
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,760
or if the mortgage-backed security declines in price.

41
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,450
Typically, higher interest rates discourage real estate

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,440
investment.

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,340
So it is reasonable to think that the commercial builder is

44
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,670
shorting the mortgage futures contract to protect himself

45
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,580
against a decline in the demand for commercial real estate

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,170
construction.

47
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,270
This would be consistent with a hedging

48
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,640
motive and not necessarily a speculative motive.
