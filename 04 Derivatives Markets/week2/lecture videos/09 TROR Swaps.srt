00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,150
PROFESSOR: The final category of swaps

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,340
I want to introduce you to are called

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,109
total rate of return swaps.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,470
These total rate of return swaps are a versatile tool to gain

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,220
or offload customized risk exposure to just about

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,200
any asset you can imagine.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,570
They're particularly popular tools

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,300
for hedge funds wanting to gain leveraged risk

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,350
exposures to assets that might be illiquid or hard to obtain

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,230
directly.

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,400
In a total rate of return swap, on each payment date,

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,210
the total rate of return payer must pay the receiver

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,600
the entire return on the notional value of the reference

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,020
asset since the last reset or payment date.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,010
This includes any interest or dividend payments, and also

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,980
any capital gain or loss.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,390
The total return can therefore be negative.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,570
And in exchange for that total rate of return,

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,050
the receiver pays an interest rate, usually based

20
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,470
on a floating reference rate such as LIBOR or SOFR.

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,890
And there may be a spread over that reference rate.

22
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,330
As with most swaps, usually only the net amount is transferred.

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,000


24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,580
As with other swaps, total rate of return swaps

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,470
have a fixed maturity date.

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,650
That maturity date might not be equal to the reference asset,

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,290
and therefore the swaps allow flexibility

28
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,170
in length of the exposure to the reference asset

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,390
without requiring any transaction

30
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,940
involving the asset itself.

31
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,130
The reference asset, as I mentioned before,

32
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,410
could be just about anything where returns

33
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,420
are observable and verifiable.

34
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,360
They could be bonds, loans, emerging market equities,

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,810
sovereign debt, mortgage backed securities, equities,

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,330
commodities, and so forth.

37
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,050
Note too that the payer need not own the reference asset.

38
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,710
If the payer does own the asset, the swap

39
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,320
offloads the risk onto the receiver and serves as a hedge.

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,949
When the payer doesn't own the reference asset,

41
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,310
the swap is effectively a speculative short position

42
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,760
on the asset, a bet that the total return

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,490
will be less than the interest rate paid in the contract.

44
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,350


45
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,490
As a quick comprehension check, let's consider the example

46
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,450
of a total rate of return swap with notional principle

47
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,880
of $10 million where the receiver pays LIBOR flat.

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,570
Assume that the reference asset earned negative 10%

49
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,510
over the period since the last reset date,

50
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,856
and that the LIBOR rate on the last reset date was 4.5%.

51
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,770
What's the net cash flow on the swap?

52
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,600


53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,200
The answer is that the total rate of return payer

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,956
pays minus 10% and receives 4.5%.

55
00:03:02,956 --> 00:03:08,350
Paying minus 10% is the same as receiving 10%.

56
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:15,930
So in total, the total rate of return payer receives 14.5%.

57
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,240
The total rate of return receiver loses 14.5%.

58
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,800
The swap is zero-sum.

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,310


60
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,230
Total rate of return swap pricing

61
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,780
is surprisingly straightforward, because we

62
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,270
can break down the swap into pieces

63
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,090
that are each easy to price.

64
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,260
From the payer's perspective, initially and at the beginning

65
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,560
of every subsequent reset date, the swap

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,800
is equivalent to a short position in the risky reference

67
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,370
asset, and the long position in a floating rate

68
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,100
bond, in amounts equal to the notional principle.

69
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,860
From the receiver's perspective, it's

70
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,610
like being long in a risky reference asset and short

71
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,970
in the floating rate bond, both again of equal value.

72
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,760
This implies that the net value of the swap

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,360
is always zero at a reset date.

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,910
Between reset dates, the value will

75
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,000
fluctuate with changes in the present value of the reference

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,005
asset and with the present value of the floating rate bond.

77
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:27,710


78
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,960
It's useful to understand a little bit more

79
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,680
about the ways in which these contracts are commonly used.

80
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,020
Let's start with the motivations of total rate

81
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,550
of return receivers.

82
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,280
These are often hedge funds seeking exposures

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,460
to an asset class that may be illiquid or otherwise

84
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,420
difficult to access directly.

85
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,690
Financial institutions may also use these swaps

86
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,330
to obtain a particular risk exposure

87
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,360
that they prefer to keep off their balance sheets.

88
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,780
Generally, indirect exposure through a swap contract

89
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,680
may be less costly in terms of administrative and transactions

90
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,660
costs.

91
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,980
For example, imagine a hedge fund manager

92
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,910
that would like to gain exposure to equities in an emerging

93
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,540
market.

94
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,010
But that market may have strict capital controls

95
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,310
and very weak protection for foreign investors.

96
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,350
Through a total rate of return swap,

97
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,980
the manager can benefit from the expected gains from the risk

98
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,250
exposure while avoiding the costs and risks

99
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,030
of physical ownership.

100
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,700
A feature that makes total rate of return swaps

101
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,300
attractive, particularly to hedge funds, but also sometimes

102
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,820
dangerous, is the very high leverage

103
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,660
implicit in these contracts.

104
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,270
As for other derivatives, the implicit leverage

105
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,320
is reduced when capital is required to ensure performance,

106
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,860
as we'll see in the next example.

107
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,560
It's easiest to understand the implicit leverage

108
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,170
in a total rate of return swap from the perspective

109
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,630
of the receiver with an example.

110
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,610
Imagine that Hedge Fund A here is the total rate of return

111
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,020
receiver where the underlying asset has an expected

112
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,290
annual rate of return of 8.3%.

113
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,960


114
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,660
The current one year LIBOR rate is 5.8%,

115
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,890
implying that the spread over LIBOR on the risky reference

116
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,220
asset is 2.5%.

117
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,750


118
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,420
The total rate of return payer receives

119
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,090
LIBOR plus a spread of 1%, indicated here with a spread

120
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,695
to LIBOR of 1%.

121
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:51,940


122
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,880
The expected net spread over LIBOR for the receiver

123
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,190
then is 8.3% minus 1% minus 5.8%, or 1.5%.

124
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,450


125
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,340
Let's further assume that the hedge fund

126
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,900
has to put up 5% of the notional principal and collateral, which

127
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,290
from its perspective ties up that amount of its own equity

128
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,620
capital.

129
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,925
Then the implicit leverage is 100 to 5, or 20 to 1.

130
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:29,210


131
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,190
The collateral also earns interest

132
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,440
for the receiver while it's being held,

133
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,813
which is assumed here to be at the LIBOR rate of 5.8%.

134
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:40,080


135
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
Under those assumptions, the net expected return

136
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,650
is a very high 35.8%.

137
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,040
That estimate comes from the equation on the slide,

138
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,130
showing in the first term the expected total rate of return

139
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,570
on the reference asset of 8.3%, the interest payment

140
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,340
on the swap based on LIBOR plus 1%, or 6.8%,

141
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,840
and the LIBOR return on the collateral.

142
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,300
The reason that the total return is so high

143
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,900
is that it's based on the notional principle of 100,

144
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:17,440
but the equity tied up is just the collateral of 5 per 100.

145
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,640
This is then a highly leveraged position and a very risky one.

146
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,470
If the return on the reference asset

147
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,660
turns out to be lower than expected,

148
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,300
losses could turn out to be very large.

149
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,990
The second and third column of the table

150
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,559
confirmed that it's the leverage that creates

151
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,450
the high expected return.

152
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,990
If Hedge Fund B faces the same terms,

153
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,370
except that a collateral of 10% is required,

154
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,340
then the net expected return is 20.8% rather than

155
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,420
35.8 doing the same algebra.

156
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,240
And of course, for a cash investor

157
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,340
in the same asset with no leverage,

158
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,440
the expected return is 8.3%.

159
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,800


160
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Finally, let's consider the possible motivations

161
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,630
of a total rate of return payer.

162
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,000
We've seen that the payer's position involves

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
a short position in the reference asset.

164
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,990
If the payer has a long cash position in that same asset,

165
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,570
the swap hedges that exposure.

166
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,550
Of course, an alternative way to hedge that cash exposure would

167
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,810
be to just liquidate the asset but an outright sale

168
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,740
could be undesirable for various reasons, such as high selling

169
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,050
costs or tax consequences.

170
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,630
Well, for an entity that doesn't own the reference asset

171
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,660
but believes its price is likely to drop,

172
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,030
the total rate of return swap offers a way

173
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,330
to take a short position.

174
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,490
If the price decline is expected to be temporary,

175
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,155
the maturity of the swap can be easily matched to that belief.

176
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:03,820


177
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,610
Being a payer in a total rate of return swap

178
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,700
is also very useful if an outright short position

179
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,600
is prohibited, either by policy or regulation,

180
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,230
or if it's hard to borrow an asset in order to short it.

181
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,860
Some of these scenarios that I've just described amount

182
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,670
to an accounting or regulatory arbitrage that's

183
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:31,120
using a derivative to get around a rule or regulation.

184
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,060
Whether such opportunities actually exist

185
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,610
is not assured, as regulators are

186
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,470
aware of these sorts of loopholes

187
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,135
and often try to close them down.

188
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:42,730


189
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,090
In any case, we've seen that a total rate of return swap

190
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,180
is a powerful tool for customizing and managing

191
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,130
risk exposures.

192
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,710
As with other swap products, most users

193
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,100
are financial institutions or large financial firms,

194
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,210
rather than individual investors.
