00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,800
PROFESSOR: One very popular futures

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,970
contract is the S&P 500 e-mini contract that's

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:12,400
traded at the CME electronically through its Globex platform.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,130
As the name suggests, it's a contract

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,730
that has a payoff linked to the value of the S&P 500 stock

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,050
index.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,910
The long side of the contract gains

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,720
when the S&P 500 index rises and conversely, the short side

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,470
wins if the price of the S&P 500 index falls.

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,930
You can learn about the contract's details

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,230
by going to the link shown on this slide.

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,590
The contract allows traders to obtain highly leveraged longer

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,790
short exposure to the S&P 500 using a liquid contract that's

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,920
cash-settled.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,110
The contract is described as mini

16
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:53,330
because it's based on just $50 times the S&P 500 Index value,

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,400
making it attractive even to non-institutional traders.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,940
The futures price for an S&P 500 futures contract

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,770
will be determined by the forward price

20
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,560
formula for stocks with a continuous dividend that

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,250
was introduced last time.

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,280
The futures price will depend on the current level

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,510
of the index, the risk-free interest rate, and the dividend

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,260
yield on the S&P 500.

25
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,930
Because the interest rate and dividend yield

26
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,080
tend to be fairly stable over time,

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,260
the primary factor affecting the contract price

28
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:35,350
and its movements are changes in the spot S&P 500 Index.

29
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,870
The snapshot of information shown here

30
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,860
is available online and updated very frequently.

31
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,140
You can see that there are listed contracts

32
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,810
that expire every three months, and that trading

33
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,490
is most active in the contract that's closest to expiration.

34
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,540
In this case, that's the March 2021 contract.

35
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,690
Options on the futures contracts are also available,

36
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,625
and we'll discuss those in a future class.

37
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,920


38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,170
It's interesting to look at a new contract

39
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,169
and the motivations behind introducing it.

40
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,510
Several exchanges, including the CME,

41
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,510
have recently launched Bitcoin futures.

42
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,090
From the perspective, both of the exchange

43
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,190
and of market participants, introducing

44
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,250
this product has many attractive features.

45
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,400
Clearly, there's great investor interest in Bitcoin,

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,610
both among individual traders and, more recently,

47
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,370
among financial institutions.

48
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,220
And whereas trading directly in Bitcoin can be problematic,

49
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,630
the futures contracts provide Bitcoin exposure

50
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,330
without having to physically invest in it.

51
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,490
That is, the contract is cash-settled in dollars,

52
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,170
and so doesn't involve any direct Bitcoin transactions.

53
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,860
In addition, it allows investors to take short positions

54
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,970
in Bitcoin, something that's difficult or perhaps impossible

55
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,300
in the current cash market.

56
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,880
Introducing a Bitcoin contract also

57
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,720
created some risks and challenges for the exchange.

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,120
Because there isn't a single reliable source

59
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,610
for Bitcoin spot price quotations,

60
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,070
pricing could be distorted.

61
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,870
The high volatility of Bitcoin makes

62
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,420
trading in the futures contracts very risky,

63
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,020
especially for small and inexperienced traders.

64
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,940
That creates some reputational risk

65
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,090
for the exchange, which could be seen as taking advantage

66
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,410
of unsophisticated investors.

67
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,950
And as with any new product, there's

68
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,280
the risk that demand for it just won't be there.

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,560
But as it turns out, Bitcoin futures

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,960
are proving to be very popular.

71
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,280
Similar to the S&P 500 contract, the greatest volume

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,380
is in the contract closest to expiration.

73
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,400
Note that volume measures the number of contracts that

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,190
are traded in a single day.

75
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,860
A related statistic that's also shown here

76
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,200
is called open interest.

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,080
Open interest is a measure of the total number

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,320
of outstanding contracts, and it's

79
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,500
interpreted as a measure of the depth of the market.

80
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,000
