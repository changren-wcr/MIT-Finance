1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,230
PROFESSOR: Next, we're going to turn

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,780
to some other important types of swaps.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,650
We'll start with a deep dive into currency swaps.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,950
After interest rates, the second most widely used type

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,100
of swap contract involves periodically exchanging

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,360
a payment in one currency for a payment in a second currency.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,730
These are known as currency or FX swaps.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,380


9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,150
A currency swap contract may call

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,350
for fixed or floating payments or a combination of the two.

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,570
As for interest rate swaps, there's

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,060
some underlying principle amount that determines

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,630
the size of the payments.

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,720
But whereas for interest rates the principle is notional

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,510
and never exchanged between the two counterparties,

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,210
with currency swaps the contract may also

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,040
call for an exchange of principle

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,850
in the two currencies.

19
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,690
A fixed-for-fixed currency swap is like a portfolio

20
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,120
of forward currency contracts.

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,550
As such, these contracts are widely

22
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,730
used by corporations and financial institutions

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,950
to hedge currency exposures arising

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,940
from international trade and cross-border borrowing

25
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,220
and lending transactions.

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,310


27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,750
Let's go back to our example of a US exporter hedging currency

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,640
risk exposure.

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,160
But now imagine that instead of receiving a lump

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,000
sum of 5 million euros in six months from its client,

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,070
the agreement calls for the client making

32
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,360
five equal installment payments of 1 million euros paid

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,610
every six months for the next 2 and 1/2 years.

34
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,370
The exporter could hedge each individual installment

35
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,790
with a separate currency futures or forward contract.

36
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,630
Alternatively, a single currency swap contract

37
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,640
could be used to hedge the exposure.

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,760
Well, let's first review how we can find the forward rates that

39
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,220
would be locked in for each installment payment

40
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,740
individually.

41
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,810
Recall that the initial spot exchange

42
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,350
rate was assumed to be $1.2673 per euro,

43
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,530
that the dollar interest rate is 5%,

44
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,170
and that the euro interest rate is 3%.

45
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,910
And let's assume the term structure

46
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,420
is flat at these rates in both currencies.

47
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,670
With this information, we can use our formula

48
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,670
for the forward exchange rate for future delivery dates

49
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,620
in six months, one year, et cetera,

50
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,780
going out 2 and 1/2 years.

51
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,420
You should check that you agree with the outcomes that

52
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,575
are listed in this table.

53
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:35,740


54
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,360
Alternatively, the US firm can hedge with a currency swap.

55
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,050
The swap could specify that the firm pays 1 million euros

56
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,980
every six months for 2 and 1/2 years to a bank counterparty

57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,670
in exchange for a pre-specified swap rate of k,

58
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,850
where we'll say K is 1.306.

59
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,460
And we'll see where the 1.306 comes

60
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,190
from in just a little while.

61
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,380
Well, what's the net dollar cash flow

62
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,600
for the US firm on each date?

63
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,060
That's determined by a combination of the swap

64
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,310
transactions and selling the euro's

65
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,960
received in the spot market.

66
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,500


67
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,920
Specifically, at each swap payment date

68
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,940
the firm receives a million times K dollars in exchange

69
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,200
for giving up 1 million euros.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,480
The euros paid in the swap are worth a million euros

71
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,460
times the spot exchange rate, S sub T, of dollars per euro.

72
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,650
The net amount received in the swamp

73
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:45,320
which is cash settled then is a million times K minus S sub T.

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,710
The firm also sells the million euros received

75
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,320
from its client in the spot market

76
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,320
at the current exchange rate, S sub T again.

77
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,950
The net inflow to the firm is a certain one million

78
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:05,900
times the fixed swap rate, K.

79
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,580
We took the swap rate in this example to be 1.306.

80
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,030
Now let's see where that number actually comes from.

81
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,120
I think you won't be surprised to hear that it's nailed down

82
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,260
by a no-arbitrage condition, in this case between currency

83
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,680
forward rates and currency swap rates.

84
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,410
As for interest rate swaps and other forwards and futures

85
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,170
contracts, the initial value of the swap

86
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,460
must be 0 from the perspective of both counterparties.

87
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,625
The swap rate K is chosen to make that happen.

88
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,460


89
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,480
To infer the rate K, we can set up a portfolio with two pieces.

90
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,790
The first swap of 1 million euros for $1 million

91
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,160
times K dollars.

92
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,100
We know from before that the payoff in dollar terms

93
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,080
at each future date, T is one million times

94
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,410
K minus the spot rate on that date.

95
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,050
The second piece of this portfolio

96
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,270
is a set of forward contracts that

97
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,980
specify an exchange of a million times

98
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,735
the forward exchange rate at time T

99
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:21,460
dollars for a million euros on each of those future payment

100
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,450
dates also.

101
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,150
In dollar terms, the euros received

102
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,880
in the forward contract at each payment date

103
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,930
will be worth 1 million times the spot exchange rate.

104
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:38,430


105
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,040
Putting these two components together,

106
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,650
the portfolio payoff at every payment date

107
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:52,270
simplifies just to $1 million times K minus the forward rate.

108
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,300
Well, now notice that the payoffs are certain dollar

109
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,470
amounts.

110
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,290
We know K We know those forward rates.

111
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,140
And hence, we can value them by discounting

112
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,780
at the risk-free rate along the yield curve

113
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,460
for the appropriate maturity.

114
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,320
The present value of the cash flows

115
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,530
can then be written as the discounted sum shown

116
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,100
on this slide, where we've represented the discount rates

117
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,690
here on a continuous basis.

118
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,630


119
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,580
We also know that because it's free to enter

120
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,220
the forward position and the swap position,

121
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,650
the value of the portfolio must be equal to 0.

122
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,130
So we can set the expression for the present value

123
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,660
of the portfolio equal to 0, rearrange it,

124
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,845
and solve for the fixed swap rate K that makes it true.

125
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:47,220


126
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,410
Looking at this resulting formula,

127
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,870
we can see that K is a present value

128
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,180
weighted average of the forward exchange

129
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,295
rates on future payment dates.

130
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:59,760


131
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,970
That expression for K can be represented entirely

132
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,640
in terms of dollar and euro interest rates

133
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,850
by substituting the formula for the forward rate

134
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,490
for each payment date into the expression we just

135
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,670
derived for K. This representation leads

136
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,810
to the interpretation that the currency swap rate equals

137
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,450
the current exchange rate multiplied

138
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,990
by an expression based on a ratio

139
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,260
of the relative risk-free borrowing costs in the two

140
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,980
currencies.

141
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,610


142
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,100
I want to revisit the comparison between hedging

143
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,680
using a sequence of forward contracts

144
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,050
and with a single swap.

145
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,530
Both methods completely eliminate the exchange rate

146
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,860
uncertainty, and both generate cash flows

147
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,600
with identical present values.

148
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,440
However, the two strategies differ in their cash flow

149
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,730
profiles.

150
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,990
Whereas the swap provides level payments,

151
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,950
the forward contract initially locks in lower cash flows

152
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,400
and later on higher ones.

153
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,790
One's preference for one pattern of cash flows over the other

154
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,390
might influence the choice between the contracts.

155
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,000
Other considerations in choosing between them

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,150
include any differences in transactions costs,

157
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,250
availability, and collateral requirements.
