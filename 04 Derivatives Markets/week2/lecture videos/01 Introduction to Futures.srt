00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,755
PROFESSOR: Like all forward contracts,

1
00:00:01,755 --> 00:00:03,960
a futures contract locks in a price

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,750
today for a transaction that will occur on a specified

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,740
future date.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,560
Futures contracts, though, have a number of special features

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,560
that are designed to enhance liquidity and minimize trading

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,700
costs.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,420
First, the contracts are traded on an exchange

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,190
like the well-known Chicago Mercantile

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,050
Exchange, the CME, or the Intercontinental Exchange, ICE.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,660
The Exchange clears all trades and acts

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,689
as what's called the central counterparty, eliminating

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,780
bilateral default risk between individual traders

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,380
and preserving the anonymity between traders.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,490
Second, the contracts are highly standardized.

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,310
For example, a futures contract for wheat

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,030
specifies the particular variety of the wheat,

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,370
how many bushels of wheat are included

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,750
in the contract, delivery dates and locations, contract price

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,660
increments, and so forth.

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,230
This standardization across this relatively small number

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,100
of contracts has the advantage that it concentrates volume

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,100
and thereby increases contract liquidity.

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,140
The disadvantage is that the match

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,290
between a contract and the asset being hedged often

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,800
is then imperfect.

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,010
That is, futures contracts are often used to cross hedge,

27
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,180
giving rise to the basis risk that we talked about last time.

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,720
Just to give an example, imagine a farmer who's

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,630
hedging her durum wheat crop might

30
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,110
choose to hedge with a short position in a contract

31
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,160
based on soft red winter wheat because the price

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,050
changes between those two types of wheats

33
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,430
are highly correlated.

34
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,920
But there's only a futures contract

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,100
on the red winter wheat.

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,280
The basis risk then is that the prices

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,760
of durum wheat and red wheat may not move in tandem,

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,250
and that will reduce the effectiveness of the hedge.

39
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,550
A third special feature of futures contracts

40
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,530
is that they're marked to market at least once

41
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,740
every day in a process known as daily settlement.

42
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,440
A trader entering into a futures contract

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,220
must put up margin in the form of cash for securities.

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,220
The margin is held as collateral by the Exchange.

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,460
And as the futures price for the contract changes,

46
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,830
the daily gains or loss are transferred

47
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,380
between the accounts of the corresponding long and short

48
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,120
positions.

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,660
If a trader's margin account falls below a threshold

50
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,910
level called the maintenance margin,

51
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,160
the trader must add additional margin

52
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,750
or the Exchange will close out the position.

53
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,820
The combination of margin requirements

54
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,240
and daily settlement greatly reduce the credit risk exposure

55
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,850
of the Exchange and protect market participants

56
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,800
against default risk.

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,990
As it turns out, most futures contracts

58
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,110
are closed out prior to maturity.

59
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,460
That could be for several reasons.

60
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,700
One is that the horizon over which

61
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,820
the risk needs to be managed is different than the contract

62
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,950
maturity.

63
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,200
Contracts may also be closed out early

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,540
to avoid physical settlement.

65
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,930
Going back to our wheat example, a trader

66
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,500
might want to speculate on higher than expected demand

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,770
or bad weather causing wheat prices to rise,

68
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,200
but the speculator doesn't want to take delivery

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,960
of $5,000 bushels of wheat.

70
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,750
Contracts are closed out prior to expiration

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,450
by taking an offsetting position in the same contract.

72
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,540
For instance, if you're long in 10 corn contracts

73
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,870
expiring in April, you can take a short position

74
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,090
and 10 identical contracts.

75
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,940
The Exchange has a record of both transactions.

76
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,620
And they cancel against each other

77
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,500
through the clearing process.

78
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,000
