1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,830
PROFESSOR: Before we move on, it's worthwhile for us

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,800
to go over some of the mechanics of futures markets in a little

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,160
more detail.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,920
Remember that traders and futures

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,370
have to post margin that serves as insurance that they'll

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,810
honor their commitments under the contract.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,910
Gains and losses are settled daily

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,200
between the long and short sides of the contract.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,590
Example 2.5 here shows how this works

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,920
in the context of a December gold futures contract.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,490
Let's consider an investor who takes a long position in two

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,830
of these contracts.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,100
Assume that each contract is for 100 ounces of gold,

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,270
and that the futures price is $1,250 per ounce

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,790
on the date when the investor enters the contract.

16
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,070
The initial margin requirement is

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,160
set by the exchange at $6,000 per contract.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,390
So the margin requirement initially is $12,000 in total.

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,240
There's also something called a maintenance margin

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,190
of $4,500 per contract, which represents the minimum that

21
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,320
must be maintained in each trader's margin

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,475
account over time.

23
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:17,200


24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,180
More generally, margin requirements

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,260
are going to differ across different types of contracts,

26
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,660
and they'll be set depending on the volatility

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,070
of the underlying asset and the contract size.

28
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,290
This table shows how the balance in the margin

29
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,040
account evolves over time is a function of a particular path

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,280
of futures settlement prices.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,250
At the end of the first day, the price has decreased to $1,241,

32
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:53,160
from the initial price of $1,250 per ounce.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,300
The loss on a long position is the difference

34
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:02,570
of $1,250 minus $1,241, times the 100 ounces in a contract,

35
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,970
or $900 per contract.

36
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,080
The total loss is $1,800 then, on the two contracts.

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,720


38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,880
Correspondingly, the margin balance

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:23,930
goes from the initial $12,000 down to $10,200, corresponding

40
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,780
to the $1,800 loss.

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,710
The remaining $10,200 is higher than the required

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,740
total maintenance margin of $9,000,

43
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,730
so no additional funds are required.

44
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,840
Now let's go forward to day six and assume the settlement price

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,350
is $1,236.20 per ounce.

46
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:57,020
That implies a margin balance of $9,240.

47
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,530
That's also consistent with subtracting the cumulative loss

48
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,890
up to that date from the initial margin.

49
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,910
Well now, a further price drop on day seven

50
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,320
implies a further loss of $1,260.

51
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,480
This brings the margin account down to $7,980,

52
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,160
and that's below the maintenance margin of $9,000.

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,320
To maintain an open position, the trader

54
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,270
has to deposit an additional $4,020 into the margin account

55
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:41,200
to restore it to the initial margin requirement of $12,000.

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,630
The margin account continues to rise and fall

57
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,690
with the price of gold and you can

58
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,770
imagine the position is closed out on day 16

59
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:57,710
at the then current price of $1,226.90 per ounce.

60
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,220
The trader withdraws the remaining money

61
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,180
in the margin account.

62
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,950


63
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,560
We've seen that futures exchanges, which

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,560
serve as clearing houses and central counterparties,

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,450
or CCPs, play a central role in futures markets.

66
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,420
This diagram goes a little more deeply into the structure

67
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,880
of a futures trade.

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,760
A retail futures trader would typically place a buy

69
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,380
or sell order through a broker, who in turn would submit it

70
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,480
to a clearing member.

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,570
The clearing house member, which is often

72
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,760
a large financial institution, would

73
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,070
execute the trade via the clearing house

74
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,800
with another clearing member, representing

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,170
the client wanting to enter the other side of the same trade.

76
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,020
The margin accounts would be kept in safekeeping

77
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,680
at the clearing house.

78
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,380
Default risk is minimal, not only

79
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,030
because of the margin accounts, which

80
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,700
we've talked about before, but also

81
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,460
because of the added protection from capital reserves

82
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,210
held by the clearing house and the contractual obligation

83
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,730
of clearing members to absorb residual losses.

84
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,710


85
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,760
During the severe 2008 financial crisis,

86
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,970
heightened counterparty risk and concern about default

87
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,270
caused severe market disruptions and price spikes.

88
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,090
To try to avoid those problems arising in the future,

89
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,970
regulators required that many common derivatives

90
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,390
transactions, that traditionally had been conducted

91
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,450
in bilateral over-the-counter markets,

92
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,520
be moved into clearinghouses where

93
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,340
default risk is much lower.

94
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,730
Those changes have probably made the markets safer overall.

95
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,770
However, the concentration of trades

96
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,890
into a limited number of large clearing houses

97
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,530
has made those institutions themselves

98
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,680
a source of systemic risk and a target

99
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,525
for tighter regulatory scrutiny.

100
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,930


101
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,380
I've emphasized that futures contracts are a particular type

102
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,730
of forward contract.

103
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,620
A natural question you might have

104
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,750
is whether the special institutions

105
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,470
of futures markets, particularly the requirements of posting

106
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,020
margin and marking to market daily,

107
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,530
has any effect on the relative price of otherwise similar

108
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,830
forward and futures contracts.

109
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,110
As a practical matter, the formulas

110
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,540
that we derive for the price and forward contracts

111
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,600
are commonly used for futures contracts too.

112
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,390
Theoretically, one can prove that the two prices

113
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,000
should be identical in a constant interest rate

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,410
environment.

115
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,180
When interest rates aren't constant,

116
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,630
small differences arise because of margin account dynamics

117
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,510
and the correlation between the value of the underlying asset

118
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,400
and interest rates.

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,700
Those differences are greater in high interest rate environments

120
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,070
and smaller when forward contracts also

121
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,870
are collateralized.

122
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,210
For the purpose of this class, and also

123
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,120
in most practical situations, the prices

124
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,470
can be treated as essentially identical.

125
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,000
