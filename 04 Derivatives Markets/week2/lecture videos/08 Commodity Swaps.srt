00:00:01,176 --> 00:00:03,700
PROFESSOR: Commodity swaps are another useful tool

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,350
for risk management.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,650
A commodity swap is an agreement to periodically exchange

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,060
a pre-specified fixed payment for a payment linked

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,520
to the current market price of a commodity.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,820
That makes these swaps equivalent to a portfolio

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,100
of commodity forward contracts, each

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,290
with the same forward price.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,480
These agreements are usually cash-settled,

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,500
although a contract could specify physical delivery.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,410
Because oil is an important input into many products,

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,870
and because its price can be very volatile,

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,420
commodity swaps based on oil prices are quite common.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,040
Let's consider a company that will

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,990
need to buy 100,000 barrels of oil in one and two years.

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,080
We know that there's active forwards in the futures markets

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,290
in oil, and let's assume that in those markets today,

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,630
we can see that the forward price of oil

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,890
is $110 per barrel for delivery in one year,

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,720
and it's $111 per barrel for delivery in two years.

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,470
Also, let's assume that the one and two year interest rates

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,150
are 6% and 6.5% respectively, both on a simple interest rate

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,210
basis.

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,890
From this information, then we know

25
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,590
that using forwards or futures the company can lock

26
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,550
in a purchase price per barrel needed over the next two years,

27
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:31,380
for a present value cost of $201.638.

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,440
That comes from discounting the first year price we lock in

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,980
per barrel at the one year 6% rate,

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,740
and the two year price we said we could lock in

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,560
at the 6.5% rate.

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,320
Using the now familiar no-arbitrage reasoning

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,540
that a swap must lock in prices that

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,140
are consistent in present value terms with what can be locked

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,130
in forward contracts, and recognizing

36
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,480
that a swap typically calls for level fixed payments,

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,815
we can solve for x in this equation to get the swap rate.

38
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:09,120


39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,080
You can verify the two year no-arbitrage swap

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,840
price per barrel is $110.483.

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,970
This example is also a convenient setup

42
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,280
to demonstrate that swaps are equivalent to a package

43
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,060
in forward contracts coupled with borrowing and lending

44
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,990
money.

45
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,550
Consider the swap price of $110.483 per barrel,

46
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,710
versus the forward prices, which we saw

47
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,260
were $110 for delivery in one year

48
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,900
and $111 for delivery in two years per barrel.

49
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,690
Relative to this forward curve, we're

50
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,130
overpaying $0.483 at the end of the first year,

51
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,710
and we're underpaying $0.571 at the end of the second year.

52
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,710
Thus, by entering into the swap, we're

53
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,380
effectively lending the counterparty money

54
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,330
for one year, starting at the end of the first year.

55
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,900
The implied interest rate on this implicit loan

56
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:18,900
is the 0.517 divided by 0.483, minus 1, which gives us 7%.

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,730


58
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,600
We also had the information that the one and two year

59
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,690
zero coupon bond yields were 6% and 6.5% respectively.

60
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,910
You can calculate the implied forward rate

61
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,330
from this information between years 1 and 2,

62
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,620
and you'll find that it's also 7%.

63
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,180
You should verify that for yourself.

64
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,250
This highlights a general property

65
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,270
with swaps, which is that fairly priced swaps have embedded

66
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,440
borrowing and lending rates equal to the implied forward

67
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,590
rates and the yield curve.

68
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,500
Consistency of forward and swap contract

69
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,650
prices with implied forward rates in the yield curve

70
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,170
is another no-arbitrage relationship

71
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,830
that must always hold, at least within transaction's cost

72
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,970
bounds.

73
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,580
This oil swap example is also a good place

74
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,029
to pause and confirm that physical settlement of a swap

75
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,660
contract is equivalent to financial settlement paired

76
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,080
with particular cash transactions.

77
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,340
With physical settlement on each payment date, in this example,

78
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,990
the specified quantity of oil is exchanged for the fixed swap

79
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,490
price.

80
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,940


81
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,220
The buyer receives the oil and pays $110.483 per barrel

82
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,650
under the contract.

83
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,580
Now with financial settlement, the amount

84
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,970
of cash received by the oil buyer in the swap

85
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,460
will be the difference between the spot

86
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,120
price at an exchange date, which is stochastic,

87
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,785
and the fixed swap price.

88
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:06,760


89
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,350
The oil buyer can then go and buy the oil on the same day

90
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:18,040
in the spot market, paying the spot price.

91
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,370
The gain or loss on the swap just

92
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,640
offsets the difference between the spot price of oil

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,010
and the fixed swap price.

94
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,890
And on net, the oil buyer winds up paying $110.482 per barrel

95
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,460
on each payment date.

96
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,000
