1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,320
PROFESSOR: One of the most common uses of swaps

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,300
is by financial institutions that

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,150
want to hedge the maturity mismatch between the asset

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,550
and liability sides of their balance sheet.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,660
We'll consider the example of Southwest Savings Bank.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,430
This is one of my favorite examples

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,530
for illustrating the importance of interest rate

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,430
risk for banks, how swaps and futures are alternative ways

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,120
to hedge against it, and how swap contracts have been

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,910
engineered and evolved over time to better help

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,140
banks address these goals.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,050
Like many savings banks, Southwest

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,620
can fund its investment relatively inexpensively using

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,020
short term deposit funding.

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,420
Depositors like the safety and liquidity

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,550
of holding their money in a bank.

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,420
Thus, deposits make up the majority of its liabilities.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,610
It also has some equity that serves

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,470
as a buffer against fluctuations in the value of its assets.

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,680
On the asset side of the balance sheet,

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,500
it specializes in funding mortgages,

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,065
which let's assume have a maturity of 10 years.

23
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:15,990


24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,870
Well, let's imagine that the managers of Southwest

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:25,350
decide to invest $1 million into new 10 year mortgages funded

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,520
with three month time deposits.

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,240
Say the mortgages carry a 10% interest rate,

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,180
and the three month time deposits earn 8%.

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,980
For the first three months, the bank

30
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,770
has locked in an attractive 2% spread

31
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,540
between the mortgage rate it earns

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,940
and the deposit rate it pays.

33
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,970
Clearly, though, this is a very risky balance sheet.

34
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,700
The risk can be understood by considering the future cash

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,730
flows.

36
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,670
If interest rates rise, the mortgages

37
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,060
will continue to pay 10%, but the new deposits

38
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,360
will carry a higher rate, possibly exceeding the 10%

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,600
earned on the mortgages.

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,170
The risk can also be understood as having an immediate effect

41
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,259
in terms of the market value or present value of the balance

42
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,930
sheet.

43
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,410
That is, if rates rise, the market value of the 10 year

44
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,480
mortgages will fall considerably more

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,140
than the market value of the three month time deposits.

46
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,390
That means that an increase in interest rates

47
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,120
will erode the value of equity, potentially

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,150
causing financial distress or causing the bank

49
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,190
to be in violation of regulatory capital requirements.

50
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,060
There are several ways to hedge this risk exposure.

51
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,080
We'll compare two popular approaches: futures contracts

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,325
and interest rate swaps.

53
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:46,640


54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,580
Hedging with a strip of short term interest rate futures

55
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,160
is one way to offset Southwest's interest rate risk exposure.

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,580
Active short term interest rate futures contract currently

57
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,500
include the three month LIBOR and three month SOFR contracts.

58
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,080
Looking at the information in this table,

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,080
the quoted price is used to find the forward interest

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,750
rate that can be locked in.

61
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,530
The annualized rate is just 100 minus the quoted price.

62
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,880
So if the price is given as 92, the rate is 8%.

63
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,290


64
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,570
Well, to lock in future borrowing rates

65
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,600
beyond the first three months covered by the initial time

66
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,040
deposits, the bank would short a sequence of contracts,

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,040
sizing the position to minimize the risk with a hedge ratio.

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,770
The short position generates gains

69
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,200
proportional to the increase in rates

70
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,150
offsetting the future higher interest

71
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,920
rates in the cash market and the losses that they generate.

72
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,680
Specifically, if the contract is based

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,320
on a principal amount of $1 million,

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,660
the bank would short one of each of these contracts.

75
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,300
While this strategy can provide a decent hedge,

76
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,200
it has some drawbacks.

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,300
One is that it involves a large number of contracts.

78
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,510
The second is that liquidity tends to decline rapidly

79
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,589
for longer dated contracts, as can be seen from the declining

80
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,240
open interest.

81
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,000
That reduced liquidity may increase the cost of the hedge.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,660
Hedging mortgages is also complicated by the fact

83
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,400
that they may be prepaid.

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,530
And there is considerable uncertainty

85
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,500
about what that rate of prepayment will be.

86
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,890
That uncertainty will degrade the effectiveness of the hedge,

87
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,200
because it's likely that the hedge will turn out

88
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,210
to be too big or too small.

89
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,160


90
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,710
An alternative is for Southwest to hedge using

91
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,230
a 10 year interest rate swap.

92
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,860
Southwest would enter as the fixed rate payer, using

93
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,660
the income received from the mortgages

94
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,870
to cover its swap payout obligations.

95
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,880
It would be the floating rate receiver

96
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,350
and would use the income from the swap to pay its depositors.

97
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,710
It's protected from rising deposit rates by the increasing

98
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,310
swap income from the floating payments it receives.

99
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,590
Specifically, imagine that it enters

100
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,840
into a 10 year swap that matches the maturity of the mortgages.

101
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,690
As the fixed rate payer, it pays a rate

102
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,730
that was determined competitively

103
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,680
in the swap market, as we discussed earlier.

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,300
The floating rate is indexed to LIBOR, a common index

105
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,960
rate for swaps, and the payment frequency

106
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,830
is set to be semi-annual, which is also

107
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,160
a common frequency for plain vanilla interest rate swaps.

108
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,300


109
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,900
Both the strip of short futures and the interest rate swap

110
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,900
would serve to protect the bank from rising interest rates.

111
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,570
However, the swap contract has a few advantages over futures.

112
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,820
There's only one swap contract.

113
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,450
It covers the entire 10 year period, avoiding illiquidity

114
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,110
and long dated futures, and the more flexible timing

115
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,570
means that the contract can better match the maturity

116
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,840
dates of the time deposits.

117
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,170
However, this plain vanilla swap is still not a perfect hedge

118
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,410
for Southwest.

119
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,610
Whereas the notional principle of the swap is constant,

120
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,340
the mortgage principal will decline over time

121
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,350
with amortization.

122
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,800
There's likely to be a mismatch between the timing of mortgage

123
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,320
payments that are received monthly

124
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,980
and the swap payments that are made semi-annually.

125
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,930
The rate paid to depositors may not track the LIBOR reference

126
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,890
rate in the swap.

127
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,170
The uncertainty about prepayment speeds

128
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,080
means the bank is likely to be over- or under-hedged

129
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,665
in the future.

130
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:54,300


131
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,830
All of these problems can be addressed with customized swaps

132
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,530
that use financial engineering to provide users

133
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,810
with a more reliable hedge.

134
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,070
Amortizing swaps are based on a notional principle balance

135
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,330
that declines over time.

136
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,630
In this case, the amortization schedule

137
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,580
can be set to match the normal mortgage amortization schedule.

138
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,490
Basis swaps are an exchange of payments

139
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,780
where each side is based on a different reference index.

140
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,390
A basis swap could be used to hedge

141
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,330
the timing difference between the mortgage cash inflows

142
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,420
and the swap fixed rate outflows.

143
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,450
Another basis swap could be used to hedge

144
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,260
the difference between the deposit rates and the LIBOR

145
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,240
rates.

146
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,270
Finally, the prepayment risk could be hedged

147
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,750
with the use of a swaption.

148
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,070
A swaption is an option embedded in a swap contract.

149
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,730
Type of swaption that would help Southwest in this situation

150
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,160
would allow it to cancel the swap

151
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,460
at any time of its choosing, thereby

152
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,270
allowing it to take off the hedge if the mortgages are

153
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,490
prepaid.

154
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,860
While each of these custom features

155
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,320
makes for a much better hedge, but it

156
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
adds to the cost of the hedge.

157
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,700
Depending on its risk tolerance, Southwest

158
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,360
might prefer the partial protection offered

159
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,450
by a plain vanilla interest rate swap,

160
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,380
or it may choose to add some of these other features

161
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,580
to improve the quality of its hedge.

162
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,000
