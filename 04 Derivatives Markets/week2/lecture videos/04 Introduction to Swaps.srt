1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,780
PROFESSOR: As usual, let's start with the basics.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,210
A swap contract specifies an exchange

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,820
of payments between two counterparties

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,330
on one or more future dates where the payment size depends

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,510
on the difference between two reference prices or interest

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,210
rates.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,000
Like futures contracts, swaps are

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,860
one kind of forward contract.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,840
In fact, a single payment swap is

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,800
equivalent to a cash settled forward contract.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,620
A multiple payment swap is like a package

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,560
of individual forward contracts, each maturing

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,450
on a different date.

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,280
A swap can be used either to hedge

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,140
or to speculate on the stream of risky cash flows.

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,590
And as for other derivatives, whether it's

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,630
considered hedging or speculating

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,780
depends on the rest of an investor's portfolio

19
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,890
and whether the swap transaction serves to decrease or increase

20
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,580
the net risk.

21
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,480


22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,700
Interest rate swaps make up the largest part

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,380
of the swap market.

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,650
The contracts are primarily used by financial institutions

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,830
seeking to manage their exposure to interest rate risk.

26
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,720
That includes commercial investment

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,080
in mortgage banks, hedge funds, and fixed income portfolio

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,380
managers.

29
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,590
In what's called a plain vanilla interest rate swap,

30
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,870
there's a periodic exchange of cash

31
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,120
over the life of the contract based

32
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,030
on the difference between the realization of a floating

33
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,600
reference rate and a preset fixed rate,

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,290
and based on a notional principal or contract size,

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,090
say, a million dollars.

36
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,870
So for example, a contract might specify

37
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,400
that a fixed rate of 10% will be exchanged annually

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,240
for a floating payment based on one-year LIBOR

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,910
over a period of five years.

40
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,720
LIBOR stands for the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate.

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,670
It's a rate at which banks report

42
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,700
they're willing to lend to other high quality banks for a given

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,670
maturity.

44
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,740
Because of the serious problems that

45
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,460
arose with LIBOR reporting during the financial crisis,

46
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,200
regulators have mandated that LIBOR be phased out by 2022

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,120
and replaced with more reliable benchmarks.

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,730
A leading replacement in the US is

49
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,160
SOFR, which stands for the Secured Overnight Funding Rate.

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,000
As with LIBOR, its purpose in the context of the swap market

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,890
is to provide a short term reference

52
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,710
rate over the life of the swap contract.

53
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,610
Another useful and related piece of terminology

54
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,620
is that an interest rate swap can

55
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,520
be described as a package of contracts known as forward rate

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,890
agreements or FRAs.

57
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,060
In a forward rate agreement, a pre-specified fixed interest

58
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,550
rate payment is exchanged for a payment that

59
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,710
depends on a floating rate.

60
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,870
The absence of arbitrage opportunities

61
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,070
means that swaps, forward rate agreements, futures contracts,

62
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,220
and interest rates, and the cash bond market, all

63
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,440
must be priced consistently.

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,660
We've already been using the basic terminology

65
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,670
for plain vanilla interest rate swaps,

66
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,510
but it's useful to summarize.

67
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,640
The notional principle is the basis

68
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,070
for calculating the fixed and floating interest rate.

69
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,840
It's called notional because there's no actual exchange

70
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,420
of principle amounts.

71
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,030
There are two counterparties to the swap, one on each side.

72
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,570
The fixed rate payer pays the fixed rate

73
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,150
that's pre-specified in the contract,

74
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,640
and receives the floating rate.

75
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,400
As a matter of convention, the fixed rate payer

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,330
is said to have bought the swap or as long the swap.

77
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,340
You can think of the swap as being

78
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,360
a long position in the underlying interest rates.

79
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,680
It becomes more valuable as market interest rates go up.

80
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,100
The floating rate payer pays the floating rate

81
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,090
and receives the fixed rate, and is said to be short the swap.

82
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,480
Again, this can be understood as a short position in the market

83
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,500
interest rate so that there's a gain when rates go down.

84
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,000
