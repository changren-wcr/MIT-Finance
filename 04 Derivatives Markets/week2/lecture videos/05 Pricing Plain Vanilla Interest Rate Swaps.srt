1
00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:03,320
PROFESSOR: We're now going to go through the logic of how

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,590
the fixed rate on a plain vanilla swap is determined.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,870
It also involves no-arbitrage logic,

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,060
but it's a little bit more complicated than what

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,720
we've done up to this point.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,730
The diagram here represents the cash

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,970
flows in a swap from the perspective of the floating

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,030
rate payer.

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,340
Notice that the diagram is drawn as

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,550
if principal payments are exchanged, even though they're

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,410
not.

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,640
That is, the notional principal, denoted here by a capital F,

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,450
is assumed to be exchanged along with the final interest-based

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:50,480
payment at the final date, N. The minus F and plus F

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,650
cancel out, reflecting that no principal is actually

16
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,700
exchanged.

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,830
The advantage of this representation

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,440
is that it simplifies the valuation calculation

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,990
by highlighting the swap is equivalent to holding

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,850
two positions.

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,540
The first is a long position in a fixed rate bond,

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,870
with a coupon rate c equal to the fixed rate specified

23
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,760
in the swap contract.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,490
Those generate the payments c times F, c times F, c times F,

25
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,520
c times F, all the way out to the final c

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,340
times F payment at time N.

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,770
The second position is a short position

28
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,020
in a floating rate bond.

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,200
The floating rate is indexed by a subscript representing

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,450
the time the rate is locked in, which

31
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,640
is always one period before the money is paid out.

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,550
For example, the floating rate paid

33
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,250
at the first exchange of payments,

34
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:55,880
r0 is based on the rate in the market as of time 0.

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:03,940
The rate at time 1 is determined here, but paid at time 2,

36
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,735
and so forth.

37
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:07,670


38
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,690
That generates a sequence of floating rate payments,

39
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,860
F times r0, F times r1, F times r2, all the way out to F times

40
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,060
rN minus 1.

41
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,140


42
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,990
As with other foreign contracts, the payoffs

43
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,300
on every future date are zero-sum

44
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,620
between the long and short side of a swap.

45
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,290
Since it's costless to enter into the swap

46
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,040
and both counterparties do it voluntarily,

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,350
it has to be that the swap terms are

48
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,940
set so the net present value of the promised payments are 0.

49
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,620
Let's think for a second about why that is.

50
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,760
Well, it's the usual reason with forward contracts

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,600
that if the NPV were positive for one counterparty,

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,660
it would be negative for the other one.

53
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,330
And the counterparty with the negative NPV

54
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,000
would not agree to the swap terms.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,010
This idea, together with what we will

56
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,350
see about the value of a floating rate bond,

57
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,215
will tie down the fixed rate on a swap.

58
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:17,000


59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,040
A key ingredient to be able to price swaps

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,950
is to understand the price dynamics of safe floating rate

61
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,150
bonds.

62
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,330
You already know that for fixed rate bonds, when

63
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,420
interest rates go up, the price goes down

64
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,300
because the fixed future payments are discounted

65
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,520
at a new higher rate.

66
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,710
For floating rate bonds, the price behavior

67
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,800
when interest rates change is quite different than for coupon

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,270
bonds.

69
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,820
In fact, floating rate bonds always

70
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,830
price at par, or face value, on reset dates.

71
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,460
Intuitively, the reason that the price of floating rate bonds

72
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,140
is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes is this.

73
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,610
With a variable rate, if interest rates go up,

74
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,830
so do future interest payments.

75
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,020
Hence, the interest payment does the work

76
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,600
of bringing the yield up to the current market level

77
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,670
without the need for the price to adjust.

78
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,270


79
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,430
The rest of the algebra you see on this slide

80
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,120
is a proof that the price is equal to par on reset dates.

81
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,130
You can take a look if you're interested,

82
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,860
but you're only responsible for knowing the fact

83
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,360
that the price is par on the reset dates.

84
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,600
Between reset dates, the price of a floating rate bond

85
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,360
does move inversely to interest rates.

86
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,780
But because only the next payment is locked in,

87
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,770
and it will be made soon, the price effects tend to be small.

88
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,730


89
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,230
Another fact that you might want to know about floating rate

90
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,900
bonds is that they are very similar from the perspective

91
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,060
of the borrower to a strategy of rolling over a short-term debt.

92
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,520
A possible advantage of floating rate bonds

93
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,480
is that they avoid the issuance costs of repeatedly issuing

94
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,850
short-term debt.

95
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,370
However, because the bonds may be

96
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,590
less liquid than short-term debt,

97
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,930
the rates charged may be somewhat higher.

98
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,120


99
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,190
Now that we know how floating rate bonds are priced,

100
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,450
we can return to the question of how swap rates are determined

101
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,290
on a new swap contract.

102
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,010
As I mentioned earlier, because the swap is a zero-sum contract

103
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,890
and must be fair to both counterparties,

104
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,040
it has to be the case that the present value of the fixed rate

105
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,710
payments equal the present value of the floating rate payments.

106
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,810
We know that the floating rate payments

107
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,530
when represented as a floating rate bond will price at par.

108
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,560
That means that the fixed rate payments,

109
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,660
when represented as a coupon bond, must also price at par.

110
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,420
Together, that implies that the fixed rate on the swap

111
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,580
is determined by setting the present value

112
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,580
of the future fixed rate payments equal to par.

113
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,280


114
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,240
But looking back at our earlier representation, what we're

115
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,680
saying here is that the price or the present value

116
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,970
of the fixed rate payments has to be

117
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:27,010
equal to F, the face or par value,

118
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:32,020
and we're going to need to solve for the coupon rate that makes

119
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,830
that the case.

120
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,430


121
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,070
The final important step to understand swap pricing

122
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,360
is to tie the swap rate back to the spot yield curve.

123
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,420
Remember that the spot yield curve provides a discount rate

124
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,660
for cash flows arriving at different future times.

125
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,390


126
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,880
We can then write down an expression

127
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,540
that equates to par value of the notional fixed rate bond

128
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,290
to the present value of the promised fixed rate payments,

129
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,560
where the coupon rate c now is a free variable.

130
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,850


131
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:16,490
Since the notional principal F cancels

132
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,820
from both sides of this equation,

133
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,840
and if we can observe the appropriate yield curve,

134
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,470
then we can solve for the fixed rate c that makes this

135
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,370
a quality hold.

136
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,540


137
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,630
In practice, the appropriate rates

138
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,330
for discounting swap payments may

139
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,170
be somewhat different than a treasury yield curve, which

140
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,330
reflects that the two markets are

141
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,140
identical in terms of liquidity or risk

142
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,130
or taxes or other factors.

143
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,520
To adjust for this market participants

144
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,680
use a swap spot yield curve for swap pricing.

145
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,620
The swap yield curve is determined from market swap

146
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,260
prices, just as the treasury yield

147
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,970
curve is determined by the market

148
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,120
price of Treasury securities.

149
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,400
Two final observations-- first we've

150
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,670
seen that, to eliminate arbitrage opportunities,

151
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,740
swaps are priced to be consistent

152
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,380
with the appropriate yield curve, which

153
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,200
means the pricing is also consistent with the implied

154
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,050
forward rates in that yield curve with forward rate

155
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,720
agreements and with other interest rate forward

156
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,419
and futures contracts.

157
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,120
Second, the value of a swap changes over time

158
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,880
as market conditions evolve.

159
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,590
After a swap is initiated and if interest rates have changed,

160
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,080
the present value of the fixed rate payments

161
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,100
will no longer equal the value of the floating rate payments.

162
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,880
For instance, if rates fall, the floating rate payer

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,270
will benefit because the fixed rate payments received

164
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,360
won't be affected, but the floating rate payments

165
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,410
made will be lower.

166
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,372
