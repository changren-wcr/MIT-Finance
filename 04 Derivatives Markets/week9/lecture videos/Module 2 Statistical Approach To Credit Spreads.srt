1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,390
PROFESSOR: The credit spread, also sometimes called

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,000
a yield spread, is the difference

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,640
in the yield-to-maturity on a risky bond

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,370
and on a Treasury bond of similar maturity.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,100
The statistical approach to pricing credit risk

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,890
seeks to explain a portion of the credit spread

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,820
based on estimates of default and recovery rates.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,600
Data on credit spreads by rating is readily available,

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,850
for instance, on the website, FRED,

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,790
which provides economic time series data from the Federal

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,190
Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,640
Such time series data are often presented

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,800
as an option-adjusted spread.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,490
As I mentioned last week, that means that the reported yields

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,350
have been adjusted to remove the effects

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,700
of other embedded options, such as prepayment or call options.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,750
For a given credit rating, the observed yield spread also

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,840
tends to vary with maturity.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,660
Credit spreads tend to increase with maturity,

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,330
as one might expect, due to the greater

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,520
risk of an adverse event occurring over longer horizons.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,280
However, that pattern sometimes reverses

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,040
at very long maturities, with credit spreads

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,800
starting to narrow.

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,400
That may partially reflect compositional differences

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,010
in firms borrowing at different maturities,

27
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,920
with only high quality borrowers able to issue

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,375
very long maturity debt.

29
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:32,600


30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,110
These figures show the average credit spread on BB bonds

31
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,070
on the top panel and on AA bonds in the bottom panel

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,130
between 1997 and 2020.

33
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,610
The shaded areas are recessions.

34
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,340
The BB bonds are below investment grade

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,010
and have significantly higher spreads

36
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,430
than do the much safer AA bonds.

37
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,370
Not surprisingly, the spreads mirror the pattern

38
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,710
we saw for default rates, which spike

39
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,290
during economic downturns.

40
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,750
The increase in yields during recessions

41
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,479
translates into a decrease in prices,

42
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,080
again, consistent with the idea that risky debt has

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,980
a positive beta that implies that their prices will

44
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,140
be lower because of the market risk premium.

45
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,720


46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,210
The difference in the yield to maturity between treasuries

47
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,550
and default of securities of the same maturity

48
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,090
can conceptually be decomposed into several components.

49
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,330
The first is based on the statistics we've just

50
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,150
been discussing, the default rate and the loss given

51
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,480
default. The product of the two gives

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,700
an annualized expected loss rate.

53
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,340


54
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,710
In addition, there's compensation

55
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,190
for the market or beta risk associated with these losses.

56
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,100
In the representation here, that's

57
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,500
incorporated using risk-neutral probabilities

58
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,890
and risk-neutral expectations in the calculation of the expected

59
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,150
loss rate.

60
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,460
The risk-neutral expected loss rate

61
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,040
is higher than the physical expected loss rate

62
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,480
because it includes the value of the associated market risk.

63
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,550
Empirical analyses of credit spreads

64
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,530
find that plausible estimates of risk-adjusted expected losses

65
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,170
account for only a fraction of the observed credit spread.

66
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,420
The remaining non-credit component

67
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,750
is attributable to other factors like differences and tax

68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,890
treatment and the presence of other embedded options.

69
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,730
The residual, after accounting for all identifiable effects,

70
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,830
is usually described as a liquidity premium.

71
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,950
The liquidity premium is viewed as compensation

72
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,550
to investors for the relative illiquidity of corporate bonds

73
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,310
relative to treasuries.

74
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,590
Finally, something to remember in modeling credit

75
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,130
spreads and their implications for default and recovery rates

76
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,890
is that because the non-credit component of the rate spread

77
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,190
is often sizable, neglecting that fact

78
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,880
may result in overestimating the probability of default

79
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,855
and the loss rate.

80
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:08,160


81
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,830
A fairly simple valuation model for risky debt

82
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,590
that's consistent with the statistical approach to credit

83
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,680
risk modeling is developed in the next few slides.

84
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,450
The model takes, as inputs, a bond's fixed characteristics

85
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,050
that include its coupon rate and time to maturity

86
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,390
and assumes a face value of a dollar.

87
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,090
It also takes as inputs estimates of the default

88
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,480
rate, the recovery rate and the risk-adjusted expected return

89
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,140
on the bond.

90
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,260
The model outputs are the bond's predicted yield to maturity

91
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,340
per period and its price.

92
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,380
The model is implemented in the spreadsheet default.xls that's

93
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,570
available to you on the class page.

94
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,500
Note that the model abstracts from non-credit features

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,690
of the yield spread and so may not

96
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,470
produce price predictions that match observed market prices.

97
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,890
Matching market prices might require an adjustment

98
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,750
based on an estimate of the liquidity

99
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,480
premium and other factors.

100
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,710
In this model, T denotes the number of remaining periods

101
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,700
in a bond's life.

102
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,450
If coupons are paid annually, then T will represent years.

103
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,970
If coupons are semi-annual, T will be years times 2.

104
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,390
And the coupon rate, c, will be the annual coupon

105
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,100
rate divided by 2.

106
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,360
Similarly, if coupons are paid monthly,

107
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,930
T should be the number of years of remaining life times 12.

108
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,300
And the coupon rate, c, should be

109
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,660
the annual rate divided by 12.

110
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,095
All calculations are per dollar of face value.

111
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:53,860


112
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,370
With a constant default rate, d, assumed

113
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,010
per period, the probability of the firm

114
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,560
not defaulting up until time t is

115
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,590
1 minus d to the power of t minus 1.

116
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,870
The fixed recovery rate is denoted by a small g.

117
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,570
It's the share of principal and accrued interest that's

118
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,250
assumed to be recovered at the time of a default.

119
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,020
The expected rate of return, r, is the risk-free rate

120
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,950
plus a market risk premium.

121
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,400
For example, a BBB bond might be expected

122
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,960
to have a beta of about 0.1.

123
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,940
This expected return will be used

124
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,655
in the model for discounting expected cash flows.

125
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,400


126
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,590
In the model, the bond price is found

127
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,740
by calculating the present value of expected future cash

128
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,265
flows discounting at the expected return, r.

129
00:06:57,265 --> 00:07:01,920


130
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,610
To understand the model, consider the expected payment

131
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,570
on a bond at a time i which is less than T.

132
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,670
It clearly depends on whether or not

133
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,000
a default has already occurred, because if the bond is already

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,590
in default, then the expected payment at that time is zero.

135
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,950
The probability that the firm has survived without default

136
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,810
until time i is 1 minus d to the i minus 1.

137
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,990
And in that case, it will make a payment during that period.

138
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,950
If there's no default at time i, the full coupon payment

139
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,270
will be made.

140
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,870
That happens with probability 1 minus d.

141
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,640
If there is a default, which happens with probability d,

142
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,500
a recovery will be made based on the recovery rate, g,

143
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,560
multiplied by the amount owed of 1 plus c.

144
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,000
The last term here represents the present value

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
of the return of principal at maturity

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,015
when there's no default over the entire life of the bond.

147
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:15,560


148
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,350
Now, once you've used this equation

149
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,890
to estimate the bond's price, we can figure out

150
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,800
its yield-to-maturity in the usual way

151
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,890
by equating that price to the present value of the promised

152
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,905
cash flows treating them as if they're certain.

153
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:34,150


154
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,809
If you play with the spreadsheet,

155
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:39,340
you'll see that for bonds with high default or low recovery

156
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,909
rates, the yield-to-maturity will be significantly higher

157
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,160
than the expected return.

158
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,110
That's because part of the yield spread

159
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,500
is compensation for expected losses.

160
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,000
