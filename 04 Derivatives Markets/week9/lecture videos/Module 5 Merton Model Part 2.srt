00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,790
PROFESSOR: A more physical sense of what's

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,680
going on in the Merton model is obtained

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,380
by considering what happens along a single sample

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,610
path for asset value over time.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,000
In this example here, the face value of debt

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,030
is the solid red line, and the asset value

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,440
winds up below that value at the debt maturity date.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,750
The loss given default on that path

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,330
is just the difference between the face value

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,050
and the asset value on that maturity date.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,110
You can think of the model is equivalent to running many risk

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,350
neutral Monte Carlo paths of lognormal model for asset

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,160
prices and calculating the present value of the expected

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,210
loss given default by averaging across those many paths.

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,910
With the predicted bond price from the Merton model,

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,490
it's straightforward to derive the corresponding credit

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,620
spread.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,450
We start with the bond price D0 and find the yield

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,200
to maturity on the bond on a continuous basis

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,060
from this formula here.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,880
Substituting in the expression for D0

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,070
that's based on the price of a risk free bond minus the price

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,440
of a put option, we can rearrange

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,110
and solve for the credit spread, which is given here.

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,860
As you'd expect, the spread gets wider the more valuable

26
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,890
the put option, which of course equals the value

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,195
of the expected losses.

28
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:32,030


29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,920
How the credits spread moves over time

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,230
depends on the model parameters, and it's

31
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,500
especially sensitive to asset volatility and the leverage

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,020
ratio, D divided by A.

33
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,670
These graphs show the relationship

34
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,580
for two different levels of assumed asset volatility

35
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,760
and for a range of leverage ratios.

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,760
The graphs reveal some counterfactual predictions

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,120
of the model.

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,800
One is that the credit spread is close to 0

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,110
when the bond is nearing maturity.

40
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,380
The technical reason for that is because the price of the asset

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,110
is assumed to follow a continuous path,

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,060
and there's essentially no chance

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,400
over a short horizon of a price move

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,580
that is adverse enough for the possibility of loss to become

45
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,466
significant.

46
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:19,540
A second problem is that the predicted magnitudes

47
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,000
of the credit spreads are far lower than those

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,220
observed in the data.

49
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,590
As I mentioned earlier, one reason for that

50
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,360
is that the empirical credit spread

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,890
reflects more than just the direct cost of default losses.

52
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,190
Finally, the pattern of sharply declining credit spreads

53
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,770
over time for some parameterizations

54
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,550
is also contrary to what is observed in the market.

55
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,190
The reason in the model for the declining spreads

56
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,240
is that assets on average grow and the face value of the debt

57
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,000
is fixed, which has the effect of reducing

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,910
the likelihood of default over time as the leverage

59
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,800
ratio tends to shrink.

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,760
Despite these shortcomings, it's convenient to use this model

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,250
to develop an understanding of the relative pricing

62
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,920
of some more complicated debt structures,

63
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,200
and we'll turn to that next.

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,330
We'll also discuss some modifications

65
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,300
to the basic model that address some of these shortcomings

66
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,530
and that produce more reliable price estimates.

67
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,720
Corporations often issue a combination

68
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,700
of senior and junior debt.

69
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,760
Doing that may lower the total cost of debt financing

70
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,710
by creating securities that appeal

71
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,420
to clienteles with different tolerances for risk and return.

72
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,850
In the event of default, the senior debt

73
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,860
is fully repaid before the junior debt

74
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,170
holders receive any payments.

75
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,000
Both groups of debt holders must be

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,620
repaid before any value goes to the equity holders.

77
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,960
To take a simple example, imagine

78
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,780
that a firm has two issues of zero-coupon bonds

79
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,580
outstanding, both maturing at the same time Cap(t).

80
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,430
Fs is the face value of the senior debt,

81
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,500
and Fj is the face value of the junior debt.

82
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,220
This table describes the payoffs to the different claimants

83
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,870
as a function of the asset value at maturity, V sub t.

84
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,570
If the asset value is less than the face

85
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,720
value of the senior debt, the entire value

86
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,510
goes to pay the senior debt holders.

87
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,820
If the asset value is enough to pay

88
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,240
the senior debt holders but less than the sum of the face

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,760
value of the junior and the senior debt,

90
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,610
then the junior debt holders get the remaining value

91
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,690
after the senior debt holders are paid in full.

92
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,480
Finally, if the asset value is greater

93
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,680
than the sum of the face value of the junior and senior debt,

94
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
there isn't a default. The bondholders are paid in full,

95
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,200
and any residual asset value goes to the equity holders.

96
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,940
That description of the payoffs can

97
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,980
be translated into expressions that

98
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,110
are in terms of the value of call options

99
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,220
on the underlying assets of the firm.

100
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,670
The senior debt holders have a position

101
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,630
that's equivalent to owning the assets of the firm

102
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,190
and writing a call option.

103
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,000


104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,390
That call option has a strike price

105
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,270
equal to the face value of their debt.

106
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:31,580
Then the junior debt holders are long that same call option,

107
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,800
and they're short another call option with the strike price

108
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,400
equal to the sum of the face value of the senior

109
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,500
and the junior debt.

110
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,100
Finally, as we know, the equity holders

111
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,540
are long the call option written by the junior debt

112
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,170
holders, which has a strike price of the sum of the face

113
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,610
values of the debt.

114
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,490
For pricing more complicated structured claims,

115
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,860
the stochastic model for asset prices

116
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,530
can be implemented on a risk neutral binomial tree

117
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,600
or with Monte Carlo that can then

118
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,850
be used for finding and pricing the payoffs

119
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,210
to different claimants.
