1
00:00:01,311 --> 00:00:04,059
PROFESSOR: When the default barrier is more complicated

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,220
and default can occur at any time,

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,400
binomial pricing approach is a natural choice.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,280
I'll illustrate that approach with a simplified version

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,010
of an analysis I led at the Congressional Budget Office

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,250
to determine the value of a loan guarantee made by the US

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,560
government to America West Airlines,

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,100
or AWA, shortly after 9/11.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,610
At that time, AWA was the eighth largest passenger airline

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,160
in the United States but it had already

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,590
been experiencing financial difficulties

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,930
as had the rest of the industry.

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,530
Following 9/11, Moody's downgraded AWA

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:47,250
from B1 in early April of 2001 to CA on November 21, 2001.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,160
Well, to help airlines that had experienced large revenue

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,380
drops in the wake of the terrorist attack,

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,020
Congress enacted a program to allow airlines

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,870
to apply for credit guarantees.

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,380
AWA received approval for a government loan guarantee

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,790
on $380 million of new debt it planned to issue.

21
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,980
In return, the government received fees and warrants.

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,920
My team was asked to calculate the value of the net assistance

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,770
provided to AWA and I want to show you that analysis.

24
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,150
The valuation exercise was based on estimates of the key inputs

25
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,140
that are listed here.

26
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,720
The risk-free rate, loan maturity, loan coupon rate,

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,110
and rest of the firm capital structure were observable.

28
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,470
Since AWA was publicly traded, data

29
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,220
was available on historical returns that

30
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,960
could be used to estimate its equity beta and equity

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,070
volatility.

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,840
The default barrier was set to be

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,170
similar to the one I just described for the KMV model

34
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,250
based on its liabilities.

35
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,490
The guaranteed debt was pre-payable and because

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,310
of the high guarantee fees charged by the government,

37
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,470
it seemed likely that it would be prepaid

38
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,350
if AWA's assets recovered to the point

39
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,030
where it could more inexpensively

40
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,200
borrow on its own.

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,210
Rules for pre-payment based on an assumed prepayment barrier

42
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,540
were therefore also incorporated.

43
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,110
As in all Morton style models, a first critical step

44
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,620
is to estimate the initial value of firm assets and asset

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,150
volatility.

46
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,270
That first stage was based on using a simple Merton

47
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,480
model with a single debt maturity date.

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,060
Sensitivity analysis showed that the results

49
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,690
were fairly stable over a range of plausible assumptions

50
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,240
for the default barrier.

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,420
The next step was to represent the returns on assets

52
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,150
as a normally distributed stochastic process

53
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,900
with a constant drift.

54
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,080
That model can be represented in either a physical or

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,570
risk-neutral form, the only difference

56
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,250
being the drift term.

57
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,310
In the physical representation, the drift

58
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,320
is the expected risk-adjusted return

59
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,770
on assets minus any payouts.

60
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,410
That representation is useful for analyzing

61
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,950
the true distribution of possible outcomes.

62
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,470
In the risk-neutral representation,

63
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,890
the drift is based on the risk-free rate, also

64
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,770
minus an assumed payout rate.

65
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,530
That representation is used for pricing derivatives

66
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,730
on the asset process, including the loan guarantee,

67
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,770
the warrants received by the government, and the fees paid.

68
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,960
To represent that continuous time process

69
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,930
on a discrete binomial tree with time step,

70
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,770
delta T, the asset process on the up and down nodes

71
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,440
is given by these equations.

72
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,490
Here they're shown for the risk-neutral case.

73
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,360
The drift affects both subsequent nodes the same way

74
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,780
and the addition or subtraction of the volatility term

75
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,810
causes the vertical distance between the two nodes

76
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,370
at the same time to be spaced by 2 standard deviations.

77
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,470
To price the guarantee, the next step

78
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,510
is to identify the nodes where a default will

79
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,930
occur based on comparing the asset value to the default

80
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,040
barrier.

81
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,839
Say a default cause is here and here.

82
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,240
To keep the numerical example simple,

83
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,230
I'm abstracting from the more complicated situation for AWA

84
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,250
and assuming its only liability is a guaranteed zero coupon

85
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,800
bond that has a face value of F.

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,500
The guaranteed payout on nodes who are a default occurs

87
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,260
is calculated, weighted by the probability

88
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,520
of reaching that node, and discounted back to time 0.

89
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,980
To attach numbers to the example,

90
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,310
imagine that the guarantee is on a three-year zero coupon

91
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,060
bond with a face value of $900, that the risk-free interest

92
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,500
rate is 5%, and that the risk neutral probability of an up

93
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,670
is 0.5.

94
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,120
The initial asset value is estimated to be $1,000,

95
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,760
and the calibrated tree with the inferred asset

96
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,820
volatility and other assumptions looks like the one pictured

97
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,620
here.

98
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,920
Default occurs at time 3 on the lowest two nodes

99
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,040
because the asset value is less than the $900 face

100
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,880
value of the bond.

101
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,040


102
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,100
This tree shows the payout by the government

103
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,640
on the guarantee on each node where a default occurs.

104
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,270
Discounting back to time 0 implies a guarantee value

105
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,030
of 30.126.

106
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,830
The risky bond value can be found

107
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,490
by calculating its value as if it had no default risk

108
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,940
and subtracting the value of the guarantee.

109
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,230
The calibrated binomial model of AWA's asset value

110
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,760
was used to estimate not only the value of the government

111
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,810
guarantee but also the value of the warrants and guarantee fees

112
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,470
that the firm gave the government in exchange.

113
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,470
This table summarizes the terms of the deal.

114
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,490
Notice that at 8% annually, the guarantee fee

115
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,850
was quite high, although still substantially less

116
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,910
than the credit spread AWA would have faced directly

117
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,100
in the market without a guarantee.

118
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,750
With the guarantee, AWA was able to borrow at a much lower rate

119
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,800
of LIBOR plus 40 basis points.

120
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,320
You may be wondering why, with the guarantee,

121
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,190
the borrowing rate is still higher than the risk-free rate.

122
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,400
That can be attributed to the low liquidity of the debt

123
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,680
and also that investors may believe

124
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,440
that an unforeseen event could cause the guarantee

125
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,950
to be revoked.

126
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,750
The warrants gave the government the right

127
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,360
to purchase 18.8 million shares of stock for $3 per share

128
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,670
after 10 years.

129
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,400
The results of the AWA analysis are summarized here.

130
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,620
The guarantee was estimated to be worth $150.5 million,

131
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,820
more than the sum of the value of the warrants and fees.

132
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,310
Unmet, the present value of the subsidy

133
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,930
was estimated to be $43.7 million.

134
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,080
Note that whereas the loan guarantee had payouts

135
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,090
on the lower branches of the tree,

136
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,130
the valuation of the warrants was

137
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:25,440
based on their payouts occurring on the upper branches.

138
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,380
The fees were also valued on the tree.

139
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,960
Fee payments were positive on most of the nodes

140
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,540
but zero on some of them.

141
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,790
The possibility of zero fees arose

142
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,450
because the loan was assumed to be prepaid on nodes with a very

143
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,570
high asset value and also because no fees

144
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,380
were paid on nodes where the firm was in default.

145
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,710
A final comment is that this estimate represents the market

146
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,960
value of the net subsidy.

147
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,750
In its official cost estimates, the US government

148
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,540
treats its cost of capital as the risk-free rate,

149
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,300
effectively ignoring the cost of the market risk

150
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,460
it passes through to taxpayers when

151
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,710
it provides credit support.

152
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,140
Under that assumption, the net profit

153
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,380
is estimated to be positive because the warrants are

154
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,260
assessed to be worth more, and the guarantees

155
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,750
are assessed to be worth less than

156
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,500
in this market-based analysis.

157
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,000
