00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:02,700
PROFESSOR: This week, we'll cover several approaches

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,320
for quantifying and pricing credit risk.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,790
Credit risk is one of my main research and policy interests,

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,810
and I'm looking forward to telling you about it.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,320
We'll start with a statistical approach, where the main focus

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,620
is on estimating default and recovery rates for securities

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,000
with credit risk.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,260
Those statistics help to explain the credit spread, which

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,150
is the difference in promised yields

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,910
between safe and credit-sensitive securities

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,920
that are otherwise similar.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,340
We'll then turn to the structural approach that

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,070
relates both to default and recovery rate

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,340
to a stochastic model of an entity's asset value

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,160
and a rule for when a default is triggered.

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,580
Those models treat default as a put option

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,920
and apply options pricing methods

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,560
to value default losses.

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,290
As we've seen in many other contexts,

20
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,000
a derivative pricing approach can

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,790
be implemented very generally using binomial trees.

22
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,040
And if certain assumptions hold, analytical solutions,

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,600
most famously the Merton model, can be derived to price default

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,780
options.

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,190
Finally, we'll discuss credit derivatives like credit default

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,480
swaps, whose payoffs depend on the outcome of credit events

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,940
and that also can be priced by no-arbitrage principles.
