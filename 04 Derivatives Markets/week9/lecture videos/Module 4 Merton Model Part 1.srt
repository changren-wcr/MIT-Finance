1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,440
PROFESSOR: The Merton model provides

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,960
an analytical approximation formula for valuing risky debt.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,930
It's in the spirit of the Black-Scholes-Merton model

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,230
but it's different in a number of respects.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,860
Most fundamentally, it starts with the assumption

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,540
that it's the underlying firm asset

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,150
value that's log-normally distributed,

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,640
not its stock price.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,090
The formula here represents the resulting distribution

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:36,700
of a firm's asset value, V sub T, at time T.

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,790
The value depends on a drift term that's

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,870
parameterized by a constant return parameter, mu,

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,920
and a volatility correction of minus one half sigma squared.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,660


15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,000
The volatility term is based on the parameter, sigma,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,430
multiplied by the square root of the horizon, T, and by a draw

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,560
from a standard normal density function, epsilon.

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,630
Assets are financed with a combination of debt and equity.

19
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,600
The zero coupon debt is issued at time zero,

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,960
and comes due at time T. As we saw in the payoff diagrams,

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,520
the debt will be paid in full if the asset value V of T

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,150
covers its face value and the equity holders own

23
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,000
the remaining asset value.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,790
If V sub T is less than F, the debt holders

25
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,330
become the owners of the firm, and the original equity holders

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,170
get nothing.

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,480
Although we're ultimately interested in valuing

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,540
the risky debt of the firm, the first step

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,660
is to value of the firm's equity, whose payoff is

30
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,860
the max of V of T minus F and zero,

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,100
which is a call option on the firm's assets.

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,440
Under the assumptions made, then, equity

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,080
can be valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton model

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,870
with the face value of debt as the strike price

35
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,919
and with the firm's assets as the underlying variable.

36
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,530
The familiar formula for the value of a call option

37
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,550
is shown here.

38
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,820
We know that the volatility of a firm's equity

39
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,970
can be estimated based on historical stock price data

40
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,430
or from implied volatilities of options

41
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,570
that are traded on the firm.

42
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,080
However, it's not easy to directly infer

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,420
the volatility of a firm's assets

44
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,630
because assets generally aren't traded.

45
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,570
Or to put it differently, we could estimate asset volatility

46
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,990
if we had historical data on both the market

47
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,070
value of a firm's equity and the market value of its debt,

48
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,260
but it's often difficult to find data

49
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,240
on the market price of a firm's debt

50
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,880
because either it trades infrequently

51
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,880
or it's privately placed and that information

52
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,710
isn't made public.

53
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,720
Professor Merton came up with a clever way

54
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,970
to get around that problem, which

55
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,110
is to use the formula for vega, the sensitivity of option

56
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,020
prices to changes in the volatility of the underlying

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,000
asset.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,850
The formula for vega that comes out of the Black-Scholes-Merton

59
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,350
model implies that the volatility of equity returns --

60
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,900
here, sigma E --

61
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,970
is related to the volatility of asset returns, sigma,

62
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,855
by this equation.

63
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:27,060


64
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,180
Written in this form, vega highlights

65
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,190
that the volatility of equity can

66
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,890
be much larger than that of the assets

67
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,250
through a leverage effect, which concentrates the asset

68
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,990
volatility on the equity.

69
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,090
This equation can be simplified also

70
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,450
by noticing that the denominator is

71
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,850
the Black-Scholes-Merton value of a call option on assets,

72
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,240
which we determined is the value of the equity.

73
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,950


74
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,430
Notice that the leverage effect on volatility

75
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,340
gets larger as the firm becomes more distressed

76
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,090
and the value of equity falls.

77
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,100
A very important implication of this

78
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,700
is that, for firms that are close to insolvency,

79
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,580
analyzing the expected return on equity

80
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,820
using a linear model like a CAPM becomes

81
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,470
very problematic because when volatility changes, so will

82
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,780
the stock's beta.

83
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,210
These graphs demonstrate the effect of leverage

84
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,480
on the volatility of equity in the Merton model.

85
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,090
The top graph shows the relation as a function

86
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,700
of the value of assets, and the lower graph

87
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,590
shows that as a function of the value of equity.

88
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,990
In the bottom graph, the volatility

89
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,440
changes very dramatically when equity values are low,

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,350
underscoring the potential for significant time

91
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,950
variation in volatility in a distressed firm.

92
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,010
On both graphs, the volatility of assets

93
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,500
is plotted as a flat dashed line.

94
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,820
That's because, under the assumptions of the model,

95
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,640
asset volatility is constant over time,

96
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,110
and therefore independent of the value of assets or of equity.

97
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,210
We now have what we need to infer the market

98
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,240
value of assets and the volatility of assets,

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,250
assuming we can observe or estimate

100
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,100
the market value of equity and its volatility.

101
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,270
That is to say we have two nonlinear equations and two

102
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,790
unknowns, which are the initial market value of assets

103
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,980
and the volatility of assets.

104
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,050
The first equation is the formula

105
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,480
for equity as a call option, and the second equation

106
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,130
relates to volatility of equity to the volatility of assets.

107
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,920
These equations can be solved simultaneously

108
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,610
using numerical methods, for instance using Solver in Excel.

109
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,320


110
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,180
Now we have all the information needed

111
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,120
to achieve our main goal, which is to estimate the market

112
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,940
value of a firm's risky debt.

113
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,850
The value of the risky debt is the difference

114
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:08,880
between the value of assets, which we just imputed,

115
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,440
and the value of equity, which was established

116
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,170
to be the value of a call option on the firm's assets

117
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,180
with a strike price equal to the face value of the debt.

118
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,120
Using put-call parity, the value of the debt

119
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,060
can also be described as the difference between the value

120
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,590
of the debt if it were risk-free and the value of a put option

121
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,400
on the assets with a strike price of F and an expiration

122
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,270
date the same as the maturity date on the debt.

123
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,750
That's exactly what we saw before on the payoff diagram,

124
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,520
that risky debt is equivalent to a long position in safe debt

125
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,820
and a short position in a put option.

126
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,160
Remember, too, that the value of the put option

127
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,587
equals the value of a full guarantee on the debt.

128
00:06:56,587 --> 00:06:57,087
