PROFESSOR: We'll now turn to structural modeling

1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,150
of credit risk, which differs from statistical approaches

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,330
by linking default and recovery rates to an underlying

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,900
model of the stochastic evolution of a firm's asset

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,970
value.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,390
You probably remember from your introductory finance courses

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,260
that the payoffs on the debt and equity of a corporation as

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,490
of the maturity date of the debt, time T,

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,120
can be represented as functions of the firm's total asset

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:38,010
value, V sub T. Specifically, zero coupon risky debt

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,450
receives its promised face value of F as long

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,780
as the firm's asset value is sufficiently high

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,300
to cover the promised payment.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,720
If the asset value is at less than F,

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,110
the debt holders get whatever the asset value turns out

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,160
to be.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,060
That is, they become the equity holders of the corporation.

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,820
The equity, then, is like a call option

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,950
with a strike price of F on the value of the assets at time T

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,450
since once the debt is paid off the equity holders

20
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,830
have a claim equal to the remaining value of the assets.

21
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,730
The sum of the debt and equity is, of course, the total asset

22
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,450
value and it would be represented on a payoff diagram

23
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,810
simply as a 90-degree line running through

24
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,910
the (0,0) point.

25
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:35,320


26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,270
The payoff diagram for the risky debt

27
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,450
can be further decomposed into the sum of two components.

28
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,840
The first is a risk-free bond with a face value of F.

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,945
The second is a short put option.

30
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:52,460


31
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,650
Clearly, from the diagram on the left,

32
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,610
the sum of the two positions is identical to that

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,435
of risky debt.

34
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:02,400


35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,100
The decomposition is useful when the default risk

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,220
is borne by someone other than the bondholder.

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,979
For example: when a risky loan is guaranteed

38
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,180
by a private insurance contract or by a government guarantee,

39
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,580
the value of the guarantee is just

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,870
the value of the put option.

41
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,970
With the guarantee, the bondholder

42
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,930
has a safe claim that can be valued separately,

43
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,550
discounting the payoff at the risk-free rate.

44
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,450
This example is a reminder that, because credit guarantees are

45
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,940
like put options on a company's assets,

46
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,100
they can be valued on binomial trees,

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,650
either using a replicating portfolio approach

48
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,500
or risk neutral pricing, which, as always,

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,020
are equivalent mathematically.

50
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,590
Here we have a company, XYZ, whose assets

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,370
are currently worth $100 and next period

52
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,300
will be worth $140 or $70.

53
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,980
Imagine it has debt with face value of $90,

54
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,610
and that debt is guaranteed by a third party.

55
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,890
We want to know what the value of that guarantee

56
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,340
is from the perspective of the guarantor.

57
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,980
Since we haven't looked at a replicating portfolio

58
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,860
approach for a few weeks, I'll review it here

59
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,720
by answering the question that way.

60
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,970
Well, the payout by the guarantor

61
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,310
will be 0 if the assets are worth $140 and the payout

62
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,570
will be $20 if the assets are only worth $70.

63
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,670
To use the replicating portfolio approach,

64
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,400
we also need information on the risk-free rate.

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Here, that information is represented by one-step tree

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,050
showing that a risk-free bond with a certain payoff of $100

67
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,260
currently sells for $95.

68
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,140
We replicate the payoff of the guarantee

69
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,200
by buying a fraction X of the risk-free bond

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,900
and a fraction Y of the risky firm assets.

71
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,940


72
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:08,370
Solving for X and Y, we find that X is equal to -0.4,

73
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,440
and Y is equal to 0.2857.

74
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,560
The guarantor has the equivalent of a highly leveraged

75
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,430
long position in the assets of the firm.

76
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,760
The cost of the guarantee to the issuer

77
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,720
is the cost of that replicating portfolio, which

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,580
we can calculate based on the bond

79
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:34,270
price and the current asset price to be $9.43.

80
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,180
From the perspective of the guaranteed bond holders,

81
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,220
the value of the guarantee is a positive $9.43.

82
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,000
