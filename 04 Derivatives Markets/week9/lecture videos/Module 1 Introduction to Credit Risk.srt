1
00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:03,560
PROFESSOR: There are many types of contracts

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,190
that involve credit risk, including loans to individuals

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,820
and small businesses, mortgages, sovereign debt,

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,040
and corporate debt.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,680
Although the general principles that we'll be discussing

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,740
applied to all of these, the main emphasis

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,900
will be on models that are most directly

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,910
applicable to corporate debt.

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,550
So I want to start with a few general observations

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,150
about corporate debt and the nature of default risk.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,490
The first has to do with credit ratings.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,920
As you probably know, rating agencies

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,080
like Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,380
assign ratings to corporate debt issues that give investors

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,390
some idea of the default risk that's

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,730
associated with a particular issuer or security.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,260
There are many levels of ratings,

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,820
ranging from very safe triple-A rated securities down to D

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,750
rated securities that are in default.

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,910
A major distinction based on ratings

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,880
is the difference between investment grade

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,769
and below investment grade.

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,720
Below investment grade securities

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,960
are also described as speculative, high-yield,

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,770
or junk.

26
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,200
High-yield bonds historically have

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,990
had much higher default rates than investment grade bonds.

28
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,010
However, many high-yield bonds were originally

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,000
investment grade and they were downgraded as their issuers ran

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,360
into trouble.

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,920
These are the so-called fallen angels.

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,260
Hence buying an investment grade bond

33
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,870
isn't a guarantee that you won't eventually

34
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,150
experience default losses.

35
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,450
However, it's interesting that high-yield bonds have performed

36
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,980
well historically in the sense of having realized relatively

37
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,130
high risk adjusted returns.

38
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,690
Regarding the nature of default risk,

39
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,570
it's also important to understand

40
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,270
that only a small percentage of corporate bonds

41
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,010
will ever default. Nevertheless, bond prices are significantly

42
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,730
affected by the possibility that default losses will occur

43
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,430
and the fact that the likelihood of loss

44
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,690
vary significantly over time.

45
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,230
While default events are rare, rating changes

46
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,060
are much more frequent.

47
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,850
Those are a manifestation of default risk

48
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,000
and can be described as downgrade risk.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,060
A bond that's downgraded when the market isn't expecting it

50
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,600
is likely to experience a price drop and conversely

51
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,510
for a bond that's upgraded.

52
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,690
There are variants of events that themselves don't directly

53
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,600
cause default but that can significantly

54
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,340
change its likelihood.

55
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,890
For instance, a legal ruling that significantly

56
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,400
changes the profitability of a corporation.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,510
Liquidity, that is the ability to buy or sell a bond quickly

58
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,290
with minimal price impact, is typically lower

59
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,160
for riskier bonds, hence credit risk and liquidity

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,140
risk tend to be related.

61
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,480
Default and recovery rates are key statistics

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,670
used to quantify credit risk.

63
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,860
The default rate is the probability

64
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,870
that a default will occur.

65
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,710
It's usually stated on an annual basis.

66
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,370
What constitutes a default event depends on whose definition

67
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,660
is being used.

68
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,480
Rating agencies have stated criteria

69
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,400
for what determines a default and then

70
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,650
contracts like credit default swaps

71
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,870
also will specify what they treat as a default event.

72
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,380
Now, the recovery rate is the percentage of the amount owed,

73
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,500
usually principal plus any accrued interest,

74
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,600
that will be received by the creditor

75
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,230
in the event of a default. Recoveries

76
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,730
are calculated in various ways.

77
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,280
One approach is to estimate the present value of the cash that

78
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,040
will be eventually recovered, such as when

79
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,560
the remaining assets of the firm are liquidated.

80
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,980
Alternatively, sometimes the market price

81
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,040
of the bond right after default is announced

82
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,840
is used as a proxy for the present value of recoveries.

83
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,630
Note that the recovery rate is one minus the loss rate.

84
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:21,285
And the loss rate is also called the loss given default.

85
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:23,990
Default and recovery rates can vary significantly

86
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,850
over the life of a bond.

87
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,450
For example, a bond issued to build a nuclear power plant

88
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,910
may have a much higher probability of default

89
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,780
and a lower expected recovery rate during the first few years

90
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,830
it's outstanding and the plant is still under construction.

91
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,280
Once the reactor is up and running and producing revenues,

92
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,210
it's much less likely that there will be a default.

93
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,850
That sort of situation can also give rise

94
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,950
to what's called a term structure of default

95
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,510
and recovery rates.

96
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,520
In the model we're going to look at,

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,250
for simplicity, we'll assume that those rates are

98
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,800
held constant, but the model is easily

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,590
modified to incorporate a term structure of rates.

100
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,460


101
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,150
This graph illustrates the magnitude of default rates

102
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,180
over time for investment grade, speculative grade,

103
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,110
and overall debt issuances for the period from 1981 to 2018.

104
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,000
I want to highlight several observations here.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,230
First, there are clearly large fluctuations

106
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,310
in default rates over time with spikes during recessions.

107
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,450
Those fluctuations are driven by speculative grade debt.

108
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,630
As shown here, those spikes and default rates

109
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:42,470
occurred during the 1991, 2001, and 2008 recessions.

110
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,230
Second, even in recessions, default rates

111
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,380
are close to zero for investment grade debt.

112
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,590
The overall default rate is also quite low.

113
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,680
Over this time period, it only touched 4%

114
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,900
in the severe recession of 2008-2009 and for most periods

115
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,760
it's below 2%.

116
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,940
Importantly, the positive covariance

117
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,060
of default rates with the economic downturns imparts

118
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,960
market risk to corporate debt, hence risky corporate debt

119
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,980
has a positive beta and the cost of that market risk

120
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,850
is reflected in bond prices.

121
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,000
