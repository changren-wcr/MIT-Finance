1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,040
PROFESSOR: The Merton model captures

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,750
some of the most important drivers of credit risk,

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,020
including the volatility of the value of assets

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,020
backing an obligation and how leveraged those assets are.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,980
An advantage over a simple statistical approach

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,670
is that it links the probability and severity of default events,

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,650
and provides a framework to understand

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,080
how the cost of credit risk will evolve over time

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,060
with market conditions.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,090
Nevertheless, Merton's analytical formulas

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,370
rest on strong assumptions that are clearly

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,500
violated in practice.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,990
In response, researchers have developed

14
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,050
related models that avoid some of those shortcomings.

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,730
Those models are typically solved

16
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,220
numerically and implemented with binomial trees

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,320
or using Monte Carlo simulation.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,570
Several of the variations deal with the issue

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,300
that firms have complicated capital structures

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,580
with a variety of maturities of debt

21
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,340
and that when debt matures, it's typically

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,310
rolled over into new debt.

23
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,920
That includes early bankruptcy and stationary leverage.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,709
With early bankruptcy, there is the possibility

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,770
of default at any time and default is typically

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,720
assumed to be triggered by assets falling

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,630
below some default boundary.

28
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,360
Default is still a put option, but now it's

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,080
treated as an American option.

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,210
The assumption of stationary leverage

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,700
is a way of setting a default boundary, which

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,550
can be defined in various ways.

33
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,800
Assuming stationary leverage incorporates

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,850
the idea that debt tends to be rolled over rather than retired

35
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,160
and, that as asset values change,

36
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,160
leverage may be gradually adjusted towards some target

37
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,370
leverage ratio.

38
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,650
Modeling firm values as unobservable

39
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,190
incorporates the possibility of surprise bankruptcies

40
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,580
due to event risk, such as when embezzlement or fraud

41
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,770
by top managers is revealed.

42
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,600
An example of this was the bankruptcy

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,880
of the energy company, Enron that

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,800
was rated investment grade when it

45
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,860
failed after dubious accounting practices were revealed.

46
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,540
Technically, such events are often

47
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,930
incorporated with a jump process that periodically causes asset

48
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,890
values to fall discreetly.

49
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,660
Finally, for highly leveraged firms

50
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,030
such as large financial institutions,

51
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,240
interest rate risk can be a driver of bankruptcy

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,640
and that can be incorporated as a source of risk.

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,090
The KMV model is a widely used extension of the Merton model

54
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,180
that has been commercialized by Moody's.

55
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,450
As in the original Merton model, equity value and equity

56
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,810
volatility, which are inferred from market prices,

57
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,750
are nonlinear functions of the unobservable value

58
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,100
and volatility of firm assets.

59
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,010
The two equations representing those relationships

60
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,850
can be solved simultaneously to infer asset value and asset

61
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,090
volatility given the other inputs.

62
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,180
The main feature distinguishing it from the classic Merton

63
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,240
model is that rather than using the face value of debt

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,940
at maturity as a strike price, there's

65
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,180
a default barrier that's based on a firm's observed capital

66
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,700
structure.

67
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,410
That default barrier --

68
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,110
that can be called a "default point" --

69
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,640
is based on a simple proprietary rule.

70
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,670
For example, in an early technical document

71
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,510
they suggested a good rule is that default occurs when assets

72
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,930
fall below 70% of short-term liabilities,

73
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,210
plus half of long-term book liabilities.

74
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,600
The results of the KMV model are summarized by a measure they

75
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,510
call "distance to default".

76
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,870
The distance to default is the number of standard deviations

77
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,030
the estimated market value currently

78
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,905
is away from the default point.

79
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:45,620


80
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,660
Compared to traditional credit ratings

81
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,500
that fall into discrete buckets, it measures credit risk

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,350
as a continuous variable.

83
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,470
The distance to default doesn't directly

84
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,660
reveal the probability of default

85
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,900
because that would require also knowing the imputed volatility

86
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,030
of assets.

87
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,860
Moody's sells a product that maps

88
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,060
distance to default into an expected frequency of default.

89
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,870
As with other Merton style models, simple implementations

90
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,260
of the KMV model underestimate the near-term likelihood

91
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,209
of default because of the assumption

92
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,540
that assets are following a continuous log-normal process.

93
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,900
Incorporating random jumps in asset value that

94
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,470
may be driven by plus on arrival times of low frequency

95
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,330
adverse events, or making the default barrier stochastic

96
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,370
have been shown to improve the performance of this model.
