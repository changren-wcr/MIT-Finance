1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,940
PROFESSOR: We're now going to turn to standalone

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,130
credit derivatives.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,770
Credit derivatives usually involve two counterparties:

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,410
a protection buyer and a protection seller.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,010
The payoff depends on the behavior of a reference entity,

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,050
for instance whether a guaranteed firm

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,820
defaults on its debt.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,710
As with other derivative transactions,

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,690
credit derivatives are considered a hedge

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,480
when they offset the risk of a cash position.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,510
For example, a commercial bank that lends to Boeing

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,760
might buy protection against a default

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,670
by Boeing using a credit default swap, which

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,490
reduces its net exposure to Boeing credit risk.

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,020
If the protection seller has no other exposure to Boeing,

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,970
it would be speculation that Boeing

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,060
would be unlikely to default over the period covered

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,480
by the protection.

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,330
A credit default swap provides the protection buyer

20
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,430
with a payment in the event of a default

21
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,640
by a reference entity in exchange

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,460
for making a periodic pre-specified payment

23
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,810
to the protection seller.

24
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,530
The periodic fee is a percentage of the notional principle

25
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,770
upon which the insurance is based.

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,830
If instead of paying a fee over time,

27
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,500
the value of the protection is entirely paid for up front,

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,530
then the contract is usually described

29
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,320
as a guarantee or an option rather than as a swap.

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,750
The reference asset or entity could be many things.

31
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,680
It could be a particular loan or the bond of a corporation.

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,100
It could be sovereign debt or a portfolio

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,120
of risky bonds or even another derivatives contract.

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,640
This schematic illustrates the transactions

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,890
between the two counterparties.

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,100
As you can see from the many details on the slide,

37
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,580
there's a wide variety of CDS structures.

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,850
I just want to highlight a few of these points.

39
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,850
A CDS contract always has a fixed maturity

40
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,730
and that need not match the maturity of the reference

41
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,850
entity.

42
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,470
For example, a bank may want protection against default

43
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,530
on a five year loan it's made just for the first year.

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,110
And after that, it prefers to take the credit risk

45
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,580
rather than to pay for offloading it.

46
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,160
A critical element of the CDS contract

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,740
is a precise description of events that trigger a payout.

48
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,820
The term "default", by itself, is too vague

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,980
and standard legal language has evolved

50
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,530
to describe different contingencies.

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,070
Because the list of trigger events in the CDS contract

52
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,350
may not include all eventualities that

53
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,290
would cause a firm to experience financial distress,

54
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,570
the contract might offer less than 100% protection.

55
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,490
Importantly, the trigger events must

56
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,980
be observable and verifiable.

57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,170
Otherwise whether payments are made

58
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,690
can involve a lot of legal complications.

59
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,920
A contract also specifies the type of settlement.

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,190
With cash settlement, when there is a default event,

61
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,980
the protection buyer receives the difference between what's

62
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,940
owed and the market value of the reference asset at the time

63
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,710
of the trigger event.

64
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,530
With physical delivery, the protection buyer

65
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,430
delivers the reference asset or assets to the protection seller

66
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,350
and, in return, receives what's owed.

67
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,230
Physical delivery avoids the need

68
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,360
to find a market value when one is not readily available

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,360
but it necessitates obtaining and delivering

70
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,210
the asset, which may not be easy or even feasible in some cases.

71
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,870
CDSes that are digitally settled involve a predetermined

72
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,530
fixed payment if there's a trigger event.

73
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,550
An organization that seeks to promulgate standards to ensure

74
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,340
that the CDS market functions smoothly

75
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,210
is called the International Swap Dealers Association or ISDA.

76
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,500
A CDS contract can be based on a single firm or name

77
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,450
as the reference entity.

78
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,660
It can also be written on a basket of multiple firms

79
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,910
or on a broader credit performance index

80
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,560
for various regions.

81
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,920
Index-based CDS are popular because of their liquidity

82
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,290
and ease of obtaining the relevant information

83
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,029
to determine payoffs.

84
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,450
They're collectively referred to as CDX.

85
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,930
CDS and indices are also frequently used as inputs

86
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,710
into structured products such as synthetic collateralized debt

87
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,710
obligations or nth to default bonds.

88
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,530
Those are contracts we'll talk about more next time.

89
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,170
Let's look more closely at the cash flows associated

90
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,450
with a single name CDS and let's assume it's cash settled.

91
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,620
The protection buyer pays a periodic premium called U

92
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,470
on a notional principal amount of protection

93
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,240
for a period of length T, say on $100

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,510
face value of the underlying entity's debt.

95
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,520
In the event that the underlying entity

96
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,490
defaults on the debt at some time tau, which

97
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,210
is less than or equal to the maturity date of the contract,

98
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,030
and assuming the recovery amount is

99
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,530
Y of tau for $100 of face value, then the protection buyer

100
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,900
is made whole on the default date

101
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,550
and receives a payment of 100 minus Y of tau.

102
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,190
An analysis of a long-short portfolio

103
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,010
that consists of a risky bond and a risk-free bond

104
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,520
of equal value establishes that the premium rate on a credit

105
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,380
default swap should be approximately

106
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,030
equal to the credit spread on the risky bond.

107
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,810
That's why the principle of no arbitrage.

108
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,260
To see why, let's consider an example that's

109
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,600
illustrated by this diagram.

110
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,330
It shows that the cash flows associated

111
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,430
with a long position in a risk-free bond

112
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:57,960
with price, P and a short position

113
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,380
in a risky bond with price, P results

114
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,520
in net cash flows that are the same as on a credit default

115
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,680
swap.

116
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,910
Specifically, we assume that both bonds are priced at par

117
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,240
and pay a periodic coupon rate.

118
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,750
s is the dollar credit spread on the risky bond

119
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,410
and r is the dollar risk-free rate.

120
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,250
Assume too that default will only

121
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,890
occur on the maturity date of the bond.

122
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,720
The diagram shows that the net cash

123
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,950
flow of this portfolio each period prior to maturity

124
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,930
is minus s because the r's cancel out.

125
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:51,330
At maturity, the net payoff is P minus the recovery rate.

126
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,850
Those cash flows are identical to having

127
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,500
a long position in a credit default

128
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,210
swap on the bond with a premium rate equal to s.

129
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,230
Now if the CDS rate, U, is higher than s,

130
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,430
it's an arbitrage opportunity to write a CDS

131
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,890
and create a long-short portfolio that

132
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,620
hedges the associated risk.

133
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,390
Conversely, if the CDS rate, U, were lower than s,

134
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,030
there's an arbitrage opportunity involving

135
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,240
a long position in the CDS, again hedging

136
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,000
with a long-short portfolio.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,270
In practice, there are two main approaches used in CDS pricing.

138
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,860
The first, which is preferred because it's more accurate,

139
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,720
is to price CDS using an extension of the Burton model.

140
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,350
The AWA example can be easily modified, for instance,

141
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,950
to price CDS.

142
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,320
The second approach follows the logic

143
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,470
of the long-short portfolio, no arbitrage pricing,

144
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,490
on the previous slide.

145
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,480
However, there are a number of unrealistic assumptions

146
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,417
that are needed to make that argument rigorous.

147
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:02,250
And those are mentioned in the bullet points

148
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,510
here in case you're interested in seeing them.

149
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,970
Well, despite a long-short portfolio

150
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,360
not truly being a perfect hedge for a CDS position,

151
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,030
traders often looked for arbitrage opportunities

152
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,110
between the CDS and cash markets by comparing CDS premiums

153
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,450
with the yield spreads in the cash market

154
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,910
and taking positions that will profit

155
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,135
if the pricing between the cash and the CDS market converge.

156
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:29,880


157
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,340
Multiname CDS is common.

158
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,470
To see why, consider an investor who's

159
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,900
holding a portfolio of defaultable bonds

160
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,030
and wants to buy insurance against default

161
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,679
losses on that portfolio.

162
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,750
The investor could choose between buying

163
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,050
an individual CDS for the bonds in the portfolio

164
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,570
or purchasing insurance on the portfolio overall.

165
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,010
Which do you think is more expensive?

166
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,110
To answer this, think back to our discussion

167
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,610
of exotic options.

168
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,490
In particular, we determined that Asian options that

169
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,010
have a payoff based on average outcomes

170
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,010
are less expensive than otherwise similar options

171
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,100
because averaging or diversification narrows

172
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,170
the variance of outcomes.

173
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,960
A portfolio of bonds diversifies credit risk

174
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,450
relative to individual bond holdings

175
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,870
and buying a CDS based on the default losses on a portfolio

176
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,330
is typically then much less expensive

177
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,700
than buying protection for each individual bond

178
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,330
in the portfolio.

179
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,580
An even less expensive form of protection

180
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,470
is to limit it to events that involve

181
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,810
some large number of defaults.

182
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,730
That can be attractive when an investor

183
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,160
has some tolerance for risk but wants protection

184
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,370
against severe default events such as those that might occur

185
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,500
during a financial crisis.

186
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,290
An n-th to default basket default swap

187
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,080
offers such protection, providing a payoff

188
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,710
only after the n-th default occurs in a basket of reference

189
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,550
securities.

190
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,440
The premium paid for this protection

191
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,540
depends on several factors.

192
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,990
With a larger number of credits in the basket, all else equal,

193
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,990
it's more likely that n will default.

194
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,180
That raises the price of the insurance.

195
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,570
The credit quality and anticipated recovery rates

196
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,270
also influence pricing.

197
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,130
Finally, and also very importantly,

198
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,610
the distribution of the number of defaults

199
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,370
is very sensitive to the pairwise correlation

200
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,500
between the likelihood of default for the reference

201
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,670
entities.

202
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,550
We'll return to the effects of default correlation

203
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,770
and how it affects pricing next week.

204
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,450
This week you've learned a lot about how

205
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,430
statistical and structural models are

206
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,170
used to price credit risk.

207
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,790
We started with a statistical approach,

208
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,390
which derives default and recovery rates from data

209
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,080
on borrower characteristics that include leverage ratios, credit

210
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,360
ratings, tangible collateral, and so forth.

211
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,960
We then turn to structural models,

212
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,540
which infer default and recovery rates based

213
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,720
on the stochastic structure of a borrower's assets

214
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,210
and an assumed default barrier.

215
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,940
Both approaches predict the effect of credit risk

216
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,050
on the value of credit sensitive securities and derivatives.

217
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,920
For defaultable bonds, both should produce similar answers

218
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,880
if they're properly calibrated.

219
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,090
However, I emphasize the structural approach

220
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,270
because it's more flexible and it's much better

221
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,960
suited for pricing more complex credit derivatives.

222
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,170
In practice, hybrids of the two approaches

223
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,730
often produce the most accurate results.

224
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,000
