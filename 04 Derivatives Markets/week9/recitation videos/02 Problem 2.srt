1
00:00:00,746 --> 00:00:05,070
PROFESSOR: All right, let's move on to problem two.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,110
Problem 2 states that your firm owns 1,000 shares of ABC stock

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,700
and is now seeking a loan using the stock as collateral.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,540
The current market price of the stock is $80 per share.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,490
And you have just been offered a loan

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,510
of $80,000, the full current value of the stock

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,590
at an interest rate of 25% per period.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,259
At the end of each of the next two periods,

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,190
your firm will owe an interest payment of $20,000.

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,250
The first payment is due one period from now.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,970
The principal on the loan is due three periods from now.

12
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,130
So at that time your firm will own

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,220
a total payment of $100,000.

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,420
The 1,000 shares of stock will serve as the sole collateral

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,020
for the loan.

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,910
If your firm defaults on any of its payments,

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,900
the lender will immediately take possession of the stock

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,150
but will have no further claim on any

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,860
of your firm's other assets.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,080
A default on this special arrangement

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,380
will have no effect whatsoever on the other activities

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,010
of the firm.

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,530


24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,940
The APC stock pays no dividends, and over each period,

25
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,980
its value will either increase by 50% or decrease by 50%

26
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,020
with the risk neutral probability

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,870
of an up move equal to 60%.

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,960
Equivalently, the risk neutral probability of a down move

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,960
is equal to 40%.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,340
The interest rate on default free, risk free loans

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,290
is 10% per period.

32
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,790
Is this loan an attractive opportunity for your firm?

33
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,990
First, consider the value of a default free bond

34
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,490
that has the same promise payments as the proposed loan.

35
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,950
Its value would be equal to the $20,000 interest payment one

36
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,420
period from now discounted at the 10% default free

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,020
or risk free interest rate plus the $20,000 interest

38
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,540
payment two periods from now discounted

39
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:20,330
at 10% plus the $100,000 face value of the default free bond

40
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:27,320
discounted at 10%, which is equal to $109,842, which

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,830
is substantially greater than the $80,000

42
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,160
that your firm would receive for undertaking the same promised

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,180
payments with the proposed loan.

44
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,040
However, your firm would also have a valuable option

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,620
to cancel the proposed loan at any time

46
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,030
by surrendering the underlying collateral, the ABC stock.

47
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,360
Defaulting in this way would be in the firm's interest

48
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,510
whenever the value of the remaining payments on the loan

49
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,340
exceeds the value of the collateral.

50
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,760
Thus, the proper value of the remaining payments

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,090
must reflect the fact that even if the current payment

52
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,020
on the loan is made, default may still occur on one or more

53
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,030
of the future payments.

54
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,720
Thus, the current value of the remaining payments of the loan

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,770
will depend on the value of the collateral.

56
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,920
Since we have a binomial model, the following diagram

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,130
shows the possible prices for the underlying collateral,

58
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,720
the 1,000 shares of ABC stock over the next three periods

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,020
along with the corresponding possible values of the loan

60
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,900
at its maturity date.

61
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,100
This is this last column on the right here.

62
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,720
The last three values in that column 90, 30, and 10 reflect

63
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,170
the fact that default will occur in those circumstances

64
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,620
because the value of the underlying collateral of 90,

65
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,450
30, and 10 is less than the face value of the loan of 100.

66
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,940
All values in the diagram are in thousands

67
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,940
of dollars for simplicity.

68
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,970
As always, with the binomial tree,

69
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,890
we solve the problem by working backwards.

70
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,200
Let V of S and n be the value of the current and future payments

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,700
on the loan in thousands of dollars

72
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,550
when the stock price is equal to S,

73
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:23,730
and there are end periods remaining until maturity.

74
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,790
Beginning with the n equals one case,

75
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,000
that is these three nodes here, we have the following.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
The value of the current and future payments on the loans

77
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,240
in the node of the binomial tree when the stock

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,230
price is equal to 180.

79
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,930
And there's one period remaining, this node here,

80
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,800
is equal to the minimum of 180, the value

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,550
of the underlying collateral, and 20, the interest

82
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,450
payment in that period plus 60%, which

83
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,190
is the risk neutral probability of an up move times 100, which

84
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,360
is the value of the loan in the terminal node here

85
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,950
plus 40% risk neutral probability of a down move

86
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:21,960
times 90, the value of the loan in this terminal node here

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,010
discounted at the risk free rate of 10%, which

88
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,880
is equal to 107.27.

89
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,270
In the node of the binomial tree when the underlying stock is

90
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,040
equal to 60 with one period remaining,

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,840
this node here, the value of the current and future payments

92
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,800
on the loan is equal to the minimum of 60,

93
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,630
the value of the underlying collateral,

94
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:56,920
and 20, the interest payment plus 60% times now 90,

95
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:03,500
which is the value of the loan in this node here

96
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:10,730
plus 40% times 30, the value of the loan in this node here

97
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,020
discounted at 10%, which is equal to 60.

98
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,790
A similar calculation for the node

99
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,550
of the tree when the value of the underlying stock

100
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,730
is equal to 20 with one period remaining,

101
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,150
this node here, suggests that the value

102
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,700
of the current and future payments on the loan

103
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,510
at that node is equal to 20.

104
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,110
Thus, the optimal choice for the firm

105
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,700
is to default on the loan at the nodes where S equals 60 or 20

106
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,760
at n equals 1, these two here.

107
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,310
Now, we can do a similar calculation

108
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,740
for the n equals 2 case, that is when there

109
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,880
are two periods remaining until maturity, which corresponds

110
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,450
to these two nodes here on the binomial tree

111
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,780
and find that the value of the current and future payments

112
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,200
on the loan at the node of the tree where the stock price is

113
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,230
120 is equal to the minimum of 120,

114
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,650
value of the underlying collateral,

115
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,300
and 20, the interest payment plus 60% the risk neutral

116
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,220
probability of an up move times 107.27.

117
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,950
Which is the value of the current and future payments

118
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:32,530
on the loan at this node here, the up node from 120 plus 40%

119
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,170
the risk neutral probability of a down move

120
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,740
times 60 the value of the current and future payments

121
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:46,460
on the loan at this node here discounted

122
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:53,040
at the risk free rate of 10%, which is equal to 100.33.

123
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,780
A similar calculation for the node

124
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,070
of the tree where the underlying stock price is equal to 40

125
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,520
gives a value of 40.

126
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,740
Thus, the optimal choice for the firm

127
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,430
is to default on the loan at the node where S equals 40 at n

128
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:14,500
equals 2 since this is less than the face value of 100.

129
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,170
Finally, at the initial node of the tree,

130
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:22,825
that is when n equals 3 and S is equal to 80, this node here.

131
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:25,650


132
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,550
The value of the current and future payments on the loan

133
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,510
is equal to the minimum of the underlying asset price of 80

134
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,330
plus the risk neutral probability of an up

135
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:41,120
move times the value of the current and future payments

136
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,750
on the loan in the subsequent up node, which we found

137
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,340
was 100.33, plus the risk neutral probability

138
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,310
of a down move times 40.

139
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,230
The value of the current and future payments

140
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,050
on the loan and the subsequent down node,

141
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,380
which we just found here, discounted at the risk

142
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:09,800
free rate of 10%, which is equal to 69.27, or $69,270.

143
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,520
So overall, the loan is actually an attractive opportunity

144
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,960
for your firm.

145
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,800
You have been offered $80,000 for a series

146
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,170
of contingent future payments that

147
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,060
has a current fair value of only $69,270.

148
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,600
And that's a really good deal.
