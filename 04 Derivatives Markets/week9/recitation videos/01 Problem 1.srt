1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,300
PROFESSOR: Without further ado, let's begin with problem one.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,410
Problem one says to consider two 7% annual coupon

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,610
corporate bonds each with one year until maturity.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,790
Both bonds are expected to default with a 20% probability.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,270
Investors demand a risk adjusted expected return

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,310
of 4.5% on both bonds, and the only difference between the two

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,370
bonds is that, in the event of default,

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,340
the expected recovery rate on the first bond

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,760
is 75% whereas the expected recovery

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,180
rate on the second bond is 25%.

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,080


12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,140
Use this information to estimate the difference

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,320
in the quoted yields to maturity between the two bonds.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,660


15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,700
Well, before we solve the problem,

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,570
let's first get some notation out of the way.

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,560
Let P sub 1 be the value of the first bond that

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,890
has the expected recovery rate of 75%,

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,340
and P sub 2 be the value of the second bond

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,000
with the expected recovery rate of 25%.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
Assume that both bonds in this example

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,940
have a face value of 100.

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,020
Since there's one year until maturity on both bonds,

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,850
the holder of each bond will receive its face value of 100

25
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,970
plus a terminal coupon payment of 7

26
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,770
if the bond doesn't default, which occurs 100 minus 20,

27
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,770
which is equal to 80% of the time.

28
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,880
If the first bond defaults, then the holder of the bond will

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,250
receive 75% --

30
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,050
the expected recovery rate --

31
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,910
times the terminal payoff of 100 of the face value

32
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:55,790
plus the terminal coupon of 7, which is equal to 80.25.

33
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,310
On the other hand if the second bond defaults,

34
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,610
the holder of the bond will receive 25% --

35
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,560
it's expected recovery rate --

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,419
times 107, which is equal to 26.75.

37
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,500
Thus, we can solve for P1, the price of the first bond,

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,130
as 0.8, which is the probability that the bond doesn't default,

39
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,440
times 107, its terminal payoff, discounted at the risk adjusted

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,400
interest rate of 4.5%, plus 0.2, the probability

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,120
that the bond does default, times its expected recovery

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,330
rate of 75% times it's terminal payoff of 107,

43
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,610
also discounted at the risk adjusted

44
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:52,800
interest rate of 4.5%, which is equal to 97.273.

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,100
A similar calculation for the price of the second bond

46
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,760
yields a price of 87.033.

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,580
The only difference here is that now the expected recovery

48
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:10,670
rate if the bond does default is equal to 25% rather than 75%.

49
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,060
Finally, we can find the yield-to-maturity of each bond

50
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,430
as follows.

51
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,550
The yield-to-maturity, for instance on the first bond,

52
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,160
is the single interest rate that equates

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,620
the present value of the bond on the left hand

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,760
side with its price.

55
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
Solving the first equation for Y1,

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,140
we find that the yield to maturity

57
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,890
on the first bond that has the higher expected recovery rate

58
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,330
is 10%.

59
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,230
A similar calculation shows that the yield

60
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,790
to maturity on the second bond that has the lower recovery

61
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,780
rate is 22.94.

62
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,690
Thus, the difference between these two yields is 12.94.

63
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,580
Intuitively, the higher yield on the second bond,

64
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,300
that is, the bond with the lower recovery rate,

65
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,500
reflects its greater credit risk.

66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,000
