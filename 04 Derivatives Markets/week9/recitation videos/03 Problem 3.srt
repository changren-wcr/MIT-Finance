00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900


1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,410
All right, let's move on to Problem 3.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,030
Problem 3 says to consider a risky one-year zero-coupon bond

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,760
priced to yield 6.375% on a bond equivalent basis,

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,270
where, recall from the Week 3 recitation, that a bond

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,540
equivalent yield is the single interest rate that

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,330
equates the price of a bond to the present value

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,870
of its future cash flows but assumes semiannual compounding.

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,220
At the same time, the one-year spot yield on a Treasury bill

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,230
is 2.3% on a bond equivalent basis.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,790
A credit default swap is available on the risky bond.

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,850
The upfront premium for the credit default swap

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:56,030
is $4,500 per $100,000 face value of the risky bond.

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,580
In Part A, we are asked, does there

14
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,970
appear to be an arbitrage opportunity between the cash

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,160
and CDS markets?

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,290
Explain with a calculation.

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,210
First, the value of the risky one-year zero-coupon bond

18
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,480
is equal to the $100,000 face value discounted at 1

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,270
plus the 6.375% yield to maturity expressed a decimal.

20
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,230
And since it's on a bond equivalent basis, that

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,530
is it assumes semiannual compounding,

22
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,250
we take the yield to maturity divided by 2

23
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:44,600
and adjust the time unit, which gives us $93,917.35.

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,880
A similar calculation could be used

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,150
to find the value of the risk-free one-year Treasury

26
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:56,390
bond as the face value of $100,000 discounted

27
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,790
at the 2.3% risk-free yield to maturity on the bond.

28
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,020
And, again, because it's on a bond equivalent basis,

29
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,070
we divide the yield by 2 and adjust the time unit

30
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:19,880
for semiannual coupons, which is equal to $97,739.08.

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,880
As we saw in the Week 9 lecture, the difference

32
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,420
between the risk-free bond price, this one here,

33
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,690
and the risky bond price, here, is

34
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,990
equal to the fair price of the credit default swap

35
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:41,180
premium, which in this case is equal to $3,821.73.

36
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,960
Thus, there appears to be an arbitrage opportunity

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,550
as the credit default swap is selling for $4,500

38
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,430
and appears to be relatively overpriced

39
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,130
relative to its fair value of $3,821.

40
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,220
Part B asks, describe the transactions

41
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,620
that you would have to simultaneously make

42
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,470
in both the cash and the CDS markets

43
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,400
in order to exploit this arbitrage opportunity.

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,650
Well, since the CDS is overpriced

45
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,040
relative to its fair value, the most straightforward way

46
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,730
to structure the transactions is to do the following.

47
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,450
First, sell the credit default swap.

48
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,500
Second, purchase a one-year Treasury bill with face value

49
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,320
equal to $100,000.

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,190
And, third, short the risky one-year zero-coupon bond

51
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,970
with face value equal to $100,000.

52
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,730
The upfront profit from this strategy

53
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:53,120
is equal to the $4,500 from selling the CDS minus $97,739

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,170
from purchasing the one-year Treasury bill plus $93,917

55
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,130
from shorting the risky one-year zero-coupon bond, which

56
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,530
is equal to $678.27.

57
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,860
Notice that this strategy has zero future cash flows

58
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,720
paid or received from the strategy.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,079
So it's certainly an arbitrage opportunity

60
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,580
with a positive payoff initially and no possibility

61
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,890
of paying money in the future.

62
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,580
Why is this the case?

63
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,020
Well, if the risky bond defaults,

64
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,300
that is the risky bond that we shorted,

65
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,370
then the credit default swap payment

66
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,620
is covered by the difference between the face

67
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,410
value of the Treasury bill and the recovery

68
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,240
value of the risky bond.

69
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,980
If the risky bond, on the other hand, doesn't default,

70
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,810
then the credit default swap pays

71
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,800
nothing and the face values of the one year Treasury bill

72
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,010
of $100,000 and the risky one-year zero-coupon bond

73
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,290
cancel out on both the long and short positions.
