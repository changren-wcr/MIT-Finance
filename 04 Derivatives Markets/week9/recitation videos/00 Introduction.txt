JR SCOTT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the ninth recitation
of 15.435x.
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing material related
to the week nine lecture.
In particular, we'll be reviewing four problems.
In the first problem, we'll see a simple example
of how the yield to maturity of a bond
is affected by its credit risk.
In the second problem, we'll see how
to value a loan using the binomial model.
In the third problem, we'll see a simple example of pricing
a credit default swap.
And finally, in the fourth problem,
we'll see how we can value a credit
guarantee on a risky bond using Merton's model.
