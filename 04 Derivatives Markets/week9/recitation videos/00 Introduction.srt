JR SCOTT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the ninth recitation

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,620
of 15.435x.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,920
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing material related

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,070
to the week nine lecture.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,590
In particular, we'll be reviewing four problems.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,640
In the first problem, we'll see a simple example

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,890
of how the yield to maturity of a bond

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,450
is affected by its credit risk.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,340
In the second problem, we'll see how

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,350
to value a loan using the binomial model.

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,040
In the third problem, we'll see a simple example of pricing

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,500
a credit default swap.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,930
And finally, in the fourth problem,

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,060
we'll see how we can value a credit

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,500
guarantee on a risky bond using Merton's model.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,000
