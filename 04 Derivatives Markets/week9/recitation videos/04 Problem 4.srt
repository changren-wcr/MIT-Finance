1
00:00:01,707 --> 00:00:03,290
PROFESSOR: That does it for Problem 3.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,550
Let's finish the recitation by reviewing Problem 4.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,910
In Problem 4, it stated that your boss asks you

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,580
for a quick price estimate for a credit

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,200
guarantee on the risky bond of a publicly traded firm.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,600
You have the following information.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,750
First, that the Treasury yield curve

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,620
is flat at 4% on a continuous basis.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,310
Second, the bond to be guaranteed a zero coupon

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,540
and has a face value of $50 million.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,176
It matures in 3.25 years and it is the only debt of the firm.

12
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:42,510
The credit guarantee ensures payment

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,100
to the holder of the full face value at maturity.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,920
Third the firm has 5.11 million shares of equity outstanding

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,270
currently priced at $10.69 per share.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,562
The equity volatility is 25% per year.

17
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,340
And fourth, using the Merton model for valuing risky debt,

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,750
you conclude that the market value of assets is $95 million

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:17,290
and the asset volatility is 12% per year.

20
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,780
Based on all this information, what

21
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,690
is your best estimate of the value of the credit guarantee?

22
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,360
Now, this problem is tricky because although we

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,430
threw a lot of information at you,

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,970
you actually don't need to apply either the Merton model

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,120
or to build a binomial tree in order to solve the problem.

26
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,920
The first step in solving the problem

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,890
is to simply recall from the Week 9 lecture

28
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,890
that the Merton model relies on the relationship

29
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,150
that A equals E plus D, where A is the market

30
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,450
value of the firm's assets, E is the market value

31
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,020
of the firm's equity, and D is the market value

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,990
of the firm's debt.

33
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,330
From the information provided, we

34
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,880
can compute the market value of the firm's equity,

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,060
or E, to be equal to $10.69, the price per share,

36
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,340
times 5.11 million shares outstanding,

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,615
which is equal to $54.519 million.

38
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:25,250
Since the market value of the firm's assets is $95 million

39
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,000
according to the Merton model, we

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,500
can infer that D, which is equal to A minus E,

41
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,160
is equal to $95 million minus $54.519 million,

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:46,226
which is equal to $40.481 million.

43
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:49,280
Now, as we saw in the Week 9 lecture,

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,060
the value of a credit guarantee on a risky bond

45
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,870
is equal to the difference between the hypothetical price

46
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,830
of the promised payments of the bond,

47
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,520
if they were, in fact, risk-free,

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,530
and the price of the risky bond.

49
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,260


50
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,130
If the firm's debt were in fact risk-free,

51
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,265
then its price would be equal to 50--

52
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:15,790
so the $50 million face value the bond--

53
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,780
times the exponential of negative 0.04,

54
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,220
since the risk-free rate is 4% on a continuous basis, times

55
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,130
3.25, since the debt has 3.25 years to maturity, which

56
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,740
is equal to $43.905 million.

57
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,100
Thus, the credit guarantee is estimated

58
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:47,050
to be worth 43.905 minus 40.481, that's the market

59
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,600
value of the firm's debt according

60
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,250
to the Merton model, which is equal to $3.424 million.

61
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,070
Pretty simple, right?

62
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,270
All right, that concludes Problem 4 and the Week 9

63
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,380
recitation.

64
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,020
Thank you everyone for coming and I look forward

65
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,520
to seeing you one more time next week.
