00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,480
PROFESSOR: OK, now that we reviewed some popular options

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,130
strategies, let's review risk-neutral pricing.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,500
Recall from the week 4 lecture that there

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,170
are two main conceptual frameworks for pricing

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,150
derivative securities.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,150
The first is replicating portfolios

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,650
and the second is risk-neutral pricing.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,810
What is risk-neutral pricing?

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,810
Well, risk-neutral, pricing states that the price of any

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,440
derivative security is equal to the expectation of its

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,120
discounted future payoffs, where the expectation is computed

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,320
using the so-called risk-neutral probabilities that assume that

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,270
investors are risk-neutral --

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,160
that is not risk averse --

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,400
and discounting is at the risk-free rate.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,600
In particular, the price of the derivative security is equal

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,810
to the risk-neutral expectation, E*,

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,690
of the payoff of the security at maturity date,

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,910
T discounted at the risk-free rate, r.

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,800
In the lecture notes, we saw an example

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,510
of how risk-neutral pricing could

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,860
be used to find the price of a call option.

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,350
Can we similarly use risk-neutral pricing

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,200
to find the price of a put option?

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,130
Suppose that the price of the stock evolves as follows.

26
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,020
In the initial node at T equals 0, the stock price is 50.

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,200
In the two subsequent nodes at T equals 1,

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,480
the stock price is 70 in the up node and 35 in the down node.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,540
Assume that the risk-free rate is 11%.

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,640
Using risk-neutral pricing, what would

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,210
be the price of a put option on the stock with maturity,

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,860
T equals 1 and strike price, K equals 50?

33
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,370
As a first step, we can find the risk-neutral probability,

34
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,140
call it q*, that the up node occurs at T equals 1

35
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,890
as follows.

36
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,580
S0, the initial stock price is equal to q*,

37
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,030
the risk-neutral probability that the up node occurs at time

38
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,910
T equals 1, times S1,u, the stock price in the up node at T

39
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,690
equals 1 discounted at the risk-free rate,

40
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,380
plus the risk-neutral probability that the down node

41
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,690
occurs at T equals 1, 1 minus q* times the stock price

42
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,580
in the down node at T equals 1, S1,d discounted

43
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,190
at the risk-free rate.

44
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,090
Solving that equation for q*, we see that the risk-neutral

45
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:43,000
probability is equal to the initial stock price S0 times e

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,320
to the power of r times t minus the stock price in the down

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,150
node at T equals 1, S1,d, divided by the difference

48
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,290
in the stock prices in the up node and the down node.

49
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,340
Plugging in for the value of the initial stock price a time

50
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,860
T equals 0 of 50, the value of the stock at time T

51
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,740
equals 1 in the down of 35, the value of the stock at time T

52
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,720
equals 1 in the up node of 70, the risk-free rate of 11%

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,650
expressed as a decimal, and the maturity of the put option at T

54
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,360
equals 1 into equation 1 for the risk-neutral probability.

55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,880
We see that the risk-neutral probability

56
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,980
of the up node occurring at time T

57
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:36,010
equals 1 is equal to 0.5947, or 59.47%.

58
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,990
According to the diagram provided,

59
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,110
the payoff of the put option is equal to 0

60
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,870
in the up node at time T equals 1,

61
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,320
and the maximum of the difference between the strike

62
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,140
price of the put option, K, and the stock

63
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,110
price in the down node at time T equals 1,

64
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,840
and 0, which is equal to 15, in the down node.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,080
Finally, we can compute the price of the put option

66
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,590
by simply applying the risk-neutral pricing formula.

67
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,530
Recall that the price of the put option is equal

68
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,340
to the expectation of its payoff according to the risk-neutral

69
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,459
measure E*, discounted at the risk-free rate,

70
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,610
which is equal to e to the negative 0.11 times

71
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,190
the risk-neutral probability q* of an up node at time T equals

72
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,810
1 times the payoff of the put option in the up node a time T

73
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,550
equals 1, which is 0, plus the risk-neutral probability

74
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,870
of the down node at time T equals 1, 1 minus q*,

75
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,990
times the payoff of the put option in the down node of 15,

76
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,850
which equals 5.4462.

77
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,710
We said that risk-neutral pricing

78
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,380
could be used to price any derivative,

79
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,120
not just call and put options.

80
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,930
One example of a derivative that we've seen before in this class

81
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,760
is a forward contract.

82
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,700
Recall that a forward contract is an agreement between two

83
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,200
parties to either buy or sell an underlying asset on an agreed

84
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,650
upon date and price.

85
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,040
In the week 1 lecture, we saw that the forward price

86
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,500
of a non-dividend paying stock is given

87
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,420
by the following equation.

88
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,110
F0 T, which is the forward price for a contract that

89
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,670
expires at maturity date, T is equal to the current price

90
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:36,500
of the stock, S sub 0, times e to the r times T. Can

91
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,820
we derive the same formula using risk-neutral pricing instead?

92
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,150
The first thing to notice is that the profit at maturity

93
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,990
date, T from a long position in the forward contract

94
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,870
is given by the difference between the stock price

95
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,620
at maturity date T, ST and the forward price,

96
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,480
F0 T. Since it costs nothing to enter

97
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,990
into the forward contract, the value of this contract

98
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,010
must be equal to 0 at its initiation.

99
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,430
Thus, the risk-neutral expectation

100
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,710
of the profit from a long position

101
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,080
in the forward contract discounted

102
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,980
at the risk-free rate must be equal to 0.

103
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,520
Rearranging this equation, we see that the forward price

104
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,000
is equal to the risk-neutral expectation of the stock

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,800
price at the maturity date, T. Recall

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,340
that in a risk-neutral world, the return on any stock

107
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,870
is equal to the risk-free rate.

108
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,300
In the case of a non-dividend paying stock,

109
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,590
this implies that the initial price of the stock as 0

110
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,730
is equal to the risk-neutral expectation of the stock price

111
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,150
at date T, discounted at the risk-free rate.

112
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,340
Combining these two equations, we

113
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,500
arrive at the exact same expression

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,920
for the forward price of a non-dividend paying stock

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,320
as we did in the week 1 lecture.

116
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,800
From the first equation, we know that the forward price is

117
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,680
equal to the risk-neutral expectation of the stock

118
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,100
price at the maturity date T. And by rearranging

119
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,810
the second equation, bringing the exponential of negative r

120
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,050
times T to the other side, we know

121
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,010
that the risk-neutral expectation of the stock

122
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,390
price of maturity date T is equal to the current value

123
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:36,590
of the stock price, S0 times e to the r times T.

124
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,010
The big picture takeaway here is that the forward price

125
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,630
of the stock is the risk-neutral expectation of the underlying

126
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,440
asset value at time T.

127
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,000
