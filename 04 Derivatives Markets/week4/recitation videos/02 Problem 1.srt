1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,460
PROFESSOR: Without further ado, let's

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,660
begin by reviewing some options strategies.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,990
As mentioned by Professor Lucas during the week four lecture,

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,230
a bull spread is an options trading strategy

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,620
designed to profit from the rise in the price of a stock--

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,080
hence "bull" rather than "bear."

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,150
In the lecture notes, we saw an example

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,820
of a bull call spread, which involved

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,570
the simultaneous purchase and sale of call options

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,880
with different strike prices.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,537
In this case, an investor pays money upfront and profits later

12
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:36,745
when the call options expire.

13
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,430


14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,600
Well, we could have easily have used a bull put spread, which

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,180
instead involves the simultaneous purchase

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,000
and sale of put options.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,150
Specifically, in a bull put spread,

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,050
the investor purchases one out-of-the-money put option

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,270
with strike price K1, and sells an in-the-money put option with

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,150
strike price K2, where K2 is greater than K1.

21
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,410
Recall, on the other hand, that a bear spread involves selling

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,820
out-of-the-money put option with strike price K1 and purchasing

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,940
an in-the-money put option with strike price K2,

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,640
where K2 is greater than K1.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,120
A bear spread is a bet that the stock price will fall,

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,060
as opposed to a bull spread, which is a bet that the stock

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,100
price will increase.

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,640
Thus, a bull put spread has payoffs

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,550
like that of a short position in a bear spread.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,500
But in order to yield the same payoff as the bull call spread,

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,530
a bull put spread also involves, in addition

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,020
to the short position in the bear spread,

33
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,100
the simultaneous purchase of a zero coupon bond with face

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,720
value equal to K2 minus K1.

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,920
Why is this the case?

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,160
Well, recall from put-call parity

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,250
that given the price of a European call option,

38
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,520
we can always find the price of an equivalent European put

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,850
option as follows in the equation below.

40
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,480
On the left-hand side, Put is the price of the European put

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,980
option, S0 is the spot price of the underlying stock

42
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,000
at the initiation of the put or call option,

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,750
Call is the price of the call option, and this last term--

44
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,720
e to the negative r times t times k--

45
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,870
is the price of a zero coupon bond with face value

46
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,460
K and interest rate r.

47
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,850
In other words, the payoff of a portfolio consisting

48
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,610
of a call option and a zero coupon bond

49
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,800
with face value K and interest rate

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,530
r, the right-hand side of this equation,

51
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,290
is the same as that of a portfolio consisting

52
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,050
of a put option and the underlying stock,

53
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,600
the left-hand side of the equation.

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,550
The figure below displays the payoff

55
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,920
of the bull put spread as a function

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,330
of the underlying stock price and maturity.

57
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,140
To reiterate, the payoff of the bull put spread, this dark,

58
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,130
black line, is the sum of the payoff of a long position

59
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,770
in the out-of-the-money put, a long position in a bond with

60
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,970
face value K2 minus K1, and a short position

61
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,810
in the in-the-money put option.

62
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,930
In addition to the bull spread, one of the other options

63
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,510
trading strategies that Professor Lucas mentioned

64
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,350
during the week four lecture is the butterfly spread.

65
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,680
Recall that a butterfly spread is a trading strategy that

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,950
combines bull and bear spreads to create

67
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,100
a market-neutral position with capped profits and losses.

68
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,170
In the week four lecture, we saw how

69
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,770
to create a butterfly spread using a combination of four

70
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,760
call options.

71
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,940
Equivalently, we can construct the same butterfly

72
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,120
spread using a combination of four put options.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,140
The four options are first, a long position in one

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,110
put option with strike price K0, second, a short position in two

75
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,430
put options with strike price K1 and third,

76
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,660
a long position in one put option with strike price K2

77
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,760
where K0 is less than K1 which in turn is less than K2,

78
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,500
and K1 is equal to the average of the strike prices K0 and K2.

79
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,660
Specifically, the above strategy is a long put butterfly spread

80
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,100
created by buying one put with a lower strike price, K0,

81
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,780
selling two at-the-money puts with strike price, K1,

82
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,650
and buying one put with a higher strike price, K2.

83
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,400
This position is going to achieve its maximum payoff when

84
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,680
the underlying stock price remains

85
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,810
at the strike price, K1, of the intermediate options.

86
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,790
The figure below displays the payoff

87
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,090
of the long put butterfly spread as a function

88
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,220
of the underlying stock price and maturity.

89
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,390
To reiterate, the payoff of the long put butterfly spread

90
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,050
is composed of the payoffs of the two long positions

91
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,350
in the put options with strike price K0 and K2,

92
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,560
and the payoff of the short position in two

93
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,620
put options with strike price K1.

94
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,310
Notice we get the same dark, black, butterfly spread payoff

95
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,820
as we did in the long call butterfly spread discussed

96
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,470
in the week four lecture notes.

97
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,290
Now hypothetically, what would happen

98
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,270
if we reverse the positions in the long put butterfly spread?

99
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,380
In particular, say we enter into the following three positions--

100
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,710
first, a short position in one put option

101
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,970
with strike price, K0, second, a long position

102
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,350
in two put options with strike price, K1, and third,

103
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,370
a short position in one option with strike price, K2,

104
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:10,680
where K0, K1, and K2 are defined as they were above.

105
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,660
The payoff from this strategy will

106
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,170
look very similar to the payoff from the long put butterfly

107
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,360
spread, but instead, it's flipped

108
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,820
about the horizontal axis in the figure we just saw.

109
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,360
So in particular, this dark, black line,

110
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,480
instead of peaking at the strike price, K1,

111
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,090
will have a decline at the strike price of K1.

112
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,970


113
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,710
This strategy is referred to as a "short put butterfly spread,"

114
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,710
and it's going to realize its maximum payoff when

115
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,600
the price of the underlying stock

116
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,780
is either above the upper strike price

117
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,730
or below the lower strike price at the maturity date.

118
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,160
In other words, entering into a short put butterfly spread

119
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,640
is a good idea when you expect the volatility of the stock

120
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,420
price to increase, implying a higher likelihood

121
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,970
that the stock price moves beyond the range of strike

122
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,650
prices of the butterfly.

123
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,770
In other words, a short put butterfly spread

124
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,080
is a bet on higher volatility of the stock price.
