PROFESSOR: Now that we've reviewed risk-neutral pricing,

1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,970
let's close the recitation by reviewing

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,450
dynamic replication or the replicating portfolio approach.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,780
As discussed by Professor Lucas in the week 4 lecture,

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,870
the replicating portfolio approach to pricing an option

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,060
should imply the exact same price

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,040
as the risk-neutral pricing approach that we just reviewed.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,020
In a multi-period setting, however,

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,330
constructing the replicating portfolio

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,650
may be a cumbersome procedure.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,140
As an example, consider a stock price

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,440
that evolves according to the binomial tree below.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,520
At time T equals 0, the stock price is $50.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,070
At time T equals 1, the stock price

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,300
is $70 in the up node and $35 in the down node.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,910
And now we add a third period, time T

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,710
equals 2, where the stock price is $100 in the up-up node,

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,790
50 in either the up-down or the down-up node,

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,190
or 25 in the down-down node.

19
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,830
Using the replicating portfolio approach,

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,770
we can price a call option with maturity,

21
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:15,230
T equals 2 and strike price, K equals $50 in five steps.

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,680
In the first step, determine the payoffs

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,650
from the call option at each node of the tree at t

24
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,610
equals 2, that is, working backwards.

25
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:31,220
Well, let C2,uu be the payoff of the call option in the up-up

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:37,100
node at time T equals 2, C2,ud which is the same as C2,du be

27
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,400
the payoffs in the up-down and down-up nodes,

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,980
and C2,dd be the payoff in the down-down node.

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,010
Since the strike price of the call option is $50,

30
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,210
the payoff of the call option in the up-up node is $50.

31
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,170
In the up-down or down-up node, it's $0.

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,460
And similarly, in the down-down node, it's also $0.

33
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,940
In step 2, we can find the position delta

34
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,630
to invest in stocks in our replicating portfolio

35
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,964
at each node of the tree at T equals 1.

36
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:19,680
At T equals 1, the delta in the up node, which is Delta 1,u,

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,820
is equal to the difference between the payoff of the call

38
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,660
option in the up-up node and the payoff of the call option

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,460
in the up-down node, divided by the price of the stock at time

40
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,720
T equals 2 in the up-up node and the price of the stock at time

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,310
T equals 2 in the up-down node, which is equal to 50 minus 0

42
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,170
divided by 100 minus 50, which is equal to 1 in the up node.

43
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,390
So we invest all of our replicating portfolio in stocks

44
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,360
at time T equals 1 in the up node.

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,300
A similar calculation for delta at time T

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,840
equals 1 in the down node shows that our delta is

47
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,940
equal to 0 in the down node.

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,350
So we invest none of our portfolio in stocks

49
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,200
in the down node at time T equals 1.

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,750
In step 3, we can find the amount

51
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,050
of risk-free bonds in our replicating portfolio

52
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,560
at each node of the tree at time T equals 1.

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,840
We'll recall from the week 4 lecture notes

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,290
that once we know the deltas at time T equals 1 in both the

55
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,380
up node and the down node, it's very easy

56
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,360
to compute the amount of risk-free bonds

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,920
that we invest in.

58
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,670
For example, in the up node at time T equals 1,

59
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,060
the number of risk-free bonds that we purchase is

60
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,820
equal to the negative of the exponential

61
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,900
of the negative risk-free rate times the sum of the negative

62
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,710
of the value of the call option at time

63
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,610
T equals 2 in the up-up node plus the delta at time T

64
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,030
equals 1 in the up node times the stock price at time T

65
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,830
equals 2 in the up-up node.

66
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,890
This is like the dollar size of our position

67
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,700
in the stock at time T equals 1 in the up node, which, overall,

68
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,490
equals negative 44.7917 in the up node at time T equals 1.

69
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,380
That is a short position of 44.7917 units

70
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,970
in the risk-free bond at time T equals 1 in the up node,

71
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,040
and a similar calculation shows that we

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,170
invest nothing in risk-free bonds in the down node at time

73
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,980
T equals 1.

74
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,090
In step 4, we can find the value of a replicating portfolio

75
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,130
at each node of the tree at time T

76
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,580
equals 1, which, by no-arbitrage, is also

77
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,610
the value of the call option at each node.

78
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,770
Well, the value of the replicating portfolio

79
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,690
slash call option at time T equals

80
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,540
1, for instance for the up node, is just

81
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,890
the sum of the value of our stock portfolio at time

82
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,830
T equals 1 plus the value of our bond portfolio at time

83
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,550
T equals 1 in the up node, which is equal to 25.2083.

84
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,860
A similar calculation for the down node

85
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,400
shows that the value of the replicating portfolio or call

86
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,780
option in the down node at time T equals 1 is equal to $0.

87
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,460
There were certainly a lot of equations

88
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,890
to keep track of in the first four steps.

89
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,070
So an easy way of summarizing what we've done so far

90
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,890
is to replicate the binomial tree.

91
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,200
But now, in addition to the value

92
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,600
of the stock at each node, I've also

93
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,410
included the delta of the replicating portfolio

94
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,410
at each node, the value of the investment

95
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,290
in the risk-free bonds at each node,

96
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,440
and, finally, the value of the call option or replicating

97
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,240
portfolio at each node at both T equals 1 and T equals 2.

98
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,590
In our fifth and final step, we simply repeat steps 2

99
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,360
through 4 for the T equals 0 node.

100
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
In other words, we find the delta

101
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,930
of our replicating portfolio for the T equals 0 node,

102
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,690
we find our investment in risk-free bonds

103
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,380
of our replicating portfolio for the T equals 0 node,

104
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,830
and we find the value of our replicating portfolio for the T

105
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,120
equals 0 node, equivalently, the value of our call option,

106
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,780
by using the fact that the value of the call option at time T

107
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:35,900
equals 1 in the up node is equal to 25.2083 and is equal to 0

108
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,680
in the down node at time T equals 1.

109
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,280
The binomial tree below summarizes step 5.

110
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,080
In particular, the delta at time T equals 0 is equal to 0.7202.

111
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,907
The investment in risk-free bonds at time T

112
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:58,610
equals 0 is equal to negative 22.5824.

113
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,340
That is, we short 22.5824 of risk-free bonds

114
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,810
in a replicating portfolio.

115
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,065
And the value of a replicating portfolio at time T

116
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:12,680
equals 0, equivalently, the value of our call option,

117
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,320
is equal to 13.4294.

118
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,140
Well, that wraps up week 4 recitation.

119
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,540
Thank you everyone for coming, and I look forward

120
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,230
to seeing all of you next week.
