00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,030
PROFESSOR: Hello everyone, and welcome to the fourth

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,010
recitation of 15.435x.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,320
In this recitation, we're going to be mixing things

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,010
up a little bit.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,410
As opposed to reviewing practice problems,

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,190
we'll be reviewing three topics that Professor Lucas presented

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,750
in the Week 4 lecture.

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,020
In the first topic, we'll be reviewing the mechanics of bull

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,170
spreads and butterfly spreads.

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,270
In the second topic, we'll see how

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,670
we can use risk-neutral pricing to find

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,550
the price of a put option in a forward contract.

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,680
And in the third concept, we'll see

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,780
how we can use the replicating portfolio

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,770
approach to price a call option in the multi-period binomial

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,320
model.
