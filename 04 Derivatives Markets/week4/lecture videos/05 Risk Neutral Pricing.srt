00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,950
INSTRUCTOR: Let's turn to the important topic

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,240
of risk-neutral pricing.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,340
If you look back to the general approach

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,290
for finding a replicating portfolio

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,500
to price an option on slide 32, you'll

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,570
see that none of the formulas involve

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,440
the true probability, q, of the stock price going up at time 1

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,040
on the binomial tree.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,960
The natural question is whether this

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,260
means that those actual probabilities really

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,320
don't affect option prices.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,210
The answer is yes and no.

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,600
Mechanically, we don't need the probabilities

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,790
because we valued options by matching

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,360
the payoffs of the options and the replicating portfolios

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,060
in each of the possible future states of the world

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,580
individually, using the information

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,745
in the binomial tree about stock prices and the risk free rate.

19
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:57,160


20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,270
However, the physical probability, q

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,069
determines future stock prices and their volatility.

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,470
Given a risk adjusted discount rate for the stock,

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,340
it also determines the current stock price.

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,440
Hence, the current stock price reflects

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,910
the probability distribution of future stock prices.

26
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,870
Now since option values depend on the current stock price, S0,

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,860
the probability does in fact influence the option value

28
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,170
but it only does so indirectly.

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:38,710


30
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,810
The fact that there's no direct dependence

31
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,840
on the physical probability, q is the basis

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,040
for being able to use the trick of risk-neutral pricing

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,400
as an alternative to finding the replicating portfolio.

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,150


35
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,210
Risk-neutral pricing is a mathematical alternative

36
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,690
to a replicating portfolio approach to pricing options

37
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,900
that's often simpler to work with.

38
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,320
Because the true or physical probability, q,

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,280
of an up step in the tree is not used in the pricing formulas

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,250
based on portfolio replication, we're

41
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,270
free to replace that probability with the so-called risk-neutral

42
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,120
probability.

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,850
The risk-neutral probability is chosen

44
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,330
to be as if we live in a risk-neutral world

45
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,410
where all cash flows are discounted at a risk-free rate,

46
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,400
including those for risky stocks and derivative securities

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,800
like options and futures.

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,750
That is, we can find the risk-neutral neutral

49
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,860
probability, which we'll call q*,

50
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,720
by solving for it in a formula that equates the stock price

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,590
with the present value of the time 1 cash flows on the stock,

52
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,230
discounted at the risk free rate.

53
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,200
For instance, doing this in our last example

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,920
would replace the true discount rate of 19%

55
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,540
with the risk free rate of 11%.

56
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,060


57
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,000
There still is actually a risk adjustment,

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,210
but it's accomplished through the distorted probability

59
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:19,000
weights by using q* instead of q.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,310
Here's the present value calculation.

61
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:29,920
And now we can rearrange that formula and solve for q*

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,370
in terms of the stock prices on all of the nodes

63
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,145
of our binomial tree and the risk-free rate.

64
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:39,530


65
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,540
We can represent the time 0 stock price as the expectation

66
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,470
of the discounted future payoffs on the stock,

67
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,770
but under the risk-neutral expectation operator,

68
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,810
E* that uses risk-neutral probabilities in place

69
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,875
of the physical ones.

70
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,410


71
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,060
The advantage of this approach is

72
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,180
that we can now price any derivative security on a stock

73
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,690
by calculating the derivative's expected payoff

74
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,240
using risk-neutral probabilities in place

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,700
of physical probabilities, and discounting

76
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,380
at the risk free rate.

77
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,500
That idea is summarized by formula one here.

78
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,620
Going back to our previous example where the stock price

79
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,240
is 50 at time 0, and either 70 or 35 in one period,

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,000
and with the risk free rate of 11%,

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,040
we can solve for q* using the formula we derived for it.

82
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,740


83
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,300
We know that the call option has a payoff of 20 on the up node

84
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,520
and is worth 0 on the down node.

85
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,980
We can now find its price by finding

86
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,210
the risk-neutral expectation of the option's value at time 1,

87
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,510
and discounting it back at the risk free rate to time 0.

88
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,140


89
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,360
The result is exactly the same as what

90
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,840
we calculated with the replicating portfolio approach.

91
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,610
The call is worth 10.6547.

92
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,860
Now if you ever find a small difference

93
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,100
when you compare your answers between the two approaches,

94
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,060
it will be due to rounding error in your calculations,

95
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,970
not any true difference in the answers.

96
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,130
Mathematically, the two approaches

97
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,500
are completely equivalent.

98
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,540
Here's a recipe that summarizes what

99
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,330
we've learned about risk neutral pricing of European style

100
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,820
derivatives on a binomial tree.

101
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,700
We start by assuming counter factually

102
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,280
that prices are determined by discounting

103
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,240
at a risk-free rate.

104
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,500
This is often described as assuming a fictional world

105
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,630
where people are risk-neutral Then

106
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,940
based on the model of the evolution of stock

107
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,370
prices and the risk free rate, we

108
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,990
infer the risk-neutral probabilities.

109
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,880
We can then use these probabilities

110
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,430
to compute the price of any derivative security

111
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,540
based on taking the risk-neutral expectation of the payoffs,

112
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,910
and discounting at the risk-free rate.

113
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,620
This recipe is easily extended to the multi-step trees that

114
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,340
will start to look at next, and to other approaches to pricing,

115
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,590
including Monte Carlo methods, that we'll

116
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,280
be touching on in a few weeks.

117
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,484
