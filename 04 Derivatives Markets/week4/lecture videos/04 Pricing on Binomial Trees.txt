1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,020
PROFESSOR: Like forward contracts,

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,120
options can be priced using no-arbitrage logic.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,790
One of the greatest achievements of modern finance

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,550
was to recognize this fact and use

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,520
it to develop models that are both practical

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,920
and mathematically elegant.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,560
We'll start by learning a relatively simple,

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,890
but powerful and flexible, approach, which is to price

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,290
options using binomial trees.

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,570
We will also use the binomial approach

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,770
to explain risk-neutral pricing and illustrate its application.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,580


13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,350
A major theme running through all

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,870
of the courses in the MicroMasters program

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,070
is that the value of any asset is the net present value

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,070
of its future cash flows, discounted

17
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,310
at an appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate.

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,010
That principle also holds for valuing

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,340
options and other derivative securities.

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,430
However, the reason we don't directly value options

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,489
by discounting their expected future cash flows

22
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,920
is because of the difficulty of identifying

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,270
the right cost of capital.

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,580
In fact, there's no single discount rate that could work.

25
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,280
That's because an option is equivalent

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,790
to a leveraged position in the underlying asset, where

27
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,540
the leverage changes over time with changes in the underlying

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,040
asset price.

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,780
As the implicit leverage changes,

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,500
so does the cost of capital.

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,560
A no-arbitrage approach eliminates the need

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,410
to identify any cost of capital.

33
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,400
Instead, risk adjustment is incorporated via the price

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,530
of the risky asset.

35
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,200
This idea is most easily understood using

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,840
a binomial pricing approach.

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,380
Binomial trees incorporate the six main factors affecting

38
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,750
the price of a stock option.

39
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,120
First, the current stock price, S0, second, the strike price,

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,810
K, third, the time to expiration,

41
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,770
T, fourth, the volatility of the stock price,

42
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:15,320
sigma, fifth, the risk-free free interest rate, r, sixth,

43
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,830
any expected dividends.

44
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,020
These same factors are the inputs

45
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,330
that go into the Black-Scholes-Merton model

46
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,785
that we'll look at next week.

47
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:27,540


48
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,090
We'll start with one-step trees, and then

49
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,980
extend the idea later to a tree with many steps.

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,710
Let's say that today is T equals 0

51
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,020
and you're evaluating a stock.

52
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,020
You approximate the distribution of the stock's price

53
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,980
at time 1 with a two point distribution.

54
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,170
You say that the stock price will

55
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,550
be $70 with a probability, q, of 0.7.

56
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,240
And it will be $35 with a probability of 1

57
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,770
minus q of 0.3.

58
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,320
Also imagine that you believe that the market expects

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,600
a return of 19% on a simple interest basis.

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,530
In that case, the stock price today

61
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,260
can be calculated as the expected value of the stock

62
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,560
at time 1 discounted at that risk-adjusted rate.

63
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,370
Taking the probabilities and the values that we just looked at,

64
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,700
we have a 70% chance that the stock

65
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,710
will be at $70, a 30% chance that it will be at $35.

66
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,700
That's the expected price at time 1.

67
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,250
We discount at 19%.

68
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:49,100
And we get a stock price today of $50.

69
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,700
We can take this information and represent it

70
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,370
in a binomial tree.

71
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:02,410
At time 0, we have a stock price of $50, and at time 1,

72
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,100
the stock price, in the up state,

73
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,560
will be $70 and a time 1 the stock price, in the down state,

74
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,890
will be $35.

75
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,000


76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,329
Given this model description, the expected return

77
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,250
of the variance of the return can

78
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,650
be computed using the formulas for each,

79
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,510
as shown on the slide.

80
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,360
Plugging in our values, the expected gross return

81
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,390
on the stock is 1.19.

82
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,510
Its variance is 0.1029.

83
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:41,310
And its standard deviation is 0.3207.

84
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,070
We took the assumptions about the probabilities

85
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,130
and the time 1 stock values as given

86
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,020
but you should think of the model

87
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,750
as having been calibrated beforehand

88
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,810
to match the expected return and volatility,

89
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,870
based on historical data on the stock return

90
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,180
and a model of returns like the CAPM or the APT.

91
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,530
Intuitively, it should be clear that a higher volatility will

92
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,940
be captured by assuming more distance between the time 1

93
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,830
up and down nodes.

94
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,620
We'll return to how trees are actually calibrated

95
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,450
with data in the next class.

96
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,260


97
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,530
This slide starts with a question.

98
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,840
Can an option on the stock be valued

99
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,090
using the NPV rule directly?

100
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,830
The answer is no, because as I mentioned a little while ago,

101
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,040
we don't know how to find the right cost of capital

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,620
for discounting the payoffs on the option.

103
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,500
However, we can price a call option

104
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,270
on the stock using the idea of a replicating portfolio.

105
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,270
Consider a call option on this stock that matures at time 1

106
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,270
and that has a strike price of $50.

107
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,890
We can compute its payoffs a time 1 at each node.

108
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,310
On the up node, the option will be exercised

109
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,340
and the payoff will be the difference between the stock

110
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,860
price of $70 and the strike price

111
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,290
of $50, so a payoff of $20.

112
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,530


113
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,840
On the down node, the stock price

114
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,560
is less than the strike price and the option

115
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,260
expires worthless.

116
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,930
We can put this information on our binomial tree.

117
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,100
We had the tree where the stock price is currently $50.

118
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,590
We want to know the value of the call option, which

119
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,135
we'll call C of 0.

120
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:44,030


121
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:52,150
The stock goes up to $70 at the up node at time 1.

122
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,240
And we just calculated that the value

123
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:02,100
of the option at time 1 on the up node is equal to 20.

124
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,110
On the down node, the stock price is $35.

125
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:14,400
And the call option at time 1 on the down node is worth nothing.

126
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
We'll now see what it means to say we are pricing

127
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,180
with a replicating portfolio.

128
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,630
Let's add one additional piece of information, too,

129
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,180
that we'll need, which is that the risk-free rate is

130
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,710
11% on a continuously compounded basis.

131
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,780
Consider a portfolio that has the stock and risk-free

132
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,170
zero coupon bonds.

133
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,680
Our position in the stock, which we'll call delta,

134
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,290
will consist of 0.5714 shares of the stock, which

135
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,800
will give dollar value of our stock holdings of delta times

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,890
the current stock price, which gives us $28.57 in the stock.

137
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,710
Our position in the zero coupon bond

138
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,090
will be worth minus $17.9167.

139
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,140
And recall that this negative bond price position means

140
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,290
you're short in the bonds.

141
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,580
The value of the portfolio today,

142
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,600
then, is the sum of the stock and bond positions.

143
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:23,580
So the $28.57 minus the $17.91 gives us the portfolio

144
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:34,080
that today is worth $10.6547.

145
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,770
We can find value of the portfolio at time 1

146
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,580
based on the time 1 value of each position in the tree.

147
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,940
A little algebra will show us that in the up node,

148
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,310
the value of the portfolio will be $20

149
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,520
and the down node will be $0.

150
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,480
For example, if we look at the up node,

151
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,030
the stock will be worth the delta shares times the stock

152
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:06,730
price on the up node, which is 0.5714 --

153
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,990
we fixed delta --

154
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,960
and $70 is the new stock price.

155
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,730
And then the bond position will be the original investment

156
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,260
with interest.

157
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,140
It's a short position so it's negative,

158
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,140
and the net value is $20.

159
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,310
What's important here is that these payoffs

160
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,830
are identical to the payoffs that we

161
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,750
computed on the call option.

162
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,310
So now, we can apply the no-arbitrage idea.

163
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,000
That if we have two portfolios with identical payoffs

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,340
in every state of the world, they

165
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,670
have to have the same value today.

166
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,170
That allows us to conclude that the value of the call option

167
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,420
is the same as the value of this replicating portfolio, which

168
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,960
we calculated to be $10.6547.

169
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,940
I'm sure you're wondering, how did

170
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,160
we know how to choose the delta and bond

171
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,530
position in the last example to find

172
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,870
this replicating portfolio?

173
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,390
Well, it was calculated using the logic

174
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,610
that we have two free variables, delta,

175
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,420
and B0, that are tied down by two linear equations

176
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,650
in those variables.

177
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,690
Those equations say that the payoff

178
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,840
on the replicating portfolio on each node

179
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,740
has to equal the value of the call option on that node.

180
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,780
Here's the two equations --

181
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,830
first for the up node, second for the down node.

182
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,680


183
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,950
We can rearrange each of these two equations

184
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:50,200
to solve for the future value of B0

185
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,040
in terms of the difference between the call

186
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,890
option on the node and delta times

187
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,150
the stock price on that node.

188
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:09,310
Well, now we have this equality, which is an equation in delta.

189
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:17,530
And we can then solve for delta as the ratio of the difference

190
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,950
of the call option in the up node and the call option

191
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,780
in the down node divided by the difference in the stock prices

192
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,100
between the up and down node.

193
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,980


194
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,830
The idea that the stock option delta represents

195
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,150
the sensitivity of option prices to changes in the stock price

196
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,050
is one we will keep on coming back to.

197
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,690
Once we know delta, we can find B0

198
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,080
using either of the original linear equations.

199
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,030
Here, we're using the one with the up node.

200
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,030


201
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,280
Know that we could have started with a put option instead.

202
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,680
And the same general approach would have applied.

203
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,380


204
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,380
Now we can verify that the general approach for finding

205
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,190
delta and B0 works for the example we just looked at.

206
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,460
Here again is the binomial tree, and stock prices,

207
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,995
and the corresponding call option payoffs.

208
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:19,870


209
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,520
Based on this information, and the risk free rate of 11%,

210
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,520
we can confirm that the replicating portfolio

211
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:38,210
has a delta of 0.5714.

212
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,470
We can also confirm that the portfolio has a short position

213
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:49,910
in bonds of $17.9167.

214
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,860
We can draw another important conclusion

215
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,500
from this example, which is that a stock

216
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,260
option is like a levered position in the underlying

217
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,370
stock.

218
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,640
There's leverage, because B0 is negative,

219
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,310
which represents borrowing.

220
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,850
And there's a long position in the underlying stock,

221
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,640
because delta is positive.

222
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,600
So it's as if you've borrowed to invest

223
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,860
in a stock, which is a leveraged position in the stock.

224
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,960
The amount of leverage in the position

225
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,550
will change over time as the stock price changes.

226
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,170
To sum up, in order to price any derivative of a stock

227
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:41,080
on a one-step binomial tree that has a payoff of V1u on the up

228
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,890
node, and the V1d on the down node,

229
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,930
these are the steps you'll follow.

230
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,200
First, calculate the amount of shares, delta,

231
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,240
to invest in stocks.

232
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,600
Second, calculate the amount, B0,

233
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,700
to invest in risk-free bonds.

234
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,540
And third, compute the value of the security

235
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,910
based on the value of that replicating portfolio.

236
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,000
