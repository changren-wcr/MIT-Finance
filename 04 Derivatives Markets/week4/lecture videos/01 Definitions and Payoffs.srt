1
00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:02,240
PROFESSOR: You learned the basics of options

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,370
and other parts of the MicroMasters Program,

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,070
but I want to quickly review them here.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,130
Options confer upon their holder the right but not

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,090
the obligation to buy or sell a pre-specified security

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,120
or commodity at a predetermined price, which is also

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,310
called the strike price.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,250
A call option gives the right to buy.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,230
A put option gives the right to sell.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,970
Using the option is called exercising the option.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,820
Options have fixed maturity dates which

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,630
are called expiration dates.

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,300
A European-style style option can only

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,590
be exercised on the expiration date of the contract.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,760
An American option can be exercised any time up

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,580
and until its expiration.

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,040
I remember that difference with the mnemonic

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,410
that the E in European stands for End, and the A in American

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,840
stands for Any time.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,650
The seller of an option is said to write the option.

21
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,440
The option writer receives the option premium,

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,100
which is the price paid for the option.

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,590
The premium is paid up front.

24
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,040
The right to buy or sell at a predetermined price

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,820
is valuable, and options always have a positive value

26
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,820
to the holder and a cost to the writer.

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,100
The premium is compensation for that cost.

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,980
Although American options are more common in practice

29
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,710
than European options, it's much easier

30
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,800
to analyze and price European options.

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,460
European options pricing formulas also often work

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,930
for American options.

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,770
Hence, we'll focus on European options to build intuition

34
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,740
and to develop basic pricing formulas.

35
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,480
Towards the end of this lecture, we'll

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,510
also consider an example of the modifications

37
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,650
we'll need to analyze the price of American options.

38
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,870
Options on the stocks of many large firms

39
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,910
are listed on exchanges.

40
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,520
If you're interested in taking a look at data that's currently

41
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,800
available on a particular firm, I

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,520
suggest you go to the website of the Chicago Board Options

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,980
Exchange, or CBOE, and take a look.

44
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,160
But here, we have an example of the options

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,810
available on a particular day on Apple stock.

46
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:35,720
The most recent stock trade that day was recorded to be $377.37.

47
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,270
As is typical in this market, there's

48
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:46,400
put and call options, which are available with a variety

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,500
of strike prices on both sides of the current stock price

50
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,690
and with a variety of maturities.

51
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:01,540
For instance, the Apple October $380 call, which is right here,

52
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,200
has a strike price of $380.

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,530
It expires in 79 days.

54
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,520
The options contract can be purchased for $24.20,

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,780
the ask price.

56
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,750
It can be sold for the bid price of $23.75.

57
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,210
Just so you get an idea of what is available

58
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,260
and where, this slide lists the major exchanges where options

59
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,200
are actively traded and the broad categories

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,460
of exchange-traded options contracts.

61
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,940
As we saw for futures, traded options

62
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,480
offer the protection of central clearing, which minimizes

63
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,060
default or counterparty risk.

64
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,190
The exchange requires margin to be

65
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,130
posted to ensure performance.

66
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,890
Unlike futures, where the margin requirements

67
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,800
are symmetric for the long and short sides of the contract

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,350
because the risks are also symmetric,

69
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,130
in the options market, where the risk is asymmetric,

70
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,210
it's the seller who has to pose a large enough margin

71
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,210
to ensure that the seller's obligation can be met.

72
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,860


73
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,670
To determine the payoffs on a European call option,

74
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,490
we consider the optimal actions of the call option

75
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,959
buyer at the expiration date, capital T.

76
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,280
If the stock price on that date, s sub T,

77
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,470
is less than the strike price, then the option

78
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,520
should never be exercised.

79
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,460
If the option buyer wants to buy the stock,

80
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,040
they can do that more cheaply by buying the stock

81
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,820
in the open market rather than by paying the strike price

82
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,185
and exercising the option.

83
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:44,840


84
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,530
If the stock price is greater than the strike price,

85
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,710
it's optimal to exercise the option.

86
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,740
That's because by exercising the option

87
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,430
and paying k for a stock that's currently worth more than

88
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,050
that, they realize a payoff of the price of the stock

89
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,550
minus the strike price.

90
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,450


91
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,940
That's true whether or not the option buyer

92
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,180
wants to keep the stock in their portfolio,

93
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,400
since if they don't want to keep the stock,

94
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,500
they can immediately sell it after the exercise the option.

95
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,690
The equation on the bottom of the slide

96
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,630
summarizes this logic, stating that the payoff

97
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,210
on a long position in a call option

98
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,300
is the maximum of the difference at the expiration

99
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,660
date between the stock price and the strike price and 0.

100
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,380
The payout for a call option can be plotted on a payoff diagram.

101
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,990
Remember that a payoff diagram shows the profit

102
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,960
from a cash or derivatives position as a function

103
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,000
of the underlying asset.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,040
In the example here, the underlying

105
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,560
is one share of stock, and the option

106
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,220
has a strike price, k, of 100.

107
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,150
The payoff is $0 if the stock price at expiration

108
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,800
is less than $100, and rises 1 for 1 with the stock price

109
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,110
when the stock price exceeds $100.

110
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,090
I also want to remind you that we

111
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,890
can plot the sum of multiple positions on a payoff diagram.

112
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,290
If instead, we were looking at a call

113
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,080
option for two shares of the stock

114
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,770
instead of for just one share, the upward-sloping part

115
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,870
of the line would be twice as steep.

116
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,150
So we get a figure that looks like this.

117
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,170


118
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,740
There's also some terminology you should know.

119
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,420
And out of the money call option is

120
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,360
one where the strike price is greater than the current price

121
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,130
of the underlying.

122
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,740
And in the money call option, it has a strike price

123
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,680
that's less than the current market price of the underlying.

124
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,100
And at the money call, it has a strike price

125
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,560
that equals the current price of the underlying.

126
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,000
We'll use the abbreviations OTM, ITM and ATM

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,590
to describe each of those situations.

128
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,080
As we're all cash or derivative positions,

129
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,510
the payoff on a short position is

130
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,030
the negative of the payoff on the long position.

131
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,700
In terms of payoff diagrams, then, that

132
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,550
flips the payoff over the x-axis.

133
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,130
For a short call option, the payoff

134
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,750
has the characteristic shape shown here.

135
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,670
We can use the same sort of analysis

136
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,760
to infer the payoff on a European put option

137
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,180
by considering the optimal actions of the put option buyer

138
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,450
at the expiration date, capital T.

139
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,440
If the stock price is less than the strike price at T,

140
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,920
then it's optimal to exercise the option.

141
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,470
That's because by exercising the option

142
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,100
and receiving the strike price, k, for a stock that's currently

143
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,090
worth less than k, they realized a positive payoff

144
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,370
equal to k minus the value of the stock.

145
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,290


146
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,540
That's true whether or not the option holder

147
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,180
wants to keep the stock in their portfolio.

148
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,010
If they still do want to hold it,

149
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,740
they can immediately buy the stock in the open market

150
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,350
after delivering it in the options contract,

151
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,230
leaving them with a stock and also with a gain

152
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,540
from the payoff on the options contract.

153
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,480
Now, if the stock price is greater

154
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,600
than the strike price, k, then the option

155
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,460
should not be exercised.

156
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,130
If the option holder wants to sell the stock,

157
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,230
they can get more for it by selling

158
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,669
the stock in the open market than by exercising the option.

159
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,620
The equation at the bottom of the slide

160
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,179
summarizes this logic, stating that the payoff is

161
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:47,780
the maximum of the difference between the strike price

162
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,340
and the stock price and $0.

163
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,530
We can plot the payoff for a long put

164
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,625
position on a payoff diagram to get this characteristic shape.

165
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,260


166
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,330
This example is, again, based on a strike

167
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,320
price of $100 and a put option contract

168
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,865
based on one share of stock.

169
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:14,090


170
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,560
Also, as usual, the payoff diagram for a short position

171
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,510
flips the picture for the long position over the x-axis.

172
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,770
Note that for puts also, the slope parts of the lines

173
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,140
can be made steeper by increasing

174
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,470
the number of contracts or the number of stocks specified

175
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,180
in a single contract.

176
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,090
Focusing on payoffs alone gives an incomplete picture

177
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,070
of the cash flows involved in options

178
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,140
transactions, because it neglects

179
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,060
the upfront premium paid from the buyer

180
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,410
to the writer of the option.

181
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,710
In fact, just looking at the payoff diagram,

182
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,740
it suggests that one would never write

183
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,620
an option because the best outcome would involve a zero

184
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,060
payoff.

185
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,670
And payoff diagrams make an option

186
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,060
look like a free lunch with no possibility of loss

187
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,480
from the perspective of the long side.

188
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,870
Profit diagrams give a more complete picture of the cash

189
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,350
flows involved by subtracting the upfront premium

190
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,050
from the payoffs to the buyers and adding it

191
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,010
to the payoffs of the sellers.

192
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,800
Note that profit diagrams typically

193
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,130
don't adjust for the higher future value of the premiums

194
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,230
because they're paid up front.

195
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,780
That distortion tends to be small

196
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,940
when interest rates are low and for short-dated options.

197
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,520
The graphs here show how taking into account

198
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,370
the premium in a profit diagram causes

199
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,060
those diagrams to differ from the corresponding payoff

200
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,890
diagrams.

201
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,620
It's clear in a profit diagram that there's

202
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,220
no free lunch for option buyers, and that option sellers.

203
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,580
profit when market conditions are such that options

204
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,720
are allowed to expire without exercise.

205
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,110
Despite that seeming advantage of profit diagrams

206
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,690
in providing a more complete picture,

207
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,750
path diagrams are actually more common.

208
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,450
That's because they give a clear idea

209
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,670
of the amounts that will change hands

210
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,400
at the contract expiration.

211
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,590
Knowing the outcomes at that time

212
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,800
is useful in evaluating trading strategies,

213
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,620
and also, it's an essential input

214
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,550
into the pricing of the contracts.

215
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:51,000
