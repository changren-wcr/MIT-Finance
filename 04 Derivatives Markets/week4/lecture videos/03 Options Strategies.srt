INSTRUCTOR: In this segment, we'll

1
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:03,840
take a look at some of the most popular trading strategies

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,910
involving put and call options that you

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,570
can use to manage risk exposures in your own portfolio

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,200
and on behalf of your firm or for your clients.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,750
A simple and effective way to retain the upside risk

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,570
on an individual stock or other security

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,250
and to limit the downside is with a protective put.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,610
The strategy simply involves buying a put option

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,950
on the stock that you want protection for.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,850
The payoff diagram here shows the combination

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,820
of the put option in the stock, so it assumes

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,485
you already are long the stock.

13
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:43,230


14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,455
Here's the payoff on the put option.

15
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:51,520


16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,090
Here's the payoff on the stock.

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,730
And now if you vertically add the payoffs and the put

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,155
in the stock, you get the total payoff, equal to the red line.

19
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:10,840


20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,320
This the strike price on the put option

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,930
provides the floor then on the payoff

22
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,700
on the stock over the horizon T of the option.

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,460
The more protection that you want, the higher

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,580
is strike price you would choose on the put.

25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,980
As you'd expect, a higher strike price

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,950
means paying a higher premium so in choosing

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,650
the level of protection, there's a trade off

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,860
between getting more protection at a higher price and less

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,040
protection at a lower price.

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,050
This is a good place to stop and compare

31
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,210
the protection from a protective put

32
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,510
with that of a short forward or futures contract.

33
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,430
For example, a fund manager may be

34
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,800
concerned about protecting the fall

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,570
in the price of a particular stock, currently priced in S.

36
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,850
It could hedge that risk by selling

37
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,730
shorter forward contract on the stock, which

38
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,820
would have a forward price K, which we know

39
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,759
will be equal to the future value of the current spot

40
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,940
price, S. Doing that entirely eliminates the stock price

41
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,010
risk between now and the expiration

42
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,315
date of the forward contract.

43
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:22,320


44
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,660
The firm eliminates the downside but it also loses the upside.

45
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,540
It costs nothing to enter into this position upfront.

46
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,260
Alternatively, the fund manager could buy a put option

47
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,910
with a strike price of K. As we just discussed,

48
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,730
that would guarantee a minimum payoff of K

49
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,710
and leave the firm with the upside

50
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,930
if the stock is worth more than that.

51
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,710
That's a better outcome but it comes with an upfront cost

52
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,630
of the option premium.

53
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,720
You can think of the second option as equivalent

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,150
to an insurance contract, where you

55
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,750
pay a premium to be protected against losses

56
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,840
but you always keep the gains.

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,560
Relatedly, put options are the basis

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,230
for all strategies that are marketed

59
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,630
as portfolio insurance.

60
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,700
There's no right answer to the question of which

61
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,800
of these strategies is better.

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,080
The strategy of using a forward contract

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,350
will be preferred if the goal is to eliminate all risk.

64
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,660
Using a put option is better if you're

65
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,210
willing to pay the premium for the benefit of keeping

66
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,620
the upside.

67
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,220
Another popular strategy is called a covered call.

68
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,950
This strategy involves writing a call option that

69
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,240
puts a cap on price appreciation for a stock or stock index

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,780
that you already own.

71
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:55,030
You're long the stock and short the call.

72
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,425
And the sum of the two positions is, again, the red line.

73
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:05,220


74
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,950
Why would anyone want to limit the upside pay off

75
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,790
on their portfolio?

76
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,030
Well, of course, no one wants to limit their upside

77
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,690
but what attracts investors to covered calls

78
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,510
is the income from writing the call options.

79
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,930
If you think that the price appreciation is likely to be

80
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,160
slower in the future --

81
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,270
for instance, you think returns on the S&P 500 would be more

82
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,970
modest than most investors expect they will be --

83
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,810
you may prefer to give up the upside in exchange

84
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,240
for the certain option premium.

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,310
And even more pessimistic strategy

86
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,470
is called a bear spread.

87
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,950
A bear spread is a position that, like a put option,

88
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,000
benefits the long side when the stock price falls.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Unlike a put option, the potential gain

90
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,810
is capped at a fixed value.

91
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,410
As for a covered call, the reason to cap the gain

92
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,630
is to reduce the net cost of taking

93
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,375
the position with the premium income from the short side.

94
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,200


95
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,340
Setting up a bear spread involves selling a put option

96
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:20,270
with a strike price of K1 and, at the same time,

97
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,790
taking a long position in a second

98
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,635
put option with a strike price of K2.

99
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:33,006


100
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:36,150
The sum of the long and short put options

101
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,025
gives the red payoff line.

102
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:46,220


103
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,740
The specific example here centers it

104
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,950
at the current stock price of $100

105
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:58,650
and chooses K1 equal to 80 and K2 to equal to 120.

106
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,380
Since your long one option and short another,

107
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,060
you might wonder if this position

108
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,180
costs money or makes money.

109
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,610
The answer is that it has to cost money

110
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,780
because for all possible future realizations of the stock

111
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,670
price, the payoff is positive or 0.

112
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,910
The other indication that this position must cost money

113
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,540
is that, all else equal, a put option with a higher strike

114
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,780
price will be worth more than a put option that's

115
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,000
otherwise similar but with a lower strike price.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,670
If, instead, you wanted to make an optimistic bet

117
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,200
about a stock's prospects, you could enter into a bull spread.

118
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,270
A bull spread has a positive payoff

119
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,360
when the underlying stock price exceeds some value,

120
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,830
and that payoff is capped.

121
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,460


122
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,100
As with the bear spread, the reason for the cap

123
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,770
is to reduce the net cost of getting the desired.

124
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,780
Risk exposure this strategy involves a long position

125
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:08,830
in a call option with a strike price, K1 and a short position

126
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,220
in a second call option with a strike price of K2

127
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,450
to greater than K1.

128
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:20,270


129
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,760
The sum of the two call options creates

130
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,580
the payoff shown here in red.

131
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,030


132
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,740
As with the other positions we've

133
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,440
looked at with only positive payoffs,

134
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,180
remember that entering this position

135
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,010
comes at a cost, which is the difference

136
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,070
between the premiums on the long and short call options.

137
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,920
In the recitation, JR will show you

138
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,590
how to set up the same position using

139
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,590
put options and a risk-free bond and the idea

140
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,500
of put-call parity.

141
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,930
A butterfly spread has a positive payoff

142
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,230
over some range of time T stock price realizations.

143
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,190
Its tent-shaped payoff is like the wings of a butterfly,

144
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,630
and that's how it got its name.

145
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,320


146
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,320
That's what the payoff looks like.

147
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,980
Creating a butterfly spread involves four call options

148
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,920
with three different strike prices and a combination

149
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,010
of long and short positions.

150
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:27,355
First, there's going to be a long call with strike price K0.

151
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:30,190


152
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:37,850
Next, there's two short calls with a strike price of K1,

153
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,260
where K1 centers your position.

154
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:48,100
You can think of each short call option as looking like this.

155
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,800


156
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,790
So we have two of these short call options.

157
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,890
And then, when we add them together,

158
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,720
we get the sum of the two short calls.

159
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,990
Also, you can think of these short calls

160
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,990
as flattening out the original long call position we had,

161
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,820
starting at K1.

162
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,330
So the first of those short calls

163
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,130
takes us from an upward sloping line to a flat line

164
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,290
and the second short call brings us to a downward slope

165
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,570
on the sum of the positions.

166
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,690
Then, finally, we're going to take

167
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,725
another long position in a call with a strike price of K2.

168
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:39,940


169
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,380
And that last position then is going

170
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,970
to flatten out the downward slope that would have continued

171
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,730
if we didn't add it to this, and now we

172
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,145
have another flat segment.

173
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:59,050


174
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,240
Clearly, this butterfly spread allows

175
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,540
you to make a very precise bet about where the stock price

176
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,730
will be on the expiration date.

177
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,220
What's great about these butterfly spreads is

178
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,520
that you can use them to create just about any payoff pattern

179
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,870
you can think of.

180
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,540
And you can have a larger or smaller position

181
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,080
by scaling things up or down.

182
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,600
Next, let's look at a straddle.

183
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,300
A straddle centered at the current stock price

184
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,910
is a bet on high-priced volatility.

185
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,700
As you can see, the gain increases

186
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,860
the further the stock price moves away

187
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,560
from its current value.

188
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,460
A straddle is created quite simply with a long put

189
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,310
and a long call, both with a strike

190
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,440
price equal to the current stock price.

191
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,790
Notice that on this slide, I'm showing a profit diagram

192
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,700
instead of a payoff diagram.

193
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,360
The profit for each option is the payoff shifted down

194
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,250
by the premium paid.

195
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,350
We can add the profits vertically,

196
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,960
just as we do on payoff diagrams,

197
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,800
to get the red line, which is the net profit.

198
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,230
The profit diagram makes it clear

199
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,860
that unless the volatility is sufficiently high,

200
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,240
the profit will turn out to be negative.

201
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,860
You probably can also see there's

202
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,500
a slight asymmetry between the premium

203
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,170
as it's drawn for the put and call options

204
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,210
with the same strike price.

205
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,290
In general, the premium for the call will be higher.

206
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,850
And that's something you can also

207
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,620
prove using put-call parity.

208
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,610
The last strategy we'll look at it's called a strangle.

209
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,570
Like a straddle, a strangle is also a bet on high volatility

210
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,440
and consists of one long put and one long call.

211
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,030
What's different is that the strike price, K0 on the put,

212
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,200
is lower than the strike price, K1 on the call.

213
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,400
That creates a larger region where the profit is negative

214
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,460
but the largest possible loss is somewhat smaller.

215
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,970
You'll get some more practice with these various positions

216
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,760
in the recitation and also in some of the homework questions.
