00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,590
PROFESSOR: A classic use of payoff diagrams

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,410
is to provide a simple proof of the famous put-call parity

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,700
relationship.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,660
That relationship says that the value of a portfolio consisting

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,350
of a long put in a short call both with the same strike

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,530
price K is equal to the present value

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,790
of a short forward contract with a forward price K.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,980
It's important to keep in mind that the options

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,560
in forward contracts refer to the same stock

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,560
and the derivative contracts all have the same expiration

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,340
date, T.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,710
The additional notation that you see here

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,920
is that put refers to the price of the put and hence,

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,940
its premium.

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,520
Call is the call price or the call premium

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,800
and are as the usual risk-free rate.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,090
Recall that the value of the short position in an existing

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,900
forward contract with forward price K, by no arbitrage,

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,290
has to be the present value of the difference between K

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,570
at the current forward price for the contract in the market.

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,640
Now to prove that equation must hold,

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,840
we start by establishing that the two sides of the equation

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,990
have the same payoffs for every possible value of the stock

24
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,070
price at time T. We show this graphically,

25
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:23,450
adding together along put and a short call

26
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,810
and seeing that the sum is the same

27
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,330
as a short forward contract.

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,580


29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,010
Next we applied the idea of no-arbitrage

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,960
to observe that if the two positions have

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,900
identical payoffs in every future state of the world,

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,150
they must have identical prices today.

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,550
That observation leads immediately

34
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,610
to the put-call parity equation that's written again

35
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,620
at the bottom of the slide.

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,360
The put-call parity relationship is

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,670
famous because of its practical importance

38
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,500
in a variety of situations.

39
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
It can be used by traders looking

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,400
to profit from pricing inconsistencies

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,710
between the securities involved.

42
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,750
It can also be used to quickly find

43
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,960
the price of a put given the pricing formula for a call

44
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,190
or vice versa.

45
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,430
It also highlights that many positions

46
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,760
can be described either in terms of puts or in terms of calls

47
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,390
that having these multiple ways of looking at things

48
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,970
is very helpful in understanding the risk

49
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,190
characteristics of a position.

50
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,010
For example, we'll use put-call parity

51
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,070
to help understand the risk dynamics of levered firms

52
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,190
and also of risky corporate debt.

53
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,230
You can use a put-call parity equation

54
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,750
like any other algebraic equation,

55
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,060
for example, rearranging it to solve

56
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,490
for the value of a call in terms of the value

57
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,920
of a put at a forward contract.

58
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,800
Or you can solve it for a put in terms of a value

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,990
call in a forward contract.

60
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,860
Negative values denote short positions and positive values

61
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,500
denote long positions.

62
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,720
The first line here rearranges the equation

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,730
to solve for the value of a put.

64
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,160


65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,650
Then using our pricing formula from

66
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,200
before for a forward contract, we

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,550
can substitute out the current forward price f sub 0 t

68
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,050
and replace it with the future value of the current stock

69
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,415
price as zero.

70
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:30,080


71
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,310
The last line then expresses the put call parity relationship

72
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,750
in terms of put, a call, the current stock price

73
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,300
at the present value of the exercise price

74
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,910
K. It's quite common to see this equation in this form.

75
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,250
To give a numerical example, say you

76
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,920
have a stock selling for $100, a risk free rate of 5%

77
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,190
and an at the money call option priced at $10.45.

78
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,700
Then it must be the case that a put option on the stock that

79
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,990
expires in one year and also has a strike price of 100

80
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,460
sells for $5.57 It's a good exercise for you to think

81
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,649
about the trades you'd have to make

82
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:21,880
to realize a risk free profit if instead this put

83
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,500
was priced differently.

84
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,020
Say it was selling for $6.

85
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,990
Think about what portfolio you would buy

86
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,140
and what you would sell in order to realize an arbitrage profit.

87
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,007
