PROFESSOR: The plan for the next few weeks

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,450
is to help you build a solid understanding of options--

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,730
both the models used to price them

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,030
and their role in risk management strategies.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,370
The outline for this week is, first, we'll

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,330
review some basic definitions and go over payoff and profit

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,500
diagrams.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,010
Second, we'll look at a variety of popular trading strategies

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,110
and how they're constructed.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,020
Third, I want you to understand how options

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,190
can be priced by no arbitrage on binomial trees

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,540
and, importantly, the idea of risk neutral probabilities.

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,200
And finally, you'll learn about how binomial trees can be

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,696
used to price American options.

15
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:42,196
