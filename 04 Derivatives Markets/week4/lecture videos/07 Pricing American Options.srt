00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:03,130
INSTRUCTOR: An American option differs

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,650
from an otherwise identical European option

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,080
in that it can be exercised at any time

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,620
on or before its expiration date.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,400
That additional flexibility implies that an American option

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,090
has to be at least as valuable as its European counterpart,

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,060
and it may be more valuable.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,260
American options are very common, as this list shows.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,560
I'll highlight just a few of these items, many of which

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,190
we'll cover in more detail later in the class.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,690
Individual exchange traded stock options are typically American,

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,640
as are some index options such as the one on the S&P 100

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,260
that's traded at the Chicago Board Options Exchange.

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,020
An option to enter into an interest rate swap

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,770
at a preset fixed rate is called a swaption.

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,560
This very popular type of option is

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,600
sold in the over-the-counter market,

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,290
and is generally American style.

19
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,990
Embedded options, as the name suggests,

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,740
are embedded in other contracts.

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,900
These are very common.

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,390
American style embedded options are

23
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,110
found in some but not all callable and puttable bonds,

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,980
in mortgages, and in convertible bonds.

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,010
The term real options refers to options relating

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,430
to physical investment choices, such as the option

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,270
to wait to close down a plant, or to wait before starting

28
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,220
to construct a new building.

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,610
These are often analyzed using options pricing methods

30
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,760
for American style options.

31
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,700
Although American options can be early exercised,

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,980
we know in some instances that they shouldn't be.

33
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,990
Knowing that is helpful because it allows

34
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,600
us to use European options pricing formulas

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,190
like the Black-Scholes-Merton model

36
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,620
for some American options.

37
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,190
One prominent example is an American call

38
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,400
on a stock that won't pay a dividend before the expiration

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,450
date.

40
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:10,000
Such an option is always worth more alive than dead.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,180
The intuition for this is that early exercise

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,370
means we make the payment of the strike price

43
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,550
sooner, which increases its present value, and that's bad.

44
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,790
We also lose the protection from the risk

45
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,620
that the value falls below the strike price.

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,980
In other words, exercising the option

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:34,300
early extinguishes the valuable insurance value of the option.

48
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,680
Well what if the option is in-the-money

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,790
and you don't want to keep the option for any longer?

50
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,800
You still shouldn't exercise it.

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,190
Instead, you should just sell it in the open market.

52
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,470
Now that analysis for an American call

53
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,960
changes for stocks that will pay a dividend

54
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,330
before the expiration of the option.

55
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,610
Now waiting to exercise also has two disadvantages.

56
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,940
If you wait to exercise, you don't get the dividend,

57
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,550
and the stock price is going to drop

58
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,520
by the amount of the dividend, making it less likely

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,240
that the call is going to be in the money in the future.

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,780
Early exercise avoids these disadvantages,

61
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,650
but at the cost of time value and losing the remaining option

62
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,180
value.

63
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,550
Therefore, what the optimal decision

64
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,590
will be depends on the specifics of the situation.

65
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,230
For American put options, whether or not

66
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,470
to early exercise also depends on several factors that

67
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,020
pull in different directions, so that the answer

68
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,080
will differ depending on the specific situation.

69
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,740
The advantage of early exercising

70
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,650
is that we receive the strike price K sooner,

71
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,300
which, because of time value, increases the present value

72
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,390
of the payment.

73
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,150
An offsetting disadvantage is that we

74
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,750
lose the right to any dividends paid after we exercise,

75
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,210
but before expiration.

76
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,180
Furthermore, we destroy the insurance value

77
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,220
of the put option.

78
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,460
That's described on the side as having given up

79
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,760
a stock for K that may have been worth more than K

80
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,360
in the future.

81
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,290
As for the call option on a dividend paying stock,

82
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,440
we'll have to figure out the best strategy involving

83
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,670
whether and when to early exercise at the same time

84
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,730
as we're valuing the option.

85
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,590
To start to see how to incorporate

86
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,720
the strategic decision of whether and when

87
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,660
to exercise into evaluation framework,

88
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,070
consider this example.

89
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,940
It's May 11, and your longest September put option

90
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,580
on the S&P 100 index with a strike price of K equals 740.

91
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:54,010
The S&P 100 on may 11th stands at 689.83.

92
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,040
The option is currently in-the-money by a little more

93
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,840
than 7% of the index value.

94
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,530
Do you exercise immediately or keep the option alive?

95
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,840
The general procedure is going to be

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,590
to compare the value of immediate exercise, which

97
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,280
in this case is 7% of the index value,

98
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,430
with the value of the option if it's kept alive

99
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,650
under the current conditions.

100
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,130
The decision rule then is to exercise

101
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,250
if and only if the payoff from exercising immediately--

102
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,910
the strike price minus the stock index price--

103
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,150
exceeds the discounted value of the future distribution

104
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,890
of payoffs if you wait.

105
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,140
Valuing options on binomial trees

106
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,400
makes it easy to systematically evaluate the optimal exercise

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,540
strategy in this situation.

108
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,270
Here's a detailed example of how to do this.

109
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,940
The binomial tree here is based on a stock

110
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,700
that's currently valued at 100.

111
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,840
Each time step of the tree represents six months,

112
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,140
so the tree covers a total period of one year.

113
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,040
The interest rate is 2% on a continuous basis.

114
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,500
The vertical spacing of the nodes on the tree

115
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,330
has been chosen to match a stock price volatility of 30%.

116
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,330
We'll talk more about how to do this sort of calibration

117
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,200
next week, but for now we'll just take the stock price tree

118
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,060
as given.

119
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,630
Also, we'll take as given the implication of the assumptions

120
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,200
used here to construct the tree that the risk-neutral

121
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,770
probability of an up move on the tree, q*,

122
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,800
is equal to 0.4707 at every single node of the tree.

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,670
The tree was constructed by multiplying each previous stock

124
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:54,340
price by an up multiplier of 1.2363,

125
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,050
and to get the next down node by multiplying the stock

126
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,820
price by 1 over 1.2363.

127
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,630
Now consider a put option with an at-the-money strike

128
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,840
price of 100.

129
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,010
We'll actually start here by pricing the European version

130
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,910
of the option, which doesn't require any strategic decision

131
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,570
about early exercise, but serves as a review of pricing

132
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,040
European options on a two step tree.

133
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,160
As always, we start at the final date,

134
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,310
i equals 2 here, and compute the payoffs at each node.

135
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,950
If the stock price is 152.847, or 100,

136
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,890
the option is out-of or at-the-money

137
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,620
and so is worth nothing.

138
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:52,480
At the bottom node, 100 minus 65.425

139
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,860
equals 34.575, which is the value

140
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,095
of the put option at that node.

141
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:02,110


142
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,600
Now we can use the risk neutral probability, q*, of 0.4707,

143
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,420
and the risk-free rate of 2% to find the discounted value

144
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,530
of the put at each node working backwards pairwise

145
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,880
on the subtrees.

146
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:27,620
That exercise implies a time 0 value of the put of 9.495.

147
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,290
Now let's consider the value of the put option

148
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,230
if it's American, with everything else the same

149
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,659
as just described.

150
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,929
At expiration at i equals 2, the payoffs

151
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,669
are the same as with the European case,

152
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,440
which is 0 on the top and middle nodes,

153
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,390
and 34.575 on the down down node.

154
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,900
Stepping back to i equals 1, we need

155
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,020
to compare the value of waiting with the value

156
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,640
of immediate exercise.

157
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,620
The value of waiting at each node

158
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,570
can be read off of the calculations

159
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,880
we did for the European version of the option

160
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,160
on the last slide.

161
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,040
Turning to the i equals 1 up node,

162
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,690
the stock price of 123 exceeds the strike price,

163
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,390
and the put option is out-of-the-money so we would

164
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,770
never early exercise it.

165
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,290
At the i equals 1 down node, here's

166
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,720
where things get interesting.

167
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,620
If we exercise immediately, we get the strike of 100

168
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,390
minus the stock price of 80.886, for an immediate payoff

169
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,630
of 19.114.

170
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:48,270
If we wait, the value is less at 18.119.

171
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,510
We conclude that it's better to exercise immediately.

172
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,020
Finally, we can go back to time 0,

173
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,600
where the option is at-the-money and so it's

174
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,100
clearly better to wait.

175
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,360
We find the time 0 price to be 10.017

176
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,800
based on knowing that we won't early exercise at the time 1

177
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,640
up node but that we will early exercise at the time 1

178
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,260
down node.

179
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,690
The calculations for i equals zero and i

180
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,970
equals 1 are highlighted on this sub tree for you to look at.

181
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,700
At each node, we compare the value of immediate exercise

182
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,870
with the value of keeping the option alive.

183
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,600
Note the value of keeping an option alive

184
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,200
will depend on what we concluded on any future nodes

185
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,380
about whether or not to early exercise.

186
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,010
By working backwards, we're able to take into account

187
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,220
all of the relevant future strategic decisions

188
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,230
on each node.

189
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,470
Comparing the results, the American option

190
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,580
is worth 10.017, which is more than what

191
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,670
we found for the European version of the option, which

192
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,850
was worth 9.495.

193
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,670
The difference, of course, is because of what

194
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,490
happens at the i equals 1 down node,

195
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,740
where there's an extra benefit from early exercise.

196
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,000
