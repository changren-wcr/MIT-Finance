1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,340
PROFESSOR: Clearly, it's impossible to accurately model

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,500
the future distribution of stock prices

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,280
or derivative payoffs using a two-point distribution

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,350
and we wouldn't expect that model

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,290
to do a good job of pricing derivatives.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,720
Luckily, we can extend the ideas we've

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,390
developed for one-step trees to trees

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,260
with an arbitrarily large number of steps and by doing so,

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,550
capture the distribution of outcomes much more accurately.

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,310
The general idea of how to do pricing

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,420
on a multi-step binomial tree can be most easily understood

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,850
using a two-step tree.

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,480
In the tree here, we've started with the original tree

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,690
from our last example and extended it out

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,320
one more period.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,030
If at time 1, for instance, the stock price

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,180
is at the up node at 70, we're going

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:06,370
to assume that it will be either 100 or 50 the next period.

19
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,950
Starting at the down node at time 1,

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,310
where the stock price equals 35, we'll now assume that at time 2

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,410
it will go up to 50 or down to 25.

22
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,360


23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,600
For now, we're taking this tree as given but,

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,710
as I mentioned before, in practice we would calibrate it

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,070
based on a statistical analysis of the underlying stock

26
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,300
returns.

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,490
Also notice that we chose the outcomes

28
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,890
starting at 70 at time 1 and going down and also

29
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,300
the outcome starting at 35 and going up to be identical.

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,380


31
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,780
Restricting the evolution of stock prices

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,140
to ensure that this is the case creates what's

33
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,930
called a recombining tree.

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,140
That restriction is typically imposed because it greatly

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,919
simplifies calculations but it's not absolutely necessary.

36
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,860
We'll now use this tree to price a European call

37
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,900
option with a strike price of 50 that expires at time 2.

38
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,000
We'll continue to assume a risk-free rate

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,835
of 11% per period on a continuous basis.

40
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:24,380


41
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,050
We'll price the option working backwards on the tree

42
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,780
to find its value on every node.

43
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,650
Starting at time 2, the option is only

44
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,730
in the money at the top on the up-up node

45
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,570
where the payoff is the stock price of 100

46
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,730
minus the $50 strike price so the payoff on the call option

47
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,495
is 50.

48
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:50,780


49
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,750
The middle node has a stock price of 50

50
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,550
and there is no gain from exercising the option.

51
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,750
And at the bottom node, the call option is clearly

52
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,350
out-of-the-money.

53
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:10,050
Now at each time 1 node we can compute the option value as we

54
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,100
did with the one-step tree, by first finding the risk-neutral

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,740
probability of an up-move, q*, based on the one-period subtree

56
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,230
and then applying the probabilities to the option

57
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,680
payoffs of 50 in the up state and 0 in the down-state at time

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,180
2.

59
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,890


60
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,460
This is our subtree and we're going

61
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,020
to find the call option at time 1 in the up state

62
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,540
by discounting these two payoffs weighted by the risk

63
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,340
neutral probability.

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,660
Well, that yields the call price at time 1

65
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:56,810
on the up node C1u of 25.2083.

66
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,200
In the same way on the time 1 down node,

67
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,990
we can find the call option value

68
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,495
by looking at the one-step subproblem.

69
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,880


70
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,790
On that node we don't have to do any math

71
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,380
because if the payoffs at time 2 are all 0,

72
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,720
we know the value of the call option at time 1

73
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,480
will also be 0.

74
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,130
Now going back the last step to time 0 and again solving

75
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:37,000
the one-step subproblem, we find a q* at time 0 of 0.5947.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,130
Apply it to the call option at time 1

77
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,210
in the up state to get the expected

78
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,820
time 1 value of the call option, and then

79
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,520
we discount it back at the risk-free rate,

80
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,980
and we come to the conclusion that the call

81
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,780
option is worth 13.4294.

82
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,000
