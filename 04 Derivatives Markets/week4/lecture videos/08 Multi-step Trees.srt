1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,019
We can easily extend our two step example

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,800
to an arbitrarily large number of steps on a tree.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,100
That extension allows us to more accurately capture

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,320
the distribution of future stock prices

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,370
and the corresponding option payoffs.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,730
In the subscript pairs here, ij, we'll

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,850
let i denote the time period and j denote

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,310
the node with the highest node labeled as node one.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,530
Using risk neutral probabilities,

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,280
we can solve backwards for the value of any European style

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,490
derivative as we did in the two period case

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,930
discounting pairwise expected values one period ahead back

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,990
to the current node.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,380
The procedure is similar for American style derivatives

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,750
except that at each node, we also

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,050
have to check whether or not we want to early exercise.

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,250
When early exercise is optimal, the value at that node

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,300
reflects that choice.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,210
And it can affect the value as we work

20
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,050
backwards through the tree.

21
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,930
We'll return to multi-step trees and how they're

22
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,870
calibrated in the next lecture and also

23
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,560
use them to explain one way to derive the Black-Scholes Merton

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,670
options pricing formula.

25
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,000
I've been using risk-neutral pricing in most of the examples

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,980
here for its simplicity but I want to again emphasize

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,680
that we would have come to the same answers using

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,910
the formulas for creating a replicating portfolio.

29
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,410
It's important to remember that risk-neutral pricing does not

30
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,810
mean that people are risk-neutral

31
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,870
or that they don't care about the considerable risk

32
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,290
of options, which is a reflection of the fact

33
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,380
that there are equivalent to a leveraged position

34
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,990
in the risky underlying stock.

35
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,440
Risk-neutral pricing works by replacing

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,040
the cost of risk in our usual discount rate

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,140
with an adjustment in the risk-neutral probabilities.

38
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,800
That adjustment means that the risk-neutral probabilities

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,190
have information, not just about the probability

40
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,570
of different outcomes, but also about the price of risk

41
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,290
associated with those outcomes.

42
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,660
For a stock price tree, the risk-neutral probability, q*,

43
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,800
will turn out to be less than the physical probability, q,

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,520
which has the effect of putting more weight on lower stock

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,590
price realizations reflecting that the true discount rate is

46
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,410
higher than the risk-free rate.

47
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,650
Finally, binomial pricing has been

48
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,290
shown to work for pricing American options

49
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,140
where exercise decisions today will

50
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,420
depend on what we think those decisions will

51
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,960
be in the future.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,260
There's no simple alternative to using

53
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,980
backward induction on trees for pricing American options.

54
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,640
And luckily, as we extend the tree to many steps,

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,310
a binomial approach can often produce

56
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,080
a very accurate estimate of a derivatives value.

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,000
