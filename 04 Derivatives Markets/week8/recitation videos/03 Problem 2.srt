00:00:01,048 --> 00:00:03,590
INSTRUCTOR: Alright, now let's begin with the second topic --

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,220
pricing an American option.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,500
Assume that the following annual binomial

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,370
tree is correct for risk-neutral pricing of bonds and bond

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,790
options, where the probability of an up move

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,270
is the same as the probability of a down move, which

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,120
is equal to 0.5.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,120
In particular, the spot rate at initiation

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,610
is 3.5% and either moves up to a higher interest rate state

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,040
or down to a lower interest rate state.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,940
In the week 8 lecture, we saw how to price a European call

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,150
option on a bond using the same binomial tree,

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,420
as on the slide here.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,580
Now, can we use the same tree to price an American call option,

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,880
in which case, a three-year 5.25% annual coupon bond is

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:02,540
callable at the end of either one or two years for $99.50?

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,030
As in the week 8 lecture, the first step

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,610
is to use the binomial tree to price

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,860
a noncallable three-year 5.25% annual coupon bond,

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,150
as shown in the diagram below.

21
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,440
Since it's the same diagram that appears in the week 8 lecture,

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,990
I'm not going to repeat the calculations here,

23
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,530
but I do recommend repeating the calculations on your own

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,720
for additional practice.

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,960
Now, in order to price an American call option with

26
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,820
a strike price, K, equal to 99.50 that can be exercised

27
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,530
at the end of either one or two years, we, as usual,

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,280
work backwards through the binomial tree.

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,280
In particular, at the end of two years, that

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,740
is when T equals 2 on the binomial tree model here,

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,230
the value of the call option is as follows.

32
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,900
In the up-up node at T equals 2, the value of the call option is

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,500
the maximum of the difference between the value of the bond

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:15,540
in the up-up node, which is equal to 98.588, here,

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,470
and the strike price K of 99.50 and 0, which is equal to 0.

36
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,920
Similarly, in the up-down or down-up node,

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,510
the value of the call option is equal to the difference between

38
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,000
99.732 --

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,750
that's the value of the bond in either the up-down or down-up

40
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,160
node here --

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,870
and the strike price of 99.50, which is equal to 0.232.

42
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,410
Finally, in the down-down at T equals 2,

43
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,080
the value of the call option is equal to the maximum

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,950
of the difference between 100.689,

45
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,410
the value of the bond in the down-down node --

46
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:10,330
here -- minus 99.5, the strike price, and 0,

47
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,810
which is equal to 1.189.

48
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,090
While the calculations were pretty straightforward

49
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,080
for the T equals 2 case, things are a little bit more

50
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,690
complicated at the end of one year, that is,

51
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,210
when T equals 1, since now we have

52
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,660
to compare the value of exercising the call option at T

53
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,380
equals 1 to the value of waiting to exercise the call

54
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,530
option at T equals 2.

55
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,940
In particular, at the up node at T equals 1, --

56
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,920
that is, this node here --

57
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,550


58
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,840
the value of waiting to exercise the call option at T equals 2

59
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,720
in the next period is equal to 0.5 --

60
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,460
that is the risk-neutral probability of an up move --

61
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,050
times 0 -- that is the value of the call option in the up-up

62
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,090
node at equals 2 --

63
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,380
plus 0.5 risk-neutral probability of a down move

64
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,140
times 0.232 --

65
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,339
that is the value of the call option at equals 2 in either

66
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,220
the up-down or down-up node. --

67
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:26,330
discounted as the interest rate of 4.976% in the up node at T

68
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:33,340
equals 1, which is equal 0.110.

69
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,150
On the other hand, the value of exercising the call option

70
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,710
immediately at T equals 1 is equal to the maximum

71
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,370
of the difference between the value of the bond in the up

72
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,980
node at T equals 1, V, which is equal to 99.461,

73
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,050
minus the strike price of the call option, which is 99.5,

74
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,300
and 0, which is equal to 0.

75
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,960


76
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,680
Thus, the value of the call option in the up node at T

77
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,660
equals 1 is the maximum of the value of waiting to exercise

78
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,360
the call option, 0.110, and the value of exercising the call

79
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,080
option immediately, which is equal to 0,

80
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,440
which is itself 0.110, as it is optimal to wait to exercise

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,470
the call option at T equals 2.

82
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,100
OK, now what about the down node at T equals 1 --

83
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,240
that is, this node here?

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,290
Well, the value of waiting to exercise the call option at T

85
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,090
equals 2 is equal to 0.5, the risk-neutral probability

86
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,870
of an up move, times 0.232 --

87
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,780
that is the value of the call option at T equals 2

88
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,110
in the up-down or down up-node --

89
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,370
plus 0.5, the risk-neutral probability of a down move,

90
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,320
times 1.19 --

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,890
that's the value of the call option in the down-down node

92
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,720
at T equals 2 --

93
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,890
discounted at the risk-free rate of 4.074% in the down node at T

94
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:20,220
equals 1, which is equal to 0.683.

95
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,090
On the other hand, the value of immediately exercising the call

96
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,690
option in the down node at T equals 1 is equal

97
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,710
to the maximum of the difference between the value

98
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,670
of the noncallable bond in the down node at T equals 1,

99
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,800
which is 101.333, minus the strike price of the call option

100
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:48,010
of 99.50 and 0, which is equal to 1.833.

101
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,040
Thus, the value of the call option in the down node

102
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,460
is equal to the maximum of the value of waiting

103
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,380
to exercise the call option at T equals 2, 0.683,

104
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,490
and the value of immediately exercising the call option

105
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,920
at the down node at T equals 1 of 1.833, which is equal

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,550
to 1.833, indicating that it is indeed

107
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,550
optimal to exercise the call option at T

108
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,180
equals 1 in the down node.

109
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,180
In the final step, we can find the overall value

110
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,230
of the American call option at T equals 0, the initial node,

111
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,120
to be as follows: the value of the call option is equal

112
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,140
to the risk-neutral probability of an up move, 0.5,

113
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:43,040
times the value of the call option of 0.110 in the up node

114
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,100
at T equals 1 plus the risk-neutral probability

115
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,410
of a down move from 0.5 times the value of the call option

116
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,070
in the down node at T equals 1 of 1.833,

117
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,960
which we just found here, discounted at the prevailing

118
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:08,900
interest rate at initiation of 3.5%, which is equal to 0.938.

119
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,110
All right, one last thing before we move on to the final topic.

120
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,300
Since we went over a lot of calculations

121
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,250
over the last few slides, I thought

122
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,350
I would include the following diagram here

123
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,580
on this slide that summarizes the value of the call option

124
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,770
at each node of the binomial tree,

125
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,130
as well as the prevailing interest rate at that node.

126
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,340
Hopefully, this is a useful diagram for your reference

127
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,760
as you work through these nodes.
