JR SCOTT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the eighth
recitation of 15.435x.
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing three topics related
to the week eight lecture.
In the first topic, we'll review how
to find the price of a callable bond.
In the second topic, we'll see how
we can use the binomial model to find
the price of an American call option on a bond.
And in the third topic, we'll review
the concepts of effective duration
and effective convexity in the context
of a mortgage-backed security.
