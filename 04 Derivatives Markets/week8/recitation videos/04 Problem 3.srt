1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:02,360
PROFESSOR: All right, let's finish the recitation

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,900
by reviewing the last topic, effective duration

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,040
and effective convexity.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,190
Let's begin by recalling the definitions of modified

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,780
duration and convexity for an option-free bond from all

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,260
the way back in the week three lecture.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,480
In particular, modified duration is

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,640
related to the first derivative of

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,890
the price-yield relationship.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,160
It's negative, because prices move inversely with yields.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,690
And it's equal to the first derivative dP of the price,

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,620
with respect to the yield dy, scaled by 1 over the price.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,570
Convexity, on the other hand, is related

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,260
to the second derivative of the price-yield relationship.

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,830
Since most bonds have positive convexity,

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,820
the second derivative the price with respect to the yield,

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,480
scaled by 1 over the price, is positive.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,510
Together, modified duration and convexity

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,850
could be used to approximate the price

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,780
change of a bond associated with a small change in yields.

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,270
So dP, the price change of the bond,

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,380
is approximately equal to negative Dm, which

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,490
is the modified duration of the bond, times its price, P,

24
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,610
times the change in yields, dy, plus 1/2 times the convexity

25
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,370
times the price of the bond times the change in yields

26
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,330
squared.

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,690
This ultimately comes from a second-order Taylor series

28
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,260
expansion of the price-yield relationship.

29
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,830
But those definitions only apply to bonds

30
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,000
without any embedded options.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,760
How can we adjust our definitions

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,240
of modified duration and convexity for bonds

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,760
that have embedded options?

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,700
Well, since embedded options will affect the sensitivity

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,670
of bond prices to yields, we can use

36
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,080
effective duration and effective convexity instead.

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,240
These measures are ultimately estimated

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,770
using a model of how prices move with changes in yields.

39
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,050
For the option-free bonds that we considered

40
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,840
on the previous slide, the effective duration

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,960
and effective convexity will be exactly the same

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,160
as modified duration and standard convexity.

43
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,260
Effective duration and effective convexity

44
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,250
are very commonly-used in delta and gamma hedging strategies

45
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,740
that we reviewed in week three.

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,980
For example, hedging mortgage portfolios

47
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,230
requires using effective duration

48
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,530
and effective convexity, because the prepayment

49
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,310
option of a mortgage is a type of American call option.

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,220
Formally, we can define effective duration

51
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,860
as follows in equation one.

52
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,090
Effective duration is equal to 1 over the price of the bond

53
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,120
initially before interest rates change

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,670
times the difference between the price

55
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,480
of the bond after interest rates fall and the price of the bond

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,850
after interest rates rise divided

57
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,410
by 2 times s, where s is the amount the interest rates rise

58
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,370
or fall.

59
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,760
In the case of duration, this is for a level shift

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,360
in the yield curve.

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,470
Note that this equation one and definition

62
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,010
of effective duration is conceptually quite similar

63
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,980
to the definition of modified duration,

64
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,450
except now we replace the first derivative of the change

65
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,850
in the price of the bond for the change in yield

66
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,470
with its corresponding difference quotient.

67
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,370
Similarly, effective convexity is defined as 1

68
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,180
over the initial price of the bond times the difference

69
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,490
between the price after rates fall

70
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,680
minus the initial price of the bond

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,010
minus the difference between the initial price of the bond

72
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,460
minus the price after rates rise, now divided

73
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,480
by the change in interest rates squared.

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,020
Conceptually, this is, again, quite similar to the definition

75
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,590
of convexity we saw earlier, except now

76
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,160
the second derivative of the bond's price with respect

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,460
to the change in yields is replaced by its difference

78
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,440
quotient.

79
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,010
Just like before, we can use effective duration

80
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,860
and effective convexity to approximate the price

81
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,740
change of a bond with embedded options

82
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,140
for a small change in yields.

83
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,140
Equation three is identical to the equation that we

84
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:36,560
saw earlier, this one here, except now modified duration

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,750
and standard convexity are replaced

86
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,470
with effective duration and effective convexity.

87
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,540
All right, since those definitions

88
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,480
of effective duration and effective convexity

89
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,020
are rather abstract, let's see if we can illuminate things

90
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,790
with an empirical example.

91
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,060
Suppose that a mortgage-backed security

92
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,810
has an estimated price-yield relationship summarized

93
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,580
in the following figure.

94
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,590
Such a relationship like this usually

95
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,510
comes from a model that's estimated

96
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,680
using historical data.

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,320
In part a we are asked, if yields are currently

98
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,160
at 5.5%, what is the effective duration

99
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,430
and effective convexity for the mortgage-backed security?

100
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,410
Well, according to the figure, the price

101
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:28,810
of the mortgage-backed security is $97 when yields are at 5.5%.

102
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,730
So here, when the yield is 5.5%, the price per $100

103
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,640
face value is $97.

104
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,610
In order to apply equations one and equations two--

105
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,430
in order to find the effective duration and effective

106
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,970
convexity of the mortgage-backed security, respectively--

107
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,160
we can consider a 0.5% increase or decrease in yields.

108
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,710
So s is equal to 0.005 as a decimal.

109
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,560
A 0.5% increase or decrease in yields

110
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,320
is small enough such that the first-order

111
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,190
and second-order Taylor series expansions are justified.

112
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,250
From the figure, the price of the mortgage-backed security

113
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:18,580
is $100 when yields fall to 5%, so here.

114
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:26,570
And it's equal to $92 when yields rise to 6% here.

115
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,370
So from equation one, we can find the effective duration

116
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,370
of the mortgage-backed security as follows.

117
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,250
It's equal to 1 over the initial price--

118
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,200
well, $97 is the price when yields are 5.5%--

119
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,650
times the difference between the price when rates fall to 5%

120
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,360
of 100 minus the price when rates rise to 6%

121
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,390
of 92 divided by 2 times s, which is 2 times 0.005,

122
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,220
which is equal to 8.247.

123
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,270
Similarly, from equation two, the effective convexity

124
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,110
of the mortgage-backed security is 1 over the initial price

125
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,970
of 97 times the difference between the price after rates

126
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,700
fall of 100 minus the initial price of 97 minus the initial

127
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:28,420
price of 97 minus the price after rates rise of 92 divided

128
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,430
by 0.005 squared, which is equal to--

129
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:39,310
get ready-- negative 824.74.

130
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,620
In this case, the mortgage-backed security

131
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,080
actually has negative convexity.

132
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,880
And that's very different from what

133
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,880
we saw with most standard bonds earlier in this course.

134
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,230
This, however, is actually typical for mortgage bonds

135
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,690
as well as for callable bonds more

136
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,540
generally when yields are very low.

137
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,020
That is when they are more likely to be called.

138
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,630
All right, that ends recitation eight.

139
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,190
Thank you everyone for coming.

140
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,660
And I look forward to seeing you next week.
