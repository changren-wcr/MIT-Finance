1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,760
PROFESSOR: Without further ado, let's

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,530
begin with the first topic.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,820
Suppose that you have estimated the following binomial model

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,570
for one-year interest rates, where the probability of rates

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,260
rising or falling equals 50%.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,170
In particular, the interest rate either increases

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,300
to 5.5% next period or decreases to 3.9%.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,030


9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,360
In part a, we are asked, using this model, what

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,440
is the theoretical price of a two-year 6% coupon

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,690
bond with no options attached?

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,530
Assume that the coupon payments are paid annually

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,230
and the face value of the bond is $100.

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,770
As always, let's move backwards through the binomial tree

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,310
in order to solve this problem.

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,890
At the end of two years, the holder of the bond

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,490
will receive the face value of $100

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,450
plus an annual coupon payment of $6.

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,110
Since the diagram above shows the evolution of one-year

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,040
interest rates --

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,350
that is the interest rate between the beginning of one

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,600
year and the end of the year --

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,570
the appropriate discount rate for the payoff received

24
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:22,950
at the end of two years is equal to 1.04 for 4% times 1.055

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:31,242
for 5.5% in the up node, and 1.04 times 1.039

26
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:38,610
for 3.9%, which is equal to 1.08056 in the down node.

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,560
Since there is a 50% chance of rates either rising or falling,

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,680
the expected discounted payoff received

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,590
at the end of two years is as follows: 0.5 times the terminal

30
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,950
payoff of 106 divided by 1.04 times 1.039

31
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:08,430
for the down node plus 0.5 times 106 divided by 1.04 times 1.055

32
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:14,480
for the up node, which is equal to 97.35.

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,410
Now, the holder of the bond will also receive a coupon payment

34
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,530
of $6 at the end of one year -- remember,

35
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,750
these are annual coupon payments --

36
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,640
which has a present value of simply 6 divided by the spot

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,120
interest rate at initiation of 4%,

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,430
or 1.04 as a decimal, which is equal to 5.77.

39
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,700
Thus, the price of the two-year 6% coupon

40
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,090
bond with no options attached is simply

41
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,020
5.77, the present value of the coupon payment

42
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,280
received at the end of one year, plus 97.35,

43
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,500
the present value of the face value

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,960
plus coupon payment received at the end of two years,

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,050
which is equal to 103.12.

46
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,680
In part b, we are asked to consider the same bond

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,980
as in part a but with a call option that now allows

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,610
the issuer to call the bond at the end of the first year

49
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,100
for $101.

50
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,740
What is the value of this call option?

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,480
What would be the theoretical value of the callable bond?

52
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,390
We'll begin by recalling from the week eight lecture

53
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,670
that the value of a callable bond

54
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,790
is equal to the value of a non-callable bond

55
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,660
minus the value of the embedded call option.

56
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,260
We know from part a that the value of the non-callable bond

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,810
is 103.12.

58
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,050
So we just need to find the value of the call option

59
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,540
on the bond using the same binomial tree.

60
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,900
In particular, let's let the payoff of the call option

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,790
at each node, which can either be up for u or down for d,

62
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,160
at the end of the first year to be equal to C is equal

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,760
to the maximum of the difference between P sub i and K and 0,

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,520
were P sub i is the value of the non-callable bond in each node

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,020
--

66
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,149
which can either be up or down --

67
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,450
and K, which is equal to 101, is the strike price

68
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,460
of the call option.

69
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,590
Well, using the binomial tree given,

70
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,860
we can first find the value of the non-callable bond

71
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,300
in the up node to be the terminal payoff of 106

72
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,460
discounted at the spot rate in the up node of 5.5%, which

73
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,220
is equal to 100.47.

74
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,120
So the call option payoff in the up node

75
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,340
is equal to the maximum of the difference between 100.47

76
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,990
and the strike price of 101 and 0, which is equal to 0.

77
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,300
A similar calculation for the down node

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,180
shows that the value of the non-callable bond

79
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,090
in the down node is equal to 106 divided by 1.039,

80
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,420
which is equal to 102.02.

81
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,510
And the payoff of the call option in the down node

82
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,640
is equal to the maximum of the difference between 102.02

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,010
minus 101 and 0, which is equal to 1.02.

84
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,440
Since the value of the call option

85
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,600
is the present value of the expected

86
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,000
payoffs of the option at the end of the first year,

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
we simply take 0, which is the value of the call

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,770
option at the end of the first year

89
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,850
and the up node, multiplied by the probability of an up

90
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,870
move of 0.5, discounted at the risk-free rate

91
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,840
of 4% at the initial node, plus the probability of a down move

92
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,890
of 0.5 times the payoff of the call option

93
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,780
in the down node of 1.02 discounted at the 4% interest

94
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,020
rate, which gives us a total value of the call

95
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,040
option of 0.49.

96
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Now, since the value of the callable bond

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,120
is the difference between the value of the non-callable bond

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,650
and the value of the embedded call option,

99
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,860
we know that the value of the callable bond

100
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:30,520
must be equal to 103.12 minus 0.49, which is equal to 102.63.

101
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,083
