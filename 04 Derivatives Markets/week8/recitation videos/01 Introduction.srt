JR SCOTT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the eighth

1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,790
recitation of 15.435x.

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,240
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing three topics related

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,580
to the week eight lecture.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,800
In the first topic, we'll review how

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,690
to find the price of a callable bond.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,450
In the second topic, we'll see how

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,730
we can use the binomial model to find

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,250
the price of an American call option on a bond.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,340
And in the third topic, we'll review

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,590
the concepts of effective duration

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,650
and effective convexity in the context

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,430
of a mortgage-backed security.
