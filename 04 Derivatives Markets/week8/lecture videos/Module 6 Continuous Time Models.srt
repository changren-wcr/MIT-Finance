00:00:01,337 --> 00:00:03,670
PROFESSOR: The name of the game in pricing interest rate

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,880
sensitive derivatives is to model the stochastic properties

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,620
of the term structure of interest rates

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,100
as accurately as possible, while at the same time

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,990
avoiding excessive complexity that

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,120
doesn't improve performance but that

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,760
slows down computation times.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,170
Many of the models that have been

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,070
developed with this goal in mind are continuous time models.

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,010
I want to give you a sense of what these models look like

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,780
and how they're used for pricing,

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,840
but we only have time to scratch the surface of this very

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,290
interesting topic and I won't ask you any difficult questions

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,690
about it on the final.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,630
A large class of continuous time models for interest rates

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,380
are known as one-factor models in the short rate.

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,490
In these models, the short rate is, in fact, very short.

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,420
It's instantaneous.

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,620
That means that it covers an infinitesimally short period

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,450
of time.

21
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,700
The general form of this class of models

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,880
is described by this equation for the change

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,700
in the instantaneous short rate over time.

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,160


25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:14,140
The change has a deterministic drift term given by a function,

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,110
a of rt, and a volatility term parameterized by a function,

27
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,280
sigma of r and t.

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
The function sigma of r and t is multiplied

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,190
by dz, where dz is an increment to a Brownian motion.

30
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,240
You can think of dz as a draw from a standard normal density

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,340
function.

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,600
Notice that both the drift and the volatility

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,550
can depend on the current level of

34
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:50,290
the instantaneous short rate, r, and current calendar time.

35
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,300
The different models in this class

36
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,330
are distinguished by the specifications that

37
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,445
are chosen for the drift function,

38
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:03,140
a of rt, and the volatility function, sigma of r and t.

39
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,860
These models are called one-factor models

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,320
because the rate change only depends

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,980
on a single stochastic shock term.

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,060
Some model implementations are based on physical probabilities

43
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,760
but the ones used for pricing are generally

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,400
the risk-neutral versions of the models.

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,370
Like the short rate models that we've been looking at,

46
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,440
because the models have implications

47
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,830
for bond prices of any possible maturity,

48
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,800
the entire term structure of interest rates

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,590
at any future point in time is also implicit in the model.

50
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,450
These one-factor models generally

51
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,990
bear the name of the researchers that first proposed them.

52
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,780
The reason that no major new models in this class

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,090
have been proposed in the last 30 years

54
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,010
is that all the possible variations

55
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,460
are pretty much covered by these existing models.

56
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,070
Since that time, though, interest

57
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,130
has shifted to continuous time models of the forward rate

58
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,120
curve rather than models of the instantaneous spot rates.

59
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,340
Those forward rate models are much more

60
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,730
complicated to understand and you can get the basic idea

61
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,880
from the one-factor models so for today, I'm

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,280
going to stick to these.

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,500
The whole textbook, though, is a good place

64
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,510
to look if you're interested in learning more

65
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,300
about the more complex models for forward rates,

66
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,870
which include the Heath, Jarrow, and Morton model and the LIBOR

67
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,860
market model.

68
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,020
One of the most famous one-factor models

69
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,070
is the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model, or CIR for short.

70
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,130
That model sets the drift to be mean reverting,

71
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,480
so that if the current instantaneous rate, r, is

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,990
above the long-term target rate, b,

73
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,030
the drift tends to be negative.

74
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,430
And if the current rate is below the target rate,

75
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,650
the drift is positive.

76
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,170
That reflects the idea that interest rates usually

77
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,660
stay within some normal range rather

78
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,430
than drifting up or drifting down for a very long time.

79
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,340
The speed of mean reversion is controlled by the choice

80
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,735
of the parameter, alpha.

81
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:17,480


82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,180
The volatility is based on a constant parameter, sigma,

83
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,990
multiplied by the square root of the current instantaneous short

84
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,410
rate and by an increment to a Brownian motion, dz.

85
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,360
The purpose of the square root term

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,830
is to reduce the variance as the rate gets close to 0.

87
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,020
That has the effect of preventing rates

88
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,680
from going negative, which under many interest rate conditions

89
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,680
is a desirable attribute.

90
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,360
A convenient feature of this model

91
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,630
is that it can be solved to get an equation for the yield curve

92
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,090
in terms of all these parameter values

93
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,520
and the current level of the instantaneous short rate.

94
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,000
You can see the stochastic path that this model generates

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
and also see how the parameter choices affect the implied

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,380
yield curve using the spreadsheet CIR demo

97
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,460
mm.xls, which is included with the class materials.

98
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,050


99
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,790
It's good to know that there's also

100
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,760
a multi-factor version of this model available

101
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,120
that can generate a much richer set of shapes for the yield

102
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,060
curve.

103
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,610
To price options using the CIR model,

104
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,950
or any other continuous time model,

105
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,940
the basic choices are to either use Monte Carlo simulation

106
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,880
or to represent the model in a discretized form

107
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,950
on a binomial tree.

108
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,440
As we solve for stock options, it's

109
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,160
convenient to use Monte Carlo for European-style options

110
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,840
where there's no choice about whether

111
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,690
or not to early exercise the option.

112
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,030
Implementing these models using Monte Carlo

113
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,930
involves three steps.

114
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,010
The first is to discretize a risk-neutral version

115
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,360
of the model.

116
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,200
That allows you to then generate short-term paths of interest

117
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,680
rates using a random number generator to get draws

118
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,170
from a standard normal density function.

119
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,690
Remember that we discussed how to do that in Excel last week.

120
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,710
The discretized version of the general one-factor model

121
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,165
can be written like this.

122
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:24,090


123
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,940
It says that the short-term rate at the next time step,

124
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:36,220
time t plus delta t, is the rate at time t

125
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,110
plus the drift function times the size of the time

126
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:49,090
step, delta t, plus a volatility term based on the function

127
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,890
sigma of r and t, the draw from the standard normal density,

128
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,420
epsilon of t, and the square root of the time

129
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,690
increment, root delta t.

130
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,760
The term, epsilon t, times the square root of delta t

131
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,360
is the discrete representation of the dz

132
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,500
in the original equation.

133
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,280


134
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,190
The second step is to calculate the implied term structure

135
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,290
of interest rates as of time 0.

136
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,290
If you have a closed form solution for the yield curve,

137
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,310
as in the case of the CIR model, you can use that.

138
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,170
It's more likely though that you'll

139
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,990
have to infer the term structure from pricing zero-coupon bonds

140
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,980
of various maturities.

141
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,220
To price a cheap period zero-coupon bonds using Monte

142
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,460
Carlo, you discount the payoff on the bond

143
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,990
at time cap t, its maturity, back to time 0

144
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,950
by compounding the short-term rates along each Monte Carlo

145
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,470
path.

146
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,650
Averaging the implied prices across a large number

147
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,220
of Monte Carlo paths gives the price

148
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,420
estimate for the bond at time 0.

149
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,180
Then the yield implied by the average price

150
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,120
is the t period yield and the yield curve.

151
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,100
Depending on what you're trying to do,

152
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,130
you may also need to calculate the term structure

153
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,860
on future dates, such as on the expiration

154
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,200
date of an option you're pricing along each path at that date.

155
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,170
You would need to do that, for example, to figure out

156
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,180
the distribution of a bond's price

157
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,660
on that future date as an input into calculating the payoff

158
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,780
on a put or call option on that bond.

159
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,490
You can follow the same procedure

160
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,669
I just described starting with the rate on each path

161
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,360
at the expiration date and solving for the term structure

162
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,080
starting at that point, based on another large number

163
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,530
of additional Monte Carlo simulations.

164
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,220
As you can see, this can all require a very large number

165
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,130
of computations, but it's made feasible

166
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,010
by the availability of high-speed computing.

167
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,900


168
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,480
The third and final step is to find the payoff

169
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,220
on the option you're trying to price

170
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,970
on each path on the expiration date.

171
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,890
The option payoff on each path is discounted back to time 0,

172
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,590
again, using the product of successive rates

173
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,860
along the path for discounting.

174
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,470
The average of those time 0 present values

175
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,410
across simulated paths is your estimate of the option value.

176
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,650
This is also a good time to say a word

177
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,080
about calibrating these models.

178
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,680
In these models, the drift function and the volatility

179
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,120
function are where you have free variables available to tune

180
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,530
the model to match current bond price data and current option

181
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,150
price data.

182
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,340
The process for doing that generally

183
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,210
involves a nonlinear fitting optimization program.

184
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,190


185
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,800
Continuous time models can also be discretized

186
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,020
in a way that's consistent with representing them

187
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,880
on a binomial tree.

188
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,490
As I've emphasized, that can be necessary

189
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,650
when the optimal exercise policy needs

190
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,180
to be determined at the same time

191
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,030
as option value is being calculated.

192
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,360
Again, starting with the general equation for one-factor models

193
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,760
of the instantaneous interest rates,

194
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,860
a binomial tree can be calibrated

195
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,790
using these equations for the up or down node where r is

196
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,980
the value on the previous node.

197
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,570


198
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,900
Because these models represent very short-term rates,

199
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,120
it takes a very large number of steps

200
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,580
to approximate the original continuous time

201
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,020
model with any accuracy.

202
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,410
Once again, we've covered a lot of ground this week.

203
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,480
The theme has been on pricing options

204
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,160
on fixed income securities and directly on interest rates.

205
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,490
We saw that because the statistical properties of bonds

206
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,760
are often not well behaved, it's typical to start

207
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,870
with a model of the statistical process for interest rates.

208
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,950
Nevertheless, the options prices that come out of these modeling

209
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,090
approaches rest on no arbitrage logic and the fact

210
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,480
that option payoffs can be replicated by a dynamic trading

211
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,750
strategy in the underlying fixed-income securities

212
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,270
and a risk free bond.

213
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,240
You'll get some further practice with pricing

214
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,920
using binomial trees and interest

215
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,140
rates in the recitation and in the homework problems.
