1
00:00:00,927 --> 00:00:03,260
PROFESSOR: We'll now turn to options pricing models that

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,330
rest on assumptions about the underlying

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,880
distribution of interest rates rather than of bond prices.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,640
To price options on fixed income securities,

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,000
it's important to recognize that this often requires not just

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,840
modeling the distribution of a particular future rate,

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,770
but rather a model of the stochastic evolution

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,010
of the entire term structure of interest rates or the yield

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,660
curve.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,150
You need to be able to answer the question,

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,960
how are spot and forward rates expected to move over time

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,870
and what's the volatility of those movements?

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,950
We'll start by building answers to those questions,

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,430
starting with binomial models of short term interest rates

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,980
and how to calibrate them to market data

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,820
and then use them to price interest rate derivatives.

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,650
Then we'll look at some continuous time

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,840
models of stochastic yield curves

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,720
and how they can be used for pricing by Monte

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,220
Carlo or binomial methods.

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,050
This figure shows a binomial tree

22
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,080
that represents the time evolution of the short term

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,340
risk free interest rate.

24
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,750


25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,940
As with any binomial model, choices

26
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,830
have to be made about what determines

27
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,830
the value of the underlying variable at each node, which

28
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,130
in this case is a short term interest rate and about

29
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,820
the probabilities of an up and a down move at each node.

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,090
For tractability and to avoid overfitting,

31
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,030
the evolution of interest rates and the associated

32
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,330
probabilities are restricted by a set of rules.

33
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,730
Different models are distinguished by how

34
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,920
those rules are set.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,220
As in the earlier binomial models we've worked with,

36
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,180
the model can be either physical or risk neutral.

37
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,440
For pricing purposes, the risk neutral version of the models

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,770
is typically used.

39
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,260
For other applications, like understanding

40
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,480
the physical distribution of outcomes,

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,500
for instance to calculate the value of risk for a portfolio,

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,229
physical probabilities are used instead.

43
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,990
In all cases we want to use a model that

44
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,810
produces realistic predictions about the prices

45
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,120
of the fixed income securities and options

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,800
that we want to use the model for.

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,530


48
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,920
Volatility is a key input for all stochastic interest rate

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,500
models and options pricing models.

50
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,590
As before, the vertical distance between nodes

51
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,520
on a tree at a point in time is how volatility is incorporated

52
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,900
into a binomial model.

53
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,870
Rate volatility can be estimated from historical data

54
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,040
or it can be inferred using implied volatilities

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,090
from option prices.

56
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,220
The formulas here are a reminder of how

57
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,410
to estimate interest rate volatility using

58
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,240
historical data.

59
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,640
As usual, the first step is to choose

60
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,235
the relevant historical period and collect data.

61
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:02,970


62
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,810
A natural question is, how long to look back historically.

63
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,750
Unfortunately, there's no general answer

64
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,630
to that question because there's always a trade off

65
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,370
between having enough data to come up

66
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,790
with a reliable estimate and avoiding using data that's

67
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,070
too old and that may be no longer

68
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,080
relevant to the current environment.

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,070
Judgment must always be exercised.

70
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,010
The second step is to calculate the standard deviation

71
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,330
of yields.

72
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,340
Note here that standard deviations

73
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,520
are calculated in terms of proportional interest rate

74
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,800
changes, not level changes.

75
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,810
But either approach can be used.

76
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,930
And how the information is incorporated into a tree

77
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,300
will be different with a multiplicative factor

78
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,280
in the case of proportional changes

79
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,660
and with an additive one with level changes.

80
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,320
Volatility of course, is based on the standard deviation,

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,340
here using daily data annualized by multiplying

82
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,030
by a factor of either the square root of 365

83
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,060
or the square root of 250.

84
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,460
The former reflects the idea that volatility

85
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,800
on trading days and online trading days

86
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,180
is similar, even if you can't see it on the nontrading days.

87
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,120
The latter reflects the idea that volatility only

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,430
occurs on trading days.

89
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,790
The truth probably lies somewhere in between.

90
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,820
As with other variables used in calibrations

91
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,280
the choice of volatility can be fine tuned

92
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,820
to produce a model that most accurately reproduces observed

93
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,070
security and options prices.

94
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,310
In either case, scaling by a square root factor

95
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,250
based on a number of days reflects the assumption

96
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,800
that rate changes are independent over time.

97
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,740
Here's an example of using this procedure

98
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,720
to estimate proportional interest rate

99
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,270
changes based on daily data on one year rates.

100
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,790
The first percentage change here is

101
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,190
based on the difference between the first two

102
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,480
daily observations.

103
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:10,260


104
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,440
The standard deviation of daily changes,

105
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,710
found here to be 0.00857, in this particular example

106
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,090
was annualized by multiplying by the square root of 365

107
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:32,980
to give an annualized volatility of 0.1638 or 16.38%.

108
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,570
A very simple model of the evolution of short term rates

109
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,300
assumes that the rate on the up node

110
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,550
is the rate on the previous time step multiplied by 1 plus D,

111
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,800
where D is a fixed constant.

112
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,050
The rate on the down node is the rate

113
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,420
of the previous time step divided

114
00:05:52,420 --> 00:06:00,180
by 1 plus D. This creates a recombining tree

115
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,620
Let's assume that the initial rate is 4%

116
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,620
and that the risk neutral probability of an up move

117
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,230
is 0.5.

118
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,520
If we equate the D parameter to our estimate

119
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,250
of an annualized proportional standard deviation.

120
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,500
And if each step on the tree represents one year,

121
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,370
we can get a 2-step tree calibrated to the volatility

122
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,620
estimate we just calculated.

123
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,330
And that's shown here.

124
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,530
For shorter time steps, we use the annualized estimate

125
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,440
multiplied by the square root of the time interval,

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,650
for instance multiplying by the square root of 0.5

127
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,390
for a period of six months.

128
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,480
The algebra here in the blue box establishes

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,450
that equating D to the volatility, in this case,

130
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,380
produces a standard deviation of rate changes in the tree that's

131
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,960
consistent with the estimated volatility.

132
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,790


133
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,050
So far we've seen an example of how the evolution of short term

134
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,780
rates can be represented on a binomial tree

135
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,690
and how rate volatility can be incorporated into the model.

136
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,690
But what we need to price bond options

137
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,090
is not just a model of the evolution of short term rates

138
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,540
but of the entire yield curve.

139
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,910
An extremely important observation

140
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,480
that you should definitely spend some time to really understand

141
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
is this.

142
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,050
Implicit in any bond pricing model

143
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,900
based on the evolution of short term rates

144
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,760
is also a model of the evolution of the entire yield curve.

145
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,300
To see why that's true, let's look at a very simple example

146
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,300
based on the first step of the risk neutral binomial tree

147
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,610
we just constructed.

148
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,130
The key will be to recall that the yield curve can

149
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,270
be derived from bond prices.

150
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,870
So if a tree can be used to price bonds

151
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,000
of different maturities, it can also

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,580
be used to find the implied yield curve.

153
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,810
This is most straightforward to do by using the implied

154
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,835
prices of zero coupon bonds.

155
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:05,370


156
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,400
The one year spot rate here is 4%.

157
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,920
And it goes up to 4.66 in one year or down to 3.44.

158
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,350
To find a two year spot yield, we

159
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,090
use this tree to find the time zero price of a two year

160
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,270
zero coupon bond with a face value of 100.

161
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,650
We're going to do this working backward through the tree.

162
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,020
But the difference from what we did earlier

163
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,140
is that instead of using a constant value for the risk

164
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,110
free rate we'll be discounting using

165
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,289
the rates at the different points on the tree.

166
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,720
For example, the price of the bond

167
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,630
at time one, when the bond has one year left

168
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,440
to maturity and on the up node where the rate is 4.66%

169
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,820
is 100 divided by 1.0466 which gives us

170
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:06,840
a price on that node of 95.547.

171
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:13,020
On the down node, the bond is worth 96.674,

172
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:20,170
found by discounting at the 3.44% rate on that node.

173
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,410
Using the risk neutral probability of 0.5,

174
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,440
the expected value of the bond at time one

175
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,375
is the numerator in this equation.

176
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,590


177
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,860
The value that is discounted back to time

178
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,840
zero using the one year rate of 4%

179
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:45,050
to give a time 0 price of 92.414.

180
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,550
The two year yield implicit in the zero coupon bond price

181
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,040
is found then in the usual way by asking what yield equates

182
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,960
the bond price with the discounted

183
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,660
value of its promised payoff of 102 years.

184
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,800


185
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,670
Solving for y2 gives a two year spot yield

186
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,975
of 4.02% stated as a simple annual percentage rate.

187
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,620


188
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,430
To generalize, what this example establishes

189
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,880
is that starting from any node on a binomial tree

190
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,130
you can use the model of short rates

191
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,300
and risk neutral probabilities to infer the prices of zero

192
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,600
coupon bonds of any maturity.

193
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,420
Thus embedded in a binomial model of short rates

194
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,630
is also a model of the entire future yield

195
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,500
curve from the perspective of any node on the tree.

196
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,000
