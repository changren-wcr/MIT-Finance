PROFESSOR: The focus this week is

1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,500
on the pricing of options on fixed income securities

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,700
and interest rates.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,100
As in week three, when we discussed forward

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,920
future and swap contracts related to the fixed income

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,830
market, the fundamental driver of risk

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,079
is the volatility of interest rates.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,560
I encourage you to review the week three material together

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,750
with what's covered in the lecture today

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,000
to see the connections and develop

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,750
a more complete understanding of fixed income derivatives.

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,970
The pricing models we'll look at fall

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,860
into two broad categories--

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,700
models of stochastic bond prices and models

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,770
of stochastic interest rates.

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,040
The first category falls under the heading of Black-Scholes

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,570
Merton style models.

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,480
We'll see why the BSM model doesn't work well

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,560
for pricing bond options and discuss why Black's model is

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,260
sometimes used instead.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,710
Most options pricing models in the fixed income world

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,980
actually start with models of stochastic short-term interest

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,100
rates, and those will be our main focus.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,980
The models are used to infer stochastic bond

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,970
prices, stochastic yield curves, and the value

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,090
of associated options and other derivatives.

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,020
We'll start with binomial models of short-term rates, which

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,480
are a very versatile tool for valuation

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,990
and especially practical for American-style options.

29
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,930
Then we'll briefly turn to continuous time interest rate

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,500
models and how they're implemented to price options.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,000
