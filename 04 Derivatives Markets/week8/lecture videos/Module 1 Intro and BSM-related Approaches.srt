PROFESSOR: Many fixed income securities

1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,670
have options that are embedded into their contractual terms.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,070
Those include corporate and government bonds

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,600
that contain a call or put provision.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,290
It also includes prepayable mortgages that

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,160
give borrowers a call option.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,290
Other options in the fixed income marketplace

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,000
are standalone contracts that are

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,840
traded on exchanges or in the over-the-counter market.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,590
Those include options on futures contracts for Treasury notes

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,200
and bonds and on short-term rates,

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,460
the trade on exchanges, and options on interest rates,

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,470
such as caps, floors, and collars,

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,640
and swaptions that often trade in the over-the-counter market,

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,000
although they're sometimes also embedded in other contracts.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,520
You might think that bond options could be priced just

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,310
like stock options, substituting bond

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,530
prices in the place of stock prices

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,790
and using the same formulas and procedures as before.

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,010
While that idea is broadly correct,

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,890
the models we've studied often do a very poor job

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,379
of pricing options in the fixed income world

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,010
because of the major differences in the statistical behavior

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,980
of bond prices and of stock prices.

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,710
Specifically, the critical assumptions

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,350
underlying the traditional Black-Scholes-Merton options

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,810
pricing model are often seriously

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,540
violating for bond prices.

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,490
The problematic assumptions include,

29
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,060
first, a constant volatility parameter.

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,300
Second, that prices are lognormally

31
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,610
distributed and unbounded.

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,680
And, third, that the risk free rate is constant.

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,510
Furthermore, many bond options are

34
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,590
American style and early exercises frequently optimal.

35
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,370
Similar statistical problems arise using binomial models

36
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,330
in bond prices.

37
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,180


38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,940
We'll see shortly that the way to address these issues

39
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,370
is to drive the price of the options

40
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,180
on fixed income securities using stochastic models of interest

41
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,220
rates not bond prices.

42
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,470


43
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,380
This example provides a very dramatic demonstration

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,260
of how directly applying the Black-Scholes-Merton model

45
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,260
to price bond options can fail.

46
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,020
Consider a three-year European call option

47
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,320
with a strike price of $110 written

48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,180
on a three-year zero coupon bond with a face value of $100.

49
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,420
Clearly the option is worthless because the bond will pay off

50
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,600
$100 with certainty at the end of the three years

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,770
and the option will always expire out of the money.

52
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,020
But if someone hadn't thought about this

53
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,990
and instead tried to use the Black-Scholes-Merton model

54
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,720
with standard assumptions reflecting current interest

55
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,950
rates and observed bond price volatilities, say, they

56
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,540
saw an interest rate of 10% and estimated a 4% annual bond

57
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,270
price volatility, they would then

58
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:02,770
conclude that the option was worth 7.78 not 0.

59
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,750
One of the most important reasons

60
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,110
that models for stock options fail when directly applied

61
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,160
to bond options is the constant volatility parameter

62
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,750
assumption.

63
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,810
The graph here illustrates the critical difference

64
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,450
for stocks and for bonds.

65
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,910
On this figure the x-axis represents

66
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,590
the horizon one is looking forward

67
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,140
to from the perspective of time 0

68
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,540
and the y-axis is the volatility of the underlying asset price.

69
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,050
For assets like stocks whose prices can be reasonably

70
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,520
approximated by a lognormal distribution,

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,850
the volatility, as a function of horizon,

72
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,000
is given by the volatility parameter

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,330
sigma multiplied by the square root of the time horizon.

74
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,790
Thus, the volatility can be represented

75
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,960
by a fixed parameter sigma.

76
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,180
And the pattern looks like this with volatility

77
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,630
as a function of horizon.

78
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,630
The price volatility of bonds is primarily

79
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,600
driven by changes in interest rates.

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,850
Initially, volatility of bond prices

81
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,209
also increases with horizon because interest rates

82
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,190
become more uncertain looking forward

83
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,674
over a longer time period.

84
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:24,570


85
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,350
However, there's a second offsetting effect that

86
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,151
isn't present for stocks, that's--

87
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,260
that the remaining duration of the bond

88
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,810
becomes shorter as time passes.

89
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,050
We know that the price sensitivity to interest rate

90
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,600
changes is proportional to duration.

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,930
So as duration shrinks, so does the volatility

92
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,580
of the bond price.

93
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,330
That's what's called a pull-to-par, where

94
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,160
at the bond's maturity date there's

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,530
no uncertainty about its value, which

96
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,360
will be equal to its par value.

97
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,425
Despite the problems that we saw arise

98
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,050
applying the Black-Scholes-Merton model

99
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,190
to bond options, a variant of it, Black's model,

100
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,900
is often used for short dated options on longer term bonds.

101
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,170
Recall the Black's model is popular for pricing commodities

102
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,030
and futures options.

103
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,170
In general, it's applicable when two conditions hold.

104
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,620
First, the option payoff depends only

105
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,280
on the value of a variable at a particular point in time

106
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,400
but not on the path it took to get there.

107
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,430
And, second, that it's reasonable to assume

108
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,270
that the distribution of the variable at that point in time

109
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,480
is normally or lognormally distributed.

110
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,100
The formula is shown here is for a lognormal distribution.

111
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,610
Those assumptions are often realistic for bond options

112
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,430
when the life of the option is much shorter than the maturity

113
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,190
of the underlying bond.

114
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,100
Looking back at the graph we just talked about,

115
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,980
you can see that early in the life

116
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,340
of the bond, the pattern of volatility is much the same

117
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,520
as it is for a stock.

118
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,010
Therefore, it's reasonable to treat the distribution

119
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,860
of the future price at short horizons

120
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,590
as being lognormally distributed.

121
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,810
Black's model is versatile and it's

122
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,390
used for a variety of applications.

123
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,430
Along with commodities and futures options,

124
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,850
it's also frequently used to price and quote

125
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,550
interest rate caps, and floors, and swaptions.

126
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,320


127
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,920
As a reminder, this slide shows the Black's model formulas,

128
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,610
which we also looked at a few weeks ago.

129
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,450
You can find it programmed into the Excel spreadsheet

130
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,750
available on the course materials page called

131
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,080
BSMandBlacksmodel.xls.

132
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,530
In the recitation, you'll see a numerical example

133
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,680
of how it can be used to price short dated options on longer

134
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,500
maturity bonds.

135
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,000
