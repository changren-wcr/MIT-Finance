00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,963


1
00:00:00,963 --> 00:00:02,380
PROFESSOR: Up to this point, we've

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,990
taken the interest rate tree used to price the callable

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,870
bond as given.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,840
Of course, in practice, analysts have to calibrate and test

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,970
their models against actual price data

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,800
to have enough confidence in the models

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,220
to use them to price derivative products sold to customers

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,640
or depend on the models in designing and executing

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,740
trading strategies.

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
The procedure for calibrating tree models

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,210
is typically iterative.

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,650
The first step is to fix some parameters at observed values

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,990
or assume values and then to guess

14
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,760
the value of other parameters that

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,010
are free variables in the calibration.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,990


17
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,480
Under those assumptions, the second step

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,420
is to calculate the value of a set of bonds and options

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,985
where market prices can be reliably observed.

20
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:51,570


21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,780
The third step is to compare the estimated prices

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,710
with the observed prices.

23
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,380
If the two sets of values differ,

24
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,450
then the free parameters need to be

25
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,000
modified in a direction that's expected

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,090
to reduce the divergence.

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,000
Those steps are repeated until the gap between the model

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,880
prediction and observed prices is judged

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,250
to be sufficiently small.

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,070
It will usually be impossible to bring the gap to 0,

31
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,550
because a simplified model can't capture all of the factors that

32
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,630
affect market values.

33
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,560
In that case, it makes sense to put more weight

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,110
on matching prices of securities or derivatives

35
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,670
that are most similar to the ones

36
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,320
that the model will be used to price.

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,190


38
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,800
Let's go through an illustration of this sort of calibration

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,120
exercise.

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,790
It's based on a simple modeling approach that

41
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,830
was suggested by Frank Fabozzi.

42
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,480
Imagine that the current term structure

43
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,430
of interest rates or the yield curve

44
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,860
is given by the rates shown here.

45
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,280
The table also shows the implied one-year forward rates.

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,010
You should verify that the implied forward rates are

47
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,900
consistent with the spot rates.

48
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:08,820
For example, 1.035 compounded with 1.04523

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:15,810
is the same as 1.0401 squared.

50
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,500
All of these rates are simple annual percentage rates

51
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,870
like the ones we've been using.

52
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,580
With this term structure, a two-year 4% coupon bond prices

53
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,890
at par, as does a three-year 4.5% coupon bond.

54
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,620


55
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,230
Our goal now is to construct a three-year interest rate

56
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,810
tree that produces bond prices that

57
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,880
are consistent with the yield data we just looked

58
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,370
at and also with an estimate of the percentage

59
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,980
volatility of the one-year rate.

60
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,852
Because we have more free variables

61
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:52,060
and we'll need to match the reference data that we're

62
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,700
using in this example, for convenience,

63
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,410
we'll fix the risk neutral probability

64
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,460
of an up move at 0.5.

65
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,470
Note that other models would assign

66
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,510
the risk neutral probabilities and the values

67
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,200
that each node differently.

68
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,260
What we're looking at is just one possibility.

69
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,420
Assume that recent historical data

70
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,900
implies a volatility of 0.1 estimated

71
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,540
on a continuous annual basis.

72
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,120
A standard way to implement that volatility

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,060
is to assume a two-standard-deviation vertical

74
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,880
distance between nodes at a point in time.

75
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,440
Then starting at RL on the tree that's pictured here,

76
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,450
RH is found by multiplying RL times e

77
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,170
to the 2 times the standard deviation, sigma.

78
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,750
To put numbers on it, if RL is 4.074,

79
00:03:47,750 --> 00:04:00,120
then our H is 4.074 times e to the 2 times 0.1, or 4.976.

80
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,250
Given all of these assumptions, we're

81
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,280
left with the binomial tree in one-year rates

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,280
with only one free variable at each time step.

83
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,160


84
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,690
That free variable is the lowest node at each year.

85
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,880
The nodes above it are determined

86
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,985
by the two standard deviations spacing that we've assumed.

87
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:23,950


88
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,730
We also know R0 from the current one year rate.

89
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,530
We'll find the remaining values of the free rates R1 and R2

90
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:40,440
by iterating until this model prices bonds correctly.

91
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,570
Starting with a two-period case, we

92
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,350
take R0 equals 3.5%, reading it off

93
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,570
of the current term structure.

94
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,270
Let's guess that RL is 4.5%.

95
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:57,210
Then given our assumption of sigma equal to 0.1,

96
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:06,230
RH is 4.5 times e to the 2 times 0.1, or 5.496.

97
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,320
You may wonder why I chose in RL that's greater

98
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,550
than R0, the lower node.

99
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,490
The reason is that in the reference rates

100
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,540
we're trying to match the yield curve is upward sloping.

101
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,330
That initial guess of 4.5% is actually

102
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,670
less than the implied forward rate for that same time period,

103
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:31,370
which was calculated at 4.523%.

104
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,710
We can now use the first two periods of our guess

105
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,330
for the tree to price a two-year of 4% coupon bond.

106
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:46,660
So our tree was 3.5% going to 4.5%, or 5.496.

107
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,020
That procedure for pricing that two-year bond is shown here.

108
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:57,082
And it implies a price for the bond of 99.567.

109
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:59,290
Clearly, there's something wrong with the assumptions

110
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,490
I've made here.

111
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,170
To be consistent with the yield curve,

112
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,470
the bond must price at 100 its par value.

113
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,050
But the model suggests its price is 99.567.

114
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,630
Using the degree of freedom that we've

115
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,200
allowed ourselves, which is to vary R1, the interest

116
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,270
rate at the bottom node, we can look

117
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,110
for a value that generates the correct price for the bond.

118
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,260
For the implied bond price to be higher, clearly,

119
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,270
R1 needs to be lower.

120
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,550
Iterating on the choice of R1, you

121
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,180
can verify that setting it to 4.074

122
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,760
causes the tree to correctly price the two-year 4% coupon

123
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,260
bond.

124
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,910


125
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,860
To extend the tree out another year,

126
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,920
we want to choose the lowest node on the tree, R2,

127
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,250
to match the known price of a three-year bond.

128
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,070
We do this holding R0 and R1 fixed

129
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,580
so that the model will continue to correctly price

130
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,070
one and two-year bonds.

131
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,610
This process is automated in an Excel spreadsheet

132
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,560
that you can download from the class materials

133
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,930
page called TreeFitterMM.xls.

134
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,700


135
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,450
It's programmed in Visual Basic to create a binomial tree

136
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,870
that's consistent with the set of input prices for zero coupon

137
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,400
bonds, which represents the yield curve.

138
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,050
It can create a tree that's actually

139
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,570
more general than the one we've been looking at,

140
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,120
because it accommodates different volatility

141
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,730
assumption for each time step.

142
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,270
That allows you to incorporating time varying volatility

143
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,170
into the model, which is also referred to as the term

144
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,210
structure of volatility.

145
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,660
For instance, if volatility is temporarily elevated,

146
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,080
but expected to return to normal levels at a future time,

147
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,440
that can be reflected in the volatility structure

148
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,800
that you input.

149
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,050
The spreadsheet also allows for the tree

150
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,120
to be calibrated from the implied

151
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,870
volatilities from inputting options price data.

152
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,200
In that mode, which you won't be asked to use

153
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,480
but that you may be curious about,

154
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,890
the implied volatilities replace the assumed volatilities.

155
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,020
Speaking of implied volatilities,

156
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,360
this slide is a reminder that it's always

157
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,580
possible to convert an options pricing

158
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,790
model into a model that's used to estimate implied

159
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,380
volatilities.

160
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,690
That's true of binomial tree models

161
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,930
as well as for analytical models such as Black's model.

162
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,710
A typical options pricing model, whatever the underlying asset

163
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,250
that the option is written on, includes an assumption

164
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,240
about the volatility of that underlying variable.

165
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,049
In the case of models based on interest rates,

166
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,500
it's the volatility of those rates.

167
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,460
The assumption about volatility combined with the other inputs

168
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,920
and entered into a pricing model generates a theoretical options

169
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,040
price as an output.

170
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,660
By taking the same model, but inputting observed options

171
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:12,100
prices instead of volatilities, the output

172
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,872
will give you an implied volatility.

173
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:16,372
