00:00:01,612 --> 00:00:03,570
INSTRUCTOR: Options on floating rate securities

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,040
include caps, collars, and floors.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,340
floating rate securities expose borrowers and lenders

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,950
to uncertainty about the interest rate payments

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,660
they'll have to make in the future

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,110
or that they will receive.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,160
An interest rate cap limits the maximum rate that will be paid.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,710
An interest rate floor limits the minimum rate

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,540
that will be paid.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,410
And an interest rate collar puts both an upper and lower bound

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,660
on the rate that will be paid.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,420
That makes a collar a portfolio that

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,450
contains a long cap and a short floor

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,780
from the perspective of a borrower.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,850
These sorts of provisions are often

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,620
embedded in loan contracts.

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,650
For example, variable rate mortgages

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,020
often have a yearly and lifetime cap

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,890
on the amount by which the rate paid can increase.

20
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,000
In such cases, the interest rate set in the loan contract

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,640
reflects the value of the various provisions.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,010
Caps and floors can also be purchased

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,280
in the over-the-counter market for an upfront fee

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,040
based on some amount of notional principal

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,800
but independent of any particular loan.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,770
Because the methods used to value caps and floors

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,940
are similar, we'll just focus on caps.

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,130
Typically, a floating rate security

29
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,110
is tied to a common reference rate,

30
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,830
like LIBOR or a short-term Treasury rate, or SOFR.

31
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,050
There is also often a fixed spread

32
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,330
that's paid on top of the floating rate.

33
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,290


34
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,540
An interest rate cap is often described

35
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,120
as a strip of call options on a variable interest rate.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,040
The separate elements of the cap,

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,280
one for each interval between interest rate resets,

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,410
are called caplets.

39
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,190
The payoff on a cap depends on the underlying principal,

40
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,490
the period length, and the difference between the floating

41
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,210
rate at time t, called R sub t, which

42
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,970
is based on the index plus any spread,

43
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,970
and the cap rate, R sub x.

44
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,690
As written here, the rates are given as annual percentage

45
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,830
rates.

46
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,280
For example, say you take out a 3-year floating rate

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,570
loan with a principal of $100,000 and an interest rate

48
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,040
that's paid semiannually and linked to six-month LIBOR plus

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,810
50 basis points.

50
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,530
The rate resets every six months, and it's capped at 7%.

51
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,180


52
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,280
To explain the timing convention,

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,520
the interest payment at the end of the first six months

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,120
is based on the six-month LIBOR rate observed in the market

55
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,310
on the loan origination date.

56
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,190
And then the rate paid at the end of the first year

57
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,270
is based on the six-month LIBOR rate in the market six months

58
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,540
after you took out the loan, and so forth.

59
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,120
For the cap, then, its payout at the end

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,570
of each six-month period is the $100,000

61
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:11,110
of principal times the time between resets

62
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:17,130
of half a year times the maximum of the savings

63
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,310
from the cap based on how much the interest

64
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,530
rate is above the 7% cap and 0.

65
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,150
You can see from this diagram why

66
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,690
the payoff looks like a call option on the variable interest

67
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,050
rate.

68
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,820
You can also think of the payoff in opportunity cost terms

69
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,340
as the amount of interest that you avoid

70
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,400
paying because of the cap.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,370
A cap can be priced on a binomial tree, where the step

72
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,520
length corresponds to the time period between interest rate

73
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,750
resets.

74
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,050
Let's look at an example that uses the same one-year interest

75
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,480
rate tree and risk-neutral probabilities

76
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,000
that we've been working with.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,230
Consider a three-year loan with principal value $100,000

78
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,830
that's indexed to the one-year rates represented in this tree.

79
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,930
We want to know what's the value of a 4.75% rate cap.

80
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,000
The nodes here that are circled are

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,100
those at which cap will be in the money

82
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,720
because the rate exceeds the cap rate of 4.75%.

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,340
So at time 1, the cap is effective on the up node

84
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,760
and at time 2, it's operative at the up-up and at the up-down.

85
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,970


86
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,120
Therefore, there are two caplets with positive values.

87
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,690
It's important to be careful about the timing here.

88
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,210
The interest rate is always paid one year after the rate is set,

89
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,410
so the benefit is discounted back an additional year.

90
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,630
For example, the cap set at time 1

91
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,900
affects the interest payment made at time 2.

92
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,890
The calculations shown here are equivalent to working backwards

93
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,370
on the tree in the usual way, discounting the two

94
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,470
possible outcomes of the next period

95
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,530
by the current one-period rate.

96
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,360
Here, though, all that discounting

97
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,030
is collapsed into a single equation.

98
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,980
You can verify that the answer is

99
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,600
the same as with the longer-form calculations.

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,630
Well, similarly, the value of the second caplet,

101
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,430
which has a positive payoff on the top and middle nodes

102
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,690
at time 2, is found to be $775.

103
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,720
Notice that although the tree is recombining and interest rates,

104
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,870
the present value of the protection

105
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,280
on the up-down and down-up node is different

106
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,270
because you're using different interest rates for discounting.

107
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,520
The bottom line is that the value of the cap

108
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,180
is the sum of the value of the two caplets, which totals $879.

109
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,418
