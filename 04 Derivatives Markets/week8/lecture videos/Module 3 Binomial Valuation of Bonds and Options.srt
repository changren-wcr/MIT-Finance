1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,540
PROFESSOR: We're about to embark on an extended example of how

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,780
to value risk-free bonds with embedded options using

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,760
binomial trees.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,430
Our preliminary observation is that bonds

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,000
with embedded options can be decomposed into their component

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,200
parts.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,220
By no arbitrage, the value of a callable bond

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,740
must be equal to the value of the underlying

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,370
non-callable bond, which is also called a straight bond,

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,590
less the value of the call option.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,720
The call option reduces the bond's value

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,420
because it's to the advantage of the bond issuer,

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,450
causing bond buyers to pay less for the bond.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,060
Similarly, the value of a puttable bond

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,020
is the value of the underlying straight bond plus the value

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,490
of the put option.

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,010
In that case, the bond is worth more,

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,460
because the put is a benefit to the bond buyer.

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,860
In general, we'd like our model of interest rates

20
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,130
to accurately price both the option-free bond

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,560
and the embedded options attached to it.

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,690
In this example we'll be looking at,

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,900
we'll use a binomial model to first price the bond

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,600
and the call option separately, and then

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,850
infer the value of the callable bond from the two pieces.

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,510
The two-step binomial tree shown here in one-year rates

27
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,040
with a risk-neutral probability of an up move of 0.5

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,590
will be the basis for pricing bonds and options

29
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,400
in the examples we'll look at.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,050
Notice that at a time t node, the rates in the tree

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,850
are always used to discount cash flows arriving at time t + 1

32
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,920
back to time t.

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,050
Thus, this tree will be used to price bonds

34
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,160
with maturities of one, two, and three years.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,180
We'll first focus on how to value bonds and options taking

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,650
the tree as given.

37
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,540
After that, we'll turn to how it was

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,160
calibrated using market data.

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,050


40
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,480
We'll begin by using the tree to estimate the value of a 5.25%

41
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,600
coupon bond, making annual coupon payments

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,820
with no embedded options.

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,150
Starting at time t, the bond will always

44
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,520
pay off its principal value of 100

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:20,670
plus the final coupon of 5.25.

46
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,000
The value, V, then at each time two node

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,180
is found by discounting the expected value of 105.25

48
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,420
backed by the one-year interest rate at that node.

49
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:41,230
The value of 95.58 at the time two up-up node, for instance,

50
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,180
is discounting that payment of 105.25

51
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,740
back at the rate of 6.757.

52
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,110
Note that the values on the year 2 nodes

53
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,680
represent the remaining value after the year two

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,740
coupon has already been paid.

55
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,550
Now, to find the value at each time one node,

56
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,520
the risk-neutral expectation of the time two value

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,900
plus the time two coupon is discounted back to time one

58
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,080
at the time one interest rate.

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,860
The value on the time one down node, for instance,

60
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,030
is based on the expected value plus a coupon payment at time

61
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:31,160
two on the down-up node and on the down-down node discounted

62
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,900
at the time one interest rate of 4.074.

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,350
Continuing in this way all the way back to time zero

64
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:47,560
gives a value for the bond of 102.075.

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,320
A few observations here.

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,230
It's clear we didn't need a binomial model to estimate

67
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,660
the value of a risk-free bond with no embedded options --

68
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,810
we could have estimated its value directly

69
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,230
from the yield curve or equivalently from the prices

70
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,190
of comparable bonds.

71
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,730
However, we will need the tree to value bonds

72
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,800
with embedded options and, if we want

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,320
to have confidence in our tree as a pricing tool,

74
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,240
we want to be able to demonstrate

75
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,370
that the bond prices that it generates

76
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,410
are consistent with the yield curve.

77
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,000
We'll come back to this later, when

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,560
we discuss how to calibrate the tree in the first place.

79
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,550
Now, imagine the same bond is callable by the issuer

80
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,000
at the end of the second year, after the year two coupon has

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,760
been paid at a strike price of 99.50.

82
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,280
We can use the tree to value that call option,

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,290
again working backwards.

84
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,400
Comparing the 99.50 strike price with the values we found a time

85
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,810
two on each node, the call is out of the money on the up-up

86
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,010
node.

87
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:56,130
It's in the money by 0.232 on the up-down or down-up node,

88
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,660
and in the money by 1.19 on the down-down node.

89
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,830


90
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,860
Notice that when using interest rate trees instead of price

91
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,850
trees, the calls have greater value on the lower branches,

92
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,960
because lower rates translate into higher bond values

93
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,000
and conversely for puts.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,600
We can discount those payoffs working backwards on the tree

95
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,300
and at each node using the one-year rate on that node

96
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,920
for discounting.

97
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,090
For instance, at the time one up node, the value of the call

98
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,010
is 0.11 based on a probability of 0.5

99
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,560
that it will be worth 0.232 next period and a probability of 0.5

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,340
that it will be worth nothing and discounting that expected

101
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:56,362
value by 4.976%

102
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:58,840
Continuing again back to time zero,

103
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:06,140
we estimate that the value of the European call is 0.383.

104
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,910
Because the value of the call reduces

105
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,410
the value of the bond to the lender

106
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,630
by the value of the call option, we

107
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,180
estimate the value of the callable bond

108
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,250
as the value of the straight bond

109
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:24,530
minus the value of the call option which comes to 101.692.

110
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,990
The fact that embedded options affect bond prices

111
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,210
means they also affect yields.

112
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,680
Remember that the yield on a bond

113
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,630
is based on finding the single discount

114
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,560
rate that equates its price with its promised payments.

115
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,940
On the three-year 5.25% coupon bond with no embedded options,

116
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,770
our model implies that it would have a yield of 4.495

117
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,770
based on this equation here and solving for y.

118
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,850
When it's callable, because the price is lower,

119
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:01,634
the implied yield is higher at 4.633%.

120
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:04,040
This difference can loosely be described

121
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,060
as the issuer paying about 14 basis points for the call

122
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,390
option.

123
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,980
The final note here is that you may see the term

124
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,660
option-adjusted spread.

125
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,060
That describes an adjustment that's sometimes

126
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,510
made to yields that removes the effect of embedded put and call

127
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,410
options.

128
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,230
That sort of adjustment is used in creating indices

129
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,750
of bond yields, such as for corporate bonds

130
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,290
with triple B credit ratings.

131
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,000
