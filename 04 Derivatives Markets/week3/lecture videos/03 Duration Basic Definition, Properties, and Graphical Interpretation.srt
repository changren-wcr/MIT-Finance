1
00:00:00,593 --> 00:00:02,260
PROFESSOR: With all of that for context,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,670
we're ready to turn to some of the most frequently used

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,680
duration measures.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,160
The oldest measure of duration, known as Macaulay Duration

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,520
after the man who invented it, represents the elasticity

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,309
of a bond price with respect to its yield.

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,310
In economics and finance, an elasticity

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,310
is the percentage change in one variable--

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,180
in this case, the price of a bond or a portfolio of bonds

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,930
with respect to the percentage change in a second variable;

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,140
in this case, the yield to maturity.

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,270
Notice that the expression here is multiplied by a minus sign.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,440
That's in order to define the duration as a positive quantity

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,440
when the derivative of price with respect to yield

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,250
is negative, as is typical for bond prices, which

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,120
move inversely to yields.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,490
This equation represents the idea

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,670
in terms of derivatives of bond price with respect

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,920
to its yield, normalized by this expression

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,440
on the right-hand side, which puts

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,810
everything in percentage terms.

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,300
That is, we have the percentage change in price with respect

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,560
to the percentage change in yield.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,430
Because a bond's price sensitivity changes over time

25
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,510
as its remaining maturity shrinks

26
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,200
and as market interest rate conditions change,

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,690
duration is a property of a bond or portfolio,

28
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,330
the point in time.

29
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,920
And it changes over time.

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,060
Now, Macaulay applied this to our familiar equation

31
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,570
for the price of a bond as the present discounted value

32
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,210
of its promised cash flows by taking

33
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,450
the derivative with respect to the yield to maturity.

34
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,370
The result of Macaulay's calculation

35
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,740
is the top formula here.

36
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,430
To explain the notation briefly, the yield Y

37
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,640
is stated as an annual percentage rate and k

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,370
is the number of assumed compounding periods per year.

39
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,800
The total number of periods, capital T, when divided by k,

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,740
gives the life of the bond in years.

41
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,020
This representation allows for bonds

42
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,590
with payments on a daily, monthly, quarterly, annual,

43
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,600
and so forth basis.

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,760
The derivation of the formula is optional for you

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,580
but it's included in the appendix

46
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,970
section of these slides in case you want to take a look.

47
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,930
Now, the top formula can be rewritten to a more intuitively

48
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,580
interpretable form.

49
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,970
That's in this highlighted equation here.

50
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,300
It says that the Macaulay Duration turns out

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,540
to be a weighted average of the arrival time of the promised

52
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,530
cash flows, where the weights are present value weights.

53
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,440
That is, the present value of cash flows

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,930
arriving at a point in time divided

55
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,890
by the total present value or price of the bond

56
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,550
So here, we have the fraction of the present value arriving

57
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,290
in the first period, the fraction

58
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,720
arriving in the second period, and so

59
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,680
forth of the last period, each waiting

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,065
their respective arrival time.

61
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:19,140


62
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,680
Let's now reconsider the four bonds we looked at

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,110
to compare their price sensitivity to interest rate

64
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,020
changes in Example 3.1.

65
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,990
We can calculate the Macaulay Duration for each of them.

66
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,225
Since duration is a measure of price sensitivity

67
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:36,210
to yield changes, we'd expect the durations

68
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,360
to have the same ordering as the price sensitivities

69
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,480
we found when we recomputed the prices following a yield

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,130
change in the original example.

71
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,980
If you look back at that, you'll see

72
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,320
that's exactly what we find.

73
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,050
This is a good time to introduce you to a handy spreadsheet tool

74
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,480
on the class web page that allows you to calculate

75
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,790
durations and convexity for a coupon

76
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,960
bond with either an annual or semi-annual coupon payment.

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,810
It's called duration and convexity calculator.

78
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,820
You might want to open it and follow along

79
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,600
as we go through this example.

80
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,120
Let's take the first bond.

81
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,450
That has a 9% annual coupon with semi-annual payments.

82
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,350
So 4.5% of the face value is paid every 6 months.

83
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,750
Its maturity is 5 years, and it's

84
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,810
priced to yield 9% on a bond equivalent basis, which

85
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,760
means the discount rate is also taken

86
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,700
to be semi-annual at 4.5%.

87
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,920
Enter this information into the spreadsheet,

88
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,690
and then hit Duration to get the Macaulay Duration.

89
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,960
So we have a maturity of 5 years.

90
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,660


91
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,080
2 represents the semi-annual compounding opportunities.

92
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,650
The coupon rate is 9%.

93
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,780
We never need to change the face value.

94
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,850
And we have the yield at 9%.

95
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:03,010
Hitting Duration, we find a Macaulay Duration of 4.134.

96
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,690
You can see this spreadsheet also

97
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,690
calculates modified duration and convexity, which

98
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,490
we'll return to shortly.

99
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,920
To get the convexity, you also need

100
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,860
to hit the Convexity button, which for this bond,

101
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,490
turns out to be 19.45.

102
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,620
I also want to use the Macaulay Duration

103
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,010
formula to go back and provide a more intuitive understanding

104
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,890
of what drives the price sensitivity of coupon bonds

105
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,130
that don't contain options, such as default or prepayment

106
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,820
options.

107
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,520
The formula says that the duration

108
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,910
is a present value weighted average of cash flow arrival

109
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,530
times.

110
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,240
Again, here k is a number of payments per year.

111
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,000
And capital T is the number of periods.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,350
For example, if T equals 2 and k equals 4,

113
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,490
there's a cash flow every quarter for 2 years.

114
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,550
Clearly, the duration must be less than or equal to the time

115
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,880
to maturity since no cash flows arrive after maturity.

116
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,730
The maximum duration is the maturity,

117
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,640
and that will be the case for a zero coupon bond

118
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,080
where 100% of the cash flows arrive on the maturity date.

119
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,780
All else equal, a higher coupon rate

120
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,030
reduces the duration, because it causes

121
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,710
a higher percentage of the total cash flows to arrive earlier.

122
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,310
Finally, the effect of higher market yields

123
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,250
is also via the present value weights.

124
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,640
As market yields increase, the present value

125
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,060
of the more distant payments gets smaller relative

126
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,880
to the value of the payments arriving sooner.

127
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,150
That puts a higher proportion of the total present value

128
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,700
on the earlier payments, pulling down

129
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,310
the weighted average arrival time of the cash flows

130
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,570
and shortening the duration.

131
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,490


132
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,250
Going back to the more general representation of Macaulay

133
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,380
Duration on slide 12 --

134
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,420
it's also copied here, --

135
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,900
this formula can be rearranged to express the percentage

136
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,110
change in the price of a bond as the product

137
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,780
of minus its duration and the change

138
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,280
in its yield normalized by the factor 1 over 1 plus Y over k.

139
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,220


140
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,500
Because we use this formula so often,

141
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,010
it's convenient to roll up that normalization factor

142
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,410
into the duration measure itself.

143
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,740
That duration measure is called modified duration.

144
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,310
With this definition, we now have a very simple formula

145
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,200
to approximate the percentage price

146
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,590
change of a bond when there's a small change in its yield.

147
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,160
It's simply the modified duration multiplied

148
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,630
by that change in the yield.

149
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,680


150
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,900
Some version of this equation is the basis

151
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,300
for all duration-based hedging strategies

152
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,600
for fixed income securities and their related derivatives.

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,710


154
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,620
Let's see how while this duration-based approximation

155
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,890
works by looking at an example.

156
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,080
As you can check with the duration and convexity

157
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,250
calculator, a 20-year 5% coupon bond

158
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,500
with semi-annual coupon payments that's priced to yield 9%

159
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,210
has a modified duration of 10.4.

160
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,870
The predicted price change, if yields increase

161
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:31,080
from the 9% to 9.1%, according to the duration approximation

162
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,000
formula, is minus the modified duration

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,860
times the change in yield, which gives us an approximate price

164
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,860
change of minus 1.04%.

165
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,350
The actual price change can be found

166
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,930
by recalculating the price of the bond,

167
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:57,490
assuming a discount rate of 9.1% in place of the original 9%.

168
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,620
The actual price change is minus 1.03%.

169
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,980
The approximation is very accurate in this case.

170
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,710
Now let's consider a large yield change from 9% to 11%.

171
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,760
In that case, the duration approximation formula

172
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,740
implies a fall in price of 20.8%.

173
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,980
Again calculating the actual price change,

174
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,650
the price only drops by 17.94%.

175
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,330
We can see that with this large yield change,

176
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,310
the approximation is quite poor.

177
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,250
A general conclusion is that approximations

178
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,220
to price changes based just on duration

179
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,420
work well when there are small changes in yields, but not so

180
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,120
well for larger changes.

181
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,920
This will matter for the effectiveness

182
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,720
of hedging strategies.

183
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,050
Duration-based hedges only offer good protection

184
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,510
if rate changes are modest and they

185
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,710
have to be adjusted over time as yields change.

186
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,160
A useful way to understand why a duration-based approximation

187
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,550
of price changes works well for small changes in yields

188
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,830
is to look at the relationship between the price

189
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,690
and yield graphically.

190
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,530
This diagram plots price against yield for a typical bond.

191
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,560
It's labeled to the actual price curve

192
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,430
and has the characteristic shape that we saw before.

193
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,725
As yields rise, price declines but at a decreasing rate.

194
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:36,420


195
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,360
We know the duration is related to the derivative of the bond

196
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,180
price with respect to its yield.

197
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,720
Graphically, that means that it's related to the slope

198
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,660
of the tangent line to the actual price curve

199
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,390
at the current yield, which is denoted by Y*.

200
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:58,950


201
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,730
The duration approximation of the price change

202
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,610
slides up or down that tangent line.

203
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,360
For small changes in yield, the actual price change

204
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,030
gets close to the tangent line approximation.

205
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,980


206
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,740
For a large change in yield, there's

207
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,160
a large gap between the tangent line and the actual price

208
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,550
curve, and the approximation is inaccurate.

209
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:34,930


210
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,330
Notice too that the slope of the tangent line,

211
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,860
and hence the bond's duration, changes with the yield --

212
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,680
as the yield gets higher, the line flattens.

213
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,500


214
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,570
A flatter slope means shorter duration.

215
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,380


216
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,340
Finally, what about the duration of a short position?

217
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,950
We know that a short position flips the sign

218
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,900
of all of the cash flows.

219
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,120
That flipped the actual price curve

220
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,510
over the x-axis in this diagram, and flipped

221
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,090
the side of the tangent line.

222
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,440
For example, a bond that, in a long position,

223
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,570
has a duration of 4 years, has a duration of minus 4 years

224
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,920
from the perspective of a short position.

225
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,780
A good exercise is for you to try

226
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,480
drawing the graph for the short position that

227
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,310
corresponds to this graph for a long position.

228
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,000
