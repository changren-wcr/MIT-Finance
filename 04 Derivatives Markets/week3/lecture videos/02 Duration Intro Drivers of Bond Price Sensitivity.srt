00:00:01,453 --> 00:00:03,370
PROFESSOR: Before digging into the definitions

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,322
and interpretations of duration and convexity,

3
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:08,780
it's important to take another look

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,080
at the more general equation relating the price of a bond

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,870
with multiple cash flows to its yield to maturity.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,730
The yield to maturity is the single interest rate

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,090
that equates the price of the bond

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,850
to the present value of its promised payments.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:37,420


10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,070
The price and the yield to maturity

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,080
contain the same information.

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,260
Given one and the cash flows, you can solve for the other.

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,090
There are built-in functions in Excel to do these calculations.

14
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,030
Two that are very useful for coupon bonds

15
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,890
are the PV function and the Rate function.

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,100
Both are well-documented in Excel.

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,590
I've posted a sample spreadsheet that

18
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,890
illustrates the use of these and related functions.

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,580
A few things to note.

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,350
First, the relationship between the price of a coupon bond

21
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,460
and its yield to maturity is a convex function.

22
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,800
When we look at duration and convexity,

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,975
we'll often plot price against yield in a graph like this.

24
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:35,590


25
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,250
The yield to maturity abstracts from the spot yield

26
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,840
curve, which has more precise information about market rates.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,880
Remember that to find the yield to maturity,

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,230
we apply a single discount rate to all future cash

29
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,210
flows regardless of their arrival time.

30
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,420
By contrast, the spot yield curve

31
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,220
captures the fact that the market

32
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,500
assigns a potentially different discount

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,950
rate to cash flows arriving at every different maturity.

34
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,280
You should think of the bond prices observed in markets

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,570
as reflecting the more detailed information in the spot yield

36
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,770
curve.

37
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,780
That has to be true or else there

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,270
would be an arbitrage opportunity.

39
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,270
However, the yield to maturity is an approximation

40
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,470
that's useful in its simplicity of having only one dimension.

41
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,960
Most of the duration and convexity measures

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,540
we will focus on do use this yield

43
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,690
to maturity approximation as a relevant rate.

44
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,730
However, there are some duration and convexity concepts,

45
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,150
notably, Fisher-Weil and key rate durations,

46
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,280
that take into account the complexity of the spot yield

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,780
curve.

48
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,820


49
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,660
Duration and convexity together answer the question,

50
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,050
approximately how much will a security's price change

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,460
for a small change in its yield?

52
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,950
In very general terms, you can think

53
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,580
of the price of any interest sensitive security

54
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,290
as a function of its yield and other characteristics that

55
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,810
affect its price, like its liquidity,

56
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,860
any embedded options, default risk, and so forth.

57
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,430
We'll let f represent this function

58
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,505
without being specific about the form that it takes.

59
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:29,680


60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,200
Duration measures are all related

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,220
to the first partial derivative of the price with respect

62
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,370
to yield, answering the question, what's

63
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,940
the first order effect on price of a small change in yield?

64
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,490
Convexity measures are all related

65
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,578
to the second derivative of the price with respect

66
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:51,120
to the yield.

67
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,670


68
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,730
Importantly, these metrics apply not only

69
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,380
to bonds and other fixed income securities,

70
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,440
but also, to derivative contracts

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,430
like interest rate, swaps, and futures that are also

72
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,680
interest rate sensitive.

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,680
Understanding duration and convexity in this way

74
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,490
is directly relevant to the risk management strategies

75
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,010
based on these metrics.

76
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,740
There are three main factors that affect the bond or bond

77
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,040
portfolio's price sensitivity to yield changes:

78
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,750
remaining maturity, coupon rate, and the general level

79
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,690
of market interest rates.

80
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,350
Duration increases with maturity and it

81
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,155
decreases with coupon rates and the level of market interest

82
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:37,655
rates.

83
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:40,380


84
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,960
This example provides a quantitative sense

85
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,950
of the relative importance of maturity and coupon rates

86
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,610
on price sensitivity.

87
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,120
It's based on comparisons of four bonds,

88
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,450
two with maturities of 20 years, and two

89
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,940
with maturities of five years.

90
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,920
For each maturity, there are two bonds,

91
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,180
one with a coupon rate at 9%, and two

92
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,460
with a coupon rate of 5%.

93
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,500
It's assumed that each are originally priced to yield 9%.

94
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,850
The table shows, for a range of decreases and increases

95
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,490
in the market yield, the percentage

96
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,860
change in the price of the bond relative to its price

97
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,940
when yields are at 9%.

98
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,890
Each row of the table represents a particular yield change.

99
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,900
For example, the highlighted row shows the percentage price

100
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:47,340
change for each bond when rates go from 9% down to 8%.

101
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,880
Comparing across maturities, we can

102
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,560
see that the percentage price increase is much larger

103
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,690
for the 20-year bonds than for the five-year bonds, holding

104
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,430
coupon rates fixed in each case.

105
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,690
Now, comparing across coupon rates,

106
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,430
the percentage price increase is smaller for the higher coupon

107
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,950
rate bond holding maturities fixed.

108
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,100
Both of these regularities are true in general,

109
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,230
although the magnitudes will vary

110
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,360
with the bond characteristics and with market rates.

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,230
Notice, too, that the changes are not symmetric, say,

112
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,350
for a 1% increase in rates versus a 1% decrease.

113
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,200
The larger absolute magnitude of the changes when

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,330
rates fall than when they rise, all else equal,

115
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,690
is related to the positive convexity of the bonds.

116
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,270
We'll confirm that shortly.

117
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,870
If you'd like to see how this example was calculated,

118
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,820
the Excel file I'm showing here has the calculations embedded

119
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,902
and you can download it and take a look.

120
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:03,402
