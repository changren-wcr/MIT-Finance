1
00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:03,480
SPEAKER: You've now learned the basics about duration

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,580
but because the concept is so important

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,070
in fixed income risk management strategies,

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,140
I want to also briefly introduce you

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,060
to some related and more general duration measures that are

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,090
practitioners often rely on.

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,810


8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,780
In many applications such as choosing the right size

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,360
for a hedge position, the focus is

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,640
on the dollar size of a price change

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,440
rather than on the percentage change.

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,400
To do this, we rearrange our previous formula

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,550
for the approximate percentage price change based on

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,730
modified duration to get the approximate dollar price

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,230
change.

16
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,160


17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,390
To make calculations using this formula even simpler,

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,710
we introduced the notion of $1 duration.

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,770
Dollar duration is the modified duration

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,510
multiplied by the price.

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,090


22
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,810
With that definition, we can approximate the change

23
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:10,000
in the dollar price of a bond or bond portfolio using

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,290
the product of the dollar duration times the change

25
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:20,760
in yield, and importantly multiplying it by a minus sign.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,530
The concept of dollar duration is

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,010
especially important in evaluating risk in a 0 NPV

28
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,290
fixed income portfolio.

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,980
One where the present value of a long and short position

30
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,540
are equal.

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,990
An example of this is for an interest rate swap or futures

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,880
contract, which we know initially always has a 0 NPV

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,240
and that we saw was equivalent to holding

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,770
a portfolio with a combination of long and short positions.

35
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,620
Clearly, it isn't possible to talk about the percentage

36
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,800
change in the value of a 0 NPV portfolio

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,060
because that would require dividing by 0,

38
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,280
but the value of the long and short positions

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,120
will change differentially when rates change and the dollar

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,090
price change in the portfolio can be approximated

41
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,020
with dollar duration.

42
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,930


43
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,440
I've primarily been emphasizing duration for a single bond

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,300
but often it's useful to work with the consolidated duration

45
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,730
for a portfolio consisting of many bonds.

46
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,640
Calculating the duration of a bond portfolio

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,690
is straightforward.

48
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,050
The modified duration of a bond portfolio

49
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,740
is the value weighted average of the modified duration

50
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,590
of the bonds in the portfolio.

51
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,290
A simple example of this is at the bottom of the slide.

52
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,690
The dollar duration of a bond portfolio

53
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,930
is simply the sum of the individual dollar durations

54
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,450
of the portfolio components.

55
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,780
Later, we'll see that a portfolio's duration can also

56
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,080
be changed using derivatives contracts.

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,510
So far, we've been working with duration measures

58
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,110
to treat the promised cash flows on a bond or portfolio as

59
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,420
if they're a sure thing but that isn't always the case.

60
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,930
Some bonds are callable or putable

61
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,790
or there may be default risk.

62
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,530
In such cases, these embedded call, put, or default options

63
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,010
affect the price of the bond and also its sensitivity

64
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,750
to yield changes.

65
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,940
A good example is a 30-year mortgage

66
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,320
that's likely to be prepaid over a much shorter horizon,

67
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,660
say maybe over seven years.

68
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,600
Calculating its duration as if payments

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,760
will continue for 30 years will greatly

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,610
overestimate the sensitivity of its value to yield changes.

71
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,560
The most general and most important

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,240
duration concept is that of effective duration.

73
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,630
It was developed to provide an accurate approximation of price

74
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,760
sensitivity to interest rate changes

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,720
even in cases when there's uncertainty about future cash

76
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,310
flows.

77
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,030
Effective duration is an estimate of the true percentage

78
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,680
price sensitivity, taking into account any embedded options.

79
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,340
Unfortunately, there isn't a general formula

80
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,740
you can use to calculate it.

81
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,170
Rather, it's something an analyst has

82
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,600
to estimate based on their best theoretical or empirical model

83
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,250
of how the price will change for small changes in yield.

84
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,050
But here's a general rule, when cash flows are certain,

85
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,940
modified duration is the same thing as effective duration.

86
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,520
When cash flows are uncertain, it's

87
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,800
better to use effective duration when it's available.

88
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,430
Finally, there are generalized notions of duration

89
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,830
that recognize that a bond's price is not only

90
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,130
sensitive to its yield to maturity but potentially

91
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,380
also to other factors.

92
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,140
Those could include inflation, stock prices,

93
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,140
or changes in yields at particular points

94
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,500
along the yield curve.

95
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,890
The sensitivity to any one of those factors

96
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,140
is called a partial duration.

97
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,120
Partial durations are useful when

98
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,640
you want to tailor a hedge so that it protects

99
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,080
against a specific risk, say of changes in 10-year treasury

100
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,910
yields.

101
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,760
We won't go into this further but it's useful

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,950
to be aware of that logic and that it's

103
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,310
very similar to that used in the duration based hedges

104
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,500
that we will look at.

105
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,000
