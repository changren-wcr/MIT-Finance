1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,580
PROFESSOR: It's often more convenient and less

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,610
expensive to execute delta and gamma hedging

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,060
strategies using derivatives rather than taking

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,390
an offsetting position in the cash market.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,310
The logic of hedging with derivatives

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,570
is exactly the same as in the example we just saw.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,530
The interest rate sensitivity of the position being hedged

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:28,090
is offset as closely as possible by creating a derivatives

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,610
position with an offsetting exposure,

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,760
and ideally one where the relative convexity works

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,200
in your favor.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,560
So now all you need to learn to be able to set up an interest

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,370
rate hedge using the sorts of forwards, futures, and swap

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,820
contracts for interest rates that we've discussed

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,780
is how to find the duration and convexity of those contracts.

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,150
For delta and gamma hedging strategies,

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,980
we saw that the relevant duration

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,290
concept is dollar duration.

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,000
It's straightforward to find the dollar

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,819
duration of a forward or futures contract

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,540
where the underlying asset is a bond or a portfolio of fixed

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,250
income securities.

23
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,770
In that case, the dollar duration

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,530
is the product of two terms, first,

25
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,440
the modified or effective duration of the bonds

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,600
specified in the contract and second, the prepaid forward

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,890
or futures price of the bond specified in the contract.

28
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,920
Recall, too, that the prepaid forward or futures

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,290
price is just the present value of the purchase price specified

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,110
in the forward or futures contract.

31
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,500
You'll see a detailed example of how to apply

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,980
this in the recitation.

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,010


34
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,470
This slide summarizes the standard procedure

35
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,560
for using a futures contract for delta hedging interest rate

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,450
risk.

37
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,220
As we've discussed before, futures

38
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,590
are an attractive tool for hedging because

39
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,010
of their high liquidity, low transactions costs,

40
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:08,740
rapid speed of execution, and safety from counterparty risk.

41
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,030
There's relatively few types of fixed income futures contracts

42
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,260
relative to the essentially infinite variety of positions

43
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,870
that traders or financial institutions

44
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,880
might want to hedge.

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,320
Fortunately, with strategies based on hedge ratios,

46
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,990
any mismatch in the underlying durations

47
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,150
of the long or short positions are

48
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,750
compensated for by adjusting the size of the hedge.

49
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,010
The first step, then, is to estimate the price sensitivity

50
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,780
of the exposure you want to hedge

51
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,540
with its hedge ratio, which we know

52
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,130
is the product of minus its value

53
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,410
times its modified or effective duration.

54
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,230
Remember that modified an effective duration

55
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,220
are the same things for bonds with safe cash flows,

56
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,940
but they'll differ when they're embedded options in the bond.

57
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,070
And in that case, effective duration

58
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,960
is the relevant measure you should use.

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,550


60
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,270
The second step is to determine the hedge ratio for the futures

61
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:18,770
contract.

62
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,450


63
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,870
The third step is to take a position in the futures

64
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,980
contracts such that the hedge ratio of the cash position

65
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,740
matches the hedge ratio of the futures position.

66
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,830


67
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,040
If the cash exposure is a net long position,

68
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,910
the futures position will be a short one and vice versa.

69
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,700
Delta hedging strategies also are frequently

70
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,090
executed using interest rate swaps.

71
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,700
To find the dollar duration of an interest rate swap,

72
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,950
we use two facts we've already learned.

73
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,890
The first is that from the perspective of the fixed rate

74
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,150
receiver.

75
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,370
At the inception of the swap, it's

76
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,830
equivalent to a portfolio consisting

77
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,350
of a long position and a fixed rate bond

78
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,830
and a short position at a floating rate bond, both priced

79
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,770
to the identical par value.

80
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,279
The second fact is that the dollar duration of a portfolio

81
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,250
is the sum of the dollar duration of its component

82
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,680
parts.

83
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,690
There's one more fact you need to know,

84
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,540
which is that for a pure floating rate bond,

85
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,000
its effective duration is the time

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,880
until its next reset date divided by 1 over 1

87
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,920
plus y over k.

88
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,650
That's because it was, as we saw last time,

89
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,670
the price on every reset date is fixed at par.

90
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,570
For the fixed rate bond, the modified or effective duration

91
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,990
can be found in the usual way.

92
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,490
Putting these pieces together, for the fixed rate receiver,

93
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,150
the dollar duration of the swap minus the derivative of price

94
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,950
with respect to the yield is equal to the value of the fixed

95
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:11,080
rate side of the swap times its modified or effective duration

96
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,020
minus the current value of the floating

97
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,700
side of the swap times its effective duration.

98
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,300
Of course, the duration of the swap from the floating rate

99
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,150
receiver's perspective is just the negative

100
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,940
what it is for the fixed rate receiver.

101
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,820
Let's apply this approach to a concrete example.

102
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,910
Consider a new five-year interest rate

103
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,150
swap offering a fixed rate quoted

104
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,140
at 6% with semi-annual payments and a floating

105
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,280
rate of six-month LIBOR with a notional principal

106
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,325
of $1 million.

107
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:57,270
Assume that the current six-month LIBOR is also 6%.

108
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,820
So 3% is earned over the next six months.

109
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,000
With this information, we can find the dollar duration

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,740
from the perspective of each counterparty, both

111
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,460
the fixed and floating rate payers.

112
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,640
Using the duration and convexity calculator,

113
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,050
a five-year fixed-rate bond with a 6% coupon that's

114
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,380
paid semi-annually and selling it par

115
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:29,310
has a modified duration of 4.265 years.

116
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,970
The effective duration of the floating rate side

117
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:40,460
is based on the six months till the next reset date divided

118
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,530
by 1 plus y over 2, so divided by 1.03,

119
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:51,110
which gives an effective duration of 0.485 years.

120
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,630
The difference, then, is 3.78 years.

121
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,870
Hence the dollar duration of the swap

122
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,490
from the perspective of the fixed rate receiver

123
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:10,450
is 3.78 times 1 million, or 3.78 million.

124
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,420
The floating rate receiver's position

125
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,630
is just the negative of the fixed rate receiver's position.

126
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:24,170
And so the dollar duration there is minus 3.78 million.

127
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,960
A potential advantage of hedging with swaps

128
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,050
is the wide variety of durations and convexities

129
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,010
that are available.

130
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,260
Importantly, there's liquidity at longer durations

131
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,880
than there is in many other markets.

132
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,430
We've really covered a lot of important ground this week.

133
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,490
Here are some key takeaways.

134
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,950
The imperative for financial institutions

135
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,020
to manage their interest rate risk

136
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,900
has given rise to the largest derivative markets

137
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,470
in the world.

138
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,490
And duration- and convexity-based or delta gamma

139
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,050
approaches are at the core of most of the hedging strategies

140
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,360
that use these instruments.

141
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,610
A big strength of these strategies

142
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,560
is their flexibility.

143
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,380
There are so many ways to achieve a similar amount

144
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,120
of protection from risk.

145
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
We've seen that effective hedges can

146
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,350
be implemented in the cash markets

147
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,990
or with a variety of derivatives.

148
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,090
The choice between the different options

149
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,800
comes down to transactions costs, availability,

150
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,640
and risk tolerance.

151
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,500
To provide some practice setting up

152
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,880
delta hedges with derivatives, in the recitation this week,

153
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,309
you'll revisit the security dealers risk

154
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:44,210
exposure in example 3.5 and go over

155
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,810
how she can hedge it with a bond futures contract

156
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,190
and also using an interest rate swap.
