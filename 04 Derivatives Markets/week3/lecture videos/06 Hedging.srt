1
00:00:00,715 --> 00:00:03,090
INSTRUCTOR: Now that we've covered the basics of duration

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,990
and convexity, I'm here with my friendly hedgehog

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,270
to turn to hedging strategies that

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,730
use duration and convexity.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,840
We'll start by seeing how to set up these hedges using the cash

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,920
markets and then see how to get the same sort of protection,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,290
often at a lower cost, with forwards, futures, and swaps.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,530
We can rearrange the equation introduced on slide 27

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,870
to approximate how much the price of a bond

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,210
will change with a small change in its yield.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,760


12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,820
This equation for the approximate price change

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,010
is the basis for hedging strategies

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,310
known as delta hedging and gamma hedging.

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,800
Because of that, some of the terms in the equation

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,920
are given special names.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,290
The product of duration and price

18
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,930
is often called the hedge ratio.

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,010


20
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,160
Earlier, we called this dollar duration.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,670
They are the same.

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,700
The product of convexity and price is often called gamma.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,970
That's the same thing as dollar convexity.

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,010


25
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,320
Delta hedging in this context refers

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,460
to a hedging strategy based just on first-order price

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,910
sensitivities.

28
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,820
It involves equating the hedge ratio

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,430
of one's assets and liabilities so as

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,100
to neutralize the effects of yield changes

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,640
on the value of an investor's net position.

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,890
Such a portfolio is described as delta neutral.

33
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,910
We saw that duration-based approximation to price changes

34
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,420
is not very accurate for large yield changes.

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,510
From a hedging perspective, that implies

36
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,300
that a delta-neutral portfolio is still

37
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,280
exposed to the risk of large yield changes.

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,950
To further reduce that risk, a portfolio

39
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,180
can be structured to also be gamma neutral.

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,330
A gamma-neutral portfolio is delta neutral,

41
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,010
and it also equates the gammas of the assets and liabilities.

42
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,860
Equating the gammas as well as the hedge ratio

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,490
takes into account the convexity of the price-yield relationship

44
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,240
and provides a more robust hedge.

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,410
This example is one of my favorites.

46
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,770
It's a little more complex than most of the examples

47
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,200
we've looked at until now, but I like it

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
a lot because it clearly illustrates

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,460
how to set up a delta and gamma hedge

50
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,210
and also what are the choices and trade-offs involved

51
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,770
with doing that.

52
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,080
We'll start by setting up the hedge in several ways

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,120
using the cash market, then we'll

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,700
compare the various outcomes to draw some general conclusions.

55
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,530
Consider a dealer in corporate bonds

56
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,510
who finds herself at the end of the trading

57
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,310
day with an inventory of $1 billion

58
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,430
in five-year, 6.9% bonds.

59
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,120
Those bonds are priced at par, and the coupon

60
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,160
is paid semi-annually.

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,620
Over the course of the day, she might have bought or sold

62
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,680
many other bonds, but these particular bonds

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,100
are what's leftover at the day's end.

64
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,130
Well, these corporate bonds are illiquid, and trying

65
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,630
to sell them quickly would entail

66
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,950
a loss that she wants to avoid.

67
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,350
But holding them overnight is risky

68
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,910
because their price could fall if interest rates rise.

69
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,570
An alternative that's cheaper to selling the corporate bonds

70
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,010
is to hedge the risk by instead shorting more liquid Treasury

71
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,820
bonds.

72
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,210
If rates rise, the gain on the Treasury short position

73
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,150
will help offset the loss on the corporate bonds.

74
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,620
The short Treasury position will be sized using a delta or gamma

75
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,770
hedging strategy.

76
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,310
Let's imagine the following liquid treasury bonds are

77
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,080
available for shorting--

78
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:11,080
a 10-year 8% Treasury priced at $1,109

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,180
per $1,000 of face value, or alternatively,

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,360
a three-year 6.3% Treasury priced at $1,008.1

81
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,810
per $1,000 face value.

82
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,300
Well, either of these bonds, and in practice,

83
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,230
many other Treasury bonds, could be used to set up the hedge.

84
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,070
We'll start by calculating how much of the 10-year bond

85
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,200
she would need to short, and then we'll

86
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,180
calculate how much of the three-year bond

87
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,360
she'd need to short using our formula for finding

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,430
a hedge ratio.

89
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,560
Then we'll evaluate the performance

90
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,320
of the hedge in both cases under the assumption

91
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,950
that yields do rise by 1% overnight on all bonds

92
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,060
and that all positions are closed out the next day.

93
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,120
To answer the question in part A about how much to short

94
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,280
and to set up the hedges, we first

95
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,170
need to calculate the modified duration

96
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,410
of the corporate bond holdings and also of the Treasury bonds

97
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,580
that are candidates for shorting.

98
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,920
Plugging the information for each bond

99
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,830
into our duration and convexity calculator

100
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,590
implies that the long corporate bond position has

101
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,850
a modified duration of 4.1688.

102
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,410
The 10-year Treasury has a modified duration of 7.005,

103
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:38,250
and the three-year Treasury has a modified duration of 2.7.

104
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,070
The hedge ratio for the five-year corporate bonds

105
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,970
is their value of $1 million multiplied by their modified

106
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,750
duration of 4.1688, which gives a hedge

107
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,300
ratio of $4.1688 million.

108
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,390
If the 10-year Treasury bond is used to hedge,

109
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,380
the amount shorted is such that the hedge ratio of the Treasury

110
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,590
bond is equated to that of the corporate bond, which

111
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:10,670
means solving for the x in the equation x times 7.005

112
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:18,680
is equal to $4.1688 million.

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,410
We can solve for x to get 593,861,050.

114
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,370
If instead, the three-year treasury bond is used to hedge,

115
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,060
a similar calculation implies a short position

116
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:39,790
of $1.54 million.

117
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,550
Notice that using the shorter-duration bond to hedge

118
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,850
involves taking a larger position.

119
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,650
That makes a lot of intuitive sense.

120
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,840
The price of the shorter-duration bonds

121
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,610
is less sensitive to yield changes.

122
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,860
Therefore, it requires a larger position and absolute value

123
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,680
to get the same dollar price sensitivity to yield changes.

124
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,130
To evaluate what happens to prices under the hypothetical

125
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,950
that all yields rise by 1% overnight,

126
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,730
it's necessary to use the basic formula relating a bond's price

127
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,820
to its discounted cash flows.

128
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,620
The way it's done on this slide is

129
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,630
to calculate the percentage price changes

130
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:30,840
for each of the bonds based on the assumed $1,000 face value.

131
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,540
That percentage change is then applied

132
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,710
to the original present value of each of the positions.

133
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:45,400


134
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,770
Alternatively, you could have solved

135
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,300
for the face value of each bond from the initial hedge ratio

136
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,470
amounts, calculated the corresponding coupon payments,

137
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,520
and then re-discounted the new higher rates.

138
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,790
In either case, the conclusion from the calculations

139
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,700
is that had the dealer not hedged her position,

140
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,750
she would have taken a loss of $40,656

141
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,250
on her corporate bond holdings.

142
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,280
You can see the very good news is that the delta hedge is

143
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,220
quite effective either using the three-year Treasuries

144
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,560
or the 10-year Treasuries.

145
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,380
Adding together the loss on the corporate bonds

146
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,360
and the gain on the treasuries, you

147
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,970
can see on that, she comes out just slightly

148
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,982
behind using the 10-year bond and slightly ahead using

149
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:34,815
the three-year bond.

150
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,549


151
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:44,190
What's the reason for the differences here?

152
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,280
Well, as you might have guessed, the differences in outcomes

153
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,300
can be explained by convexity differences.

154
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,720
The 10-year Treasury has a much greater convexity

155
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,200
than the three year treasury, and the convexity

156
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
of her long position falls in between that

157
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,850
of the two treasuries.

158
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,760
You might have thought that she would have done better using

159
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,350
the 10-year Treasury because it is more convex,

160
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,880
and convexity is a good thing.

161
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,830
However, you have to remember that whereas greater convexity

162
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,980
is helpful in a long position, the dealer

163
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,110
is shorting the Treasuries.

164
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,370
She's worse off when the short position involves a higher

165
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,930
convexity bond.

166
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,600
The general conclusion we can draw from this

167
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,870
is that a delta hedge will have better results when

168
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,880
the convexity of the long position

169
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,580
is greater in absolute value than the convexity

170
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,360
of the short position.

171
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,120
However, there may be other factors also

172
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,460
that would influence your choice of which bonds

173
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,060
to use to set up a delta hedge.

174
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,870
For instance, in this case, the three-year treasury,

175
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,340
because of its shorter duration, necessitates a much larger

176
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,960
short position.

177
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,990
That could involve additional transactions costs

178
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,010
or make it harder to find a counterparty.

179
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,290
Had the dealer wanted even greater protection

180
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,020
against losses, she could have constructed

181
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,930
a gamma-neutral position that not only matched

182
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,810
the hedge ratios of her long and short positions

183
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,140
but also matched their gammas.

184
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,650
In this example where there's only two different securities

185
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,410
available to use to take the short positions,

186
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,530
there's only one way to set up a gamma hedge.

187
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,140
That will involve transacting in both

188
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,300
of the Treasury securities.

189
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,790
The quantities transacted will be

190
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,490
selected to match the hedge ratio

191
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,520
and also to match the gamma, as shown in these equations.

192
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,830


193
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,890
Here, this involves solving two linear equations

194
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,240
for two unknowns.

195
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,670
And you can see the complete solution

196
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,965
in a write-up on the course web page.

197
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,860


198
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,990
In reality, because there are many bonds that

199
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,450
could be used to set up a gamma hedge,

200
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,590
there would be many ways to implement it.

201
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,100
And as for delta hedging, the choice

202
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,320
between the different possibilities

203
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,890
would depend on factors such as cost and availability.

204
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,200
Now, you may be wondering, if it's

205
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,340
more effective to gamma hedge, why not always do that instead

206
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,290
of just delta hedging?

207
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,830
The answer is that it's more complicated and usually more

208
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,180
expensive to gamma hedge.

209
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,530
So if a delta hedge provides sufficient protection,

210
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,430
it's going to be the easier and cheaper approach.

211
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,120
Now, there's many situations where

212
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,260
a hedge may be required for an extended period of time,

213
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,810
not just overnight.

214
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,180
In such cases, another consideration

215
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,940
is that the hedge will need to be adjusted over time

216
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,450
as rates, and therefore durations, change.

217
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,970
More frequent adjustments of delta hedge

218
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,560
are a substitute for gamma hedging.

219
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,220
That is, frequently adjusting a delta hedge, which is also

220
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,630
known as dynamic hedging, is a substitute for putting

221
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,690
on a more robust gamma hedge that

222
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,690
can be adjusted less frequently for the same amount

223
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,500
of protection.

224
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,000
