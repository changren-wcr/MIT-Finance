00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
PROFESSOR: Those strategies can be

1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,380
used to manage the risk of a cash position,

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,550
say, as we saw with the example of Southwest Savings Bank whose

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,420
mortgage assets were much more sensitive to interest rate risk

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,614
than were the liabilities that it used to fund them with.

5
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:19,150


6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,880
Those strategies are also often used

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,760
to manage the risk of derivatives positions that

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,960
are being held--

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,620
for instance, by a bank that accepted the short side

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,229
of a forward interest rate contract initiated

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,860
by one of its clients.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,970
Later in the course, we'll see that duration and convexity are

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,330
also properties of interest rate sensitive options,

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,660
like puts and call options on bonds.

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,170
Those options then can be similarly used in interest rate

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,490
risk management strategies using the concepts of duration

17
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,860
and convexity.

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,890
We'll also see that duration corresponds

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,700
to the idea of a delta, and that convexity corresponds

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,450
to the idea of a gamma in the more general language

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,680
of options pricing.

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,520
In fact, that's how the strategies that we're looking

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,160
at here got their names.

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,810
You may remember being introduced

25
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,570
to the concepts of duration and convexity

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,810
earlier in the MicroMasters Program.

27
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,770
But you may not already know is that duration and convexity are

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,220
two of the most fundamental and powerful concepts

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,000
for measuring, hedging, and speculating on interest rate

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,120
risk.

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,060
There's several different ways that duration and convexity

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,530
are defined.

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,260
We'll start with the basics and then go on

34
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,350
to more advanced versions of these concepts that

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,610
are much more accurate when cash flows are uncertain.

36
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,310
The advanced concepts are important,

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,420
for example, for risk management strategies involving

38
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,200
callable bonds, pre-payable mortgages, or bonds

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
with significant credit risk.

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,120
We'll look at the math behind the basic formulas

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,910
and develop intuition for what they

42
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,900
mean with a graphical interpretation.

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,230
In order to do the basic calculations involving duration

44
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,050
and convexity, the Excel spreadsheet, convexity.xls,

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,140
is available on the course web page.

46
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,030
You should download it and make sure you

47
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,690
know how to use it to reproduce the basic examples discussed

48
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,180
in this lecture.

49
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,080
You will find it to be useful in answering some of the homework

50
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,870
problems too.

51
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,170
These next two slides illustrate the historical interest rate

52
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,170
volatility that has been a major source of risk

53
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,110
for institutions such as banks, portfolio

54
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,240
managers, and hedge funds.

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,660
Notice that I'll use the terms rates and yields

56
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,780
interchangeably when describing market conditions

57
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,360
in general terms.

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,850
In recent years, short-term interest rates,

59
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,490
both in the US and other developed countries,

60
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,190
have been unusually low and quite stable.

61
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,250
Historically, though, that's an unusual situation

62
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,770
and one that's likely to change again in the future.

63
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,680
This graph shows short term rates

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,350
on three-month US Treasury bills going all the way back

65
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,470
to the 1930s.

66
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,970
You can see that there were periods,

67
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,940
like in the late 1970s and early 1980s,

68
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,030
where rates rapidly climbed and then rapidly fell.

69
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,590


70
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,060
These were periods of extreme rate volatility.

71
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,460
Where does interest rate volatility come from?

72
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,890
Narrowly, interest rates are prices

73
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,900
that move to clear the market for borrowing and lending.

74
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,130
And volatility arises from changes in the supply of

75
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,680
and demand for credit.

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,500
Taking a step back, though, a variety

77
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,920
of macroeconomic factors drive the supply and demand

78
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,290
for credit, and therefore volatility,

79
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,470
including expectations about future inflation

80
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,510
rates and other government policies

81
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,430
and the strength of the economy.

82
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,960


83
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,620
This graph of long-term rates in the United States

84
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,540
goes back much further, all the way back to the late 1700s.

85
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,300
You can see that long-term rates have also

86
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,110
been quite volatile with long-term trends that sometimes

87
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,640
rapidly reverse themselves.

88
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,660
If you were to compare the volatility of short

89
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,870
and long-term rates over the same fixed horizon--

90
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,130
say, of five years--

91
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,110
you would find that the standard deviations of short-term rates

92
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,780
are higher than those of long-term rates.

93
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,130
Long-term rates tend to change more slowly over time.

94
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,680
For that reason, the risk exposure

95
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,440
to rate changes at different points on the yield curve

96
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,790
varies.

97
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,790
Market participants seeking a reliable hedge

98
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,210
have to take those differences and volatility into account.

99
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,815
And we'll see how to do that.

100
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:09,550


101
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,500
Interest rate or yield volatility

102
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,020
translates directly into price volatility

103
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,030
for fixed income securities.

104
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,570
That's because bond prices and yields are related.

105
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,240
Given a bond's price, you can find its yield.

106
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,630
And given a bond's yield, you can find its price.

107
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,470
The simplest example of this is for a zero coupon bond

108
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:37,450
with price P, promised face value F, yield per period,

109
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,530
little r, and maturity of N periods.

110
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:49,710
Clearly, if r goes up, P goes down, and vice versa.

111
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,100
You can also see that this inverse effect

112
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,030
is magnified as the number of periods increases because

113
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,370
of compounding.

114
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,220
From the perspective of a banker, securities dealer,

115
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,460
or fund manager dealing in fixed income securities like bonds

116
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,210
and mortgages, it's often not the rate risk in itself

117
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,620
but rather its impact on the value of the securities

118
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,250
in their portfolio.

119
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,160
In other words, the price risk--

120
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,130
that's the main concern.

121
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,550
For example, if an upward shift in the yield curve

122
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,240
causes a bank's assets to fall in value by more

123
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,480
than it reduces the value of a bank's liabilities,

124
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,660
that will cause a hit to the bank's capital

125
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,960
that may create operational or regulatory problems.

126
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,950
Or in the extreme, it could push it into insolvency.

127
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,790
In the last class, we saw how swaps or futures contracts that

128
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,000
matched the maturity of the quantity being hedged

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,610
could reduce that sort of risk.

130
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,220
This week, we'll see how those derivatives can

131
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,720
be used to hedge the risk with much more flexibility using

132
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,500
the concepts of duration and convexity.

133
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,000
