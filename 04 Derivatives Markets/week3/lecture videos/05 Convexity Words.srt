00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820


1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,600
PROFESSOR: Let's now turn to the second-order relation

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,860
between bond prices and yields, which is known as convexity.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,190
Convexity measures the degree of inward curvature

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,710
of the price-yield relationship.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,379
It's based on the second derivative of a securities

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,870
price with respect to its yield.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,830
As for duration, there are basic and generalized convexity

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,670
measures with those described as effective being

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,400
the most accurate in general.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,140
We will see that convexity is used

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,340
to improve upon duration-based approximations of price risk

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,280
and in many hedging strategies.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,910
It's usually used in combination with duration rather than

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,560
as a standalone tool.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,750
A long position in noncallable bonds

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,670
always has positive convexity, which is a desirable property.

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,760
All else equal, higher convexity means

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,820
that prices increase more when yields fall

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,460
and decrease less when yields rise.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,360
By the same token, short positions and noncallable bonds

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,580
always have negative convexity, which

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,800
is an undesirable property.

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,130
Convexity is also affected by any embedded options.

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,040
And it can be altered by taking derivatives positions

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,060
as we'll see in a little while.

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,770
Turning to the mouth, convexity is

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,230
calculated by taking the second derivative

28
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,010
of the price-yield relationship and dividing by the bond price.

29
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,980
It takes cash flows as certain as in the derivation

30
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,040
of Macaulay or modified duration.

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,940
Then we differentiate twice, divide by the bond price,

32
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,130
and we have the formula for convexity.

33
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,350


34
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,750
Whereas duration has units of years,

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,450
convexity has units of years squared.

36
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,470
It's not helpful to try to interpret it in those terms.

37
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,200
However, because the formula is complicated,

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
it's quite helpful to have a mental shortcut

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,210
to know that for a zero-coupon bond,

40
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,570
convexity is approximately its maturity squared.

41
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,030
For the same reasons as setting up a hedge often

42
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,230
uses dollar duration, it's often useful to know the dollar

43
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,790
convexity.

44
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,750
Dollar convexity is standard or effective convexity

45
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,475
multiplied by the bond price.

46
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:23,320


47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,480
Also remember that you don't have

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,800
to use this formula by hand.

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,300
You can use the convexity calculator for much of the math

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,425
that you'll be asked to do.

51
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:35,700


52
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,970
Looking again at a plot of the actual price yield relationship

53
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,300
provides a more intuitive understanding of convexity

54
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,520
and why it can be used in hedging strategies

55
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,740
to create more robust hedges.

56
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,770
The green-shaded area here indicates

57
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,530
the convexity is related to the curvature

58
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,990
of the actual price-yield curve.

59
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,430
So here we have the actual price-yield curve.

60
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,330
It's a convex function because it's inward curved.

61
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,870
And if we had a different bond with more inward curvature,

62
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,580
we would describe it as more convex.

63
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,780
The more convex a bond or fixed income portfolio, the greater

64
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,580
that degree of inward curvature.

65
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,250
Holding duration constant, you can also

66
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,220
see that the greater convexity is a good thing.

67
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,650
Because for any shifts in yields,

68
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,450
the price is higher than in the case of less convexity.

69
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,240
It's important to note that technically that statement is

70
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,840
only true for parallel shifts in the yield curve.

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,530
Greater convexity is usually a good thing,

72
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,090
but it's not an arbitrage opportunity.

73
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,120
Well, let's get back to the idea of approximating a price

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,570
change with the duration approximation.

75
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,020
Remember that algebra corresponds to sliding down

76
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:09,915
the tangent line say when yields go from Y* to Y-new here.

77
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:12,810


78
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,310
So again, we're sliding down the tangent line.

79
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,930
The estimated new price is less than the actual price

80
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,475
by this vertical distance.

81
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:26,410


82
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,680
If the error gets larger, the more convex the bond

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,460
is because there's more inward curvature.

84
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,120
A correction to our formula based on convexity

85
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,610
can be used to increase the accuracy of our estimate,

86
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,040
getting closer to the true new price.

87
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,140
So a convexity correction will pull up our estimate,

88
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,890
but we'll see it actually overshoots a bit.

89
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,750
Some positions exhibit what's called negative convexity.

90
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,850
And mathematically, negative convexity

91
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,190
is the same thing as concavity.

92
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,140
One example is a short bond position.

93
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,200
Remember that a short position always

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,490
flips the actual price-yield curve over the x-axis.

95
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,720
Negative convexity also rises in some long positions

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,230
such as for callable bonds over some range of yields.

97
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,580
And that's what's pictured here.

98
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,000
That's because as rates fall, the bond

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,950
becomes more likely to be called before maturity,

100
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,780
which puts an upper bound on its price appreciation.

101
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,870
We'll return to that when we talk about call options.

102
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,150
What's important to understand here

103
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,830
is that negative convexity is unfavorable for either a long

104
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,140
or a short position because it makes

105
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,500
outcomes worse for any given change in yields,

106
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,260
again, holding all else equal including duration.

107
00:05:52,260 --> 00:06:00,600
So it's moving us down relative to the straight line

108
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,665
or the tangent line.

109
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:04,930


110
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,810
We just saw graphically that a convexity adjustment

111
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,540
to a duration-based estimate of price changes

112
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,520
can improve that estimate.

113
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,980
The algebra that corresponds to that idea

114
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,165
is given in this equation.

115
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:20,330


116
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,300
It relates the percentage change in the bond price

117
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,210
to minus the duration times the change

118
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,530
in the yield, the term that we have seen before,

119
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,440
plus a new term, which is adding one

120
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,810
half the convexity times the change in the yield squared.

121
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,440
Some of you might recognize this as a second-order Taylor series

122
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,470
expansion of the equation for the price of a bond.

123
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,470
Going back to an example that's similar to the one we looked

124
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,790
at earlier, let's approximate the percentage price change

125
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,940
for a 25-year 6% coupon bond priced to yield 9% when there's

126
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,330
a 2% increase in its yield.

127
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,480
Using the duration and convexity calculator,

128
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,370
you can verify that the modified duration is 10.62,

129
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:20,700
and the convexity is 182.92.

130
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,690
Plugging these values into our formula for the percentage

131
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,280
price change produces an estimated decline in price

132
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,720
of 17.58%.

133
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,530
The actual price change is 18.03%,

134
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,780
which is actually pretty close considering

135
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,040
that a 2% change in yields is a really large jump that's

136
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,380
unlikely to occur over any short time period.

137
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,620
This calculation also shows the size of the improvement

138
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,560
from including the convexity correction.

139
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,790
The duration approximation alone implies a 21.24% price drop,

140
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,220
which is more than three percentage points too large.
