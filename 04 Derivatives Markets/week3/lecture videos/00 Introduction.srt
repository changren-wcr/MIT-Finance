1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,030
PROFESSOR: The biggest use of forward futures and swap

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,360
contracts are by financial institutions, like banks

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,600
and pension funds, seeking to manage their exposure

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,380
to interest rate risk.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,530
This week, we're going to focus on the most

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,680
popular and versatile strategies for managing interest rate

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,010
risk using these derivatives, combined with cash market

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,180
transactions.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,210
Those strategies are based on two characteristics

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,550
of a security or portfolio that are

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,760
used to quantify the risk arising from the interest rate

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,240
volatility-- duration and convexity.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,510
We'll go over the concepts of duration and convexity

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,760
and how they can be applied to cash market

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,720
positions like a bond portfolio and to derivatives

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,960
like swaps and interest rate futures contracts.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,790
Then we'll look at their application

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,970
in a very important class of hedging strategies known

19
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,080
as delta and gamma hedging.
