J. R. SCOTT: Hello everyone and welcome to the third recitation

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,530
of 15.435x.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,720
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,250
three problems related to duration, convexity, and delta

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,050
hedging.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,350
Without further ado, let's begin with problem 1.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,830
Problem 1 asks us to consider a 2-year bond with a coupon

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,130
rate of 4%, annual payments, and is

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,030
priced at $98 per $100 face value

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:36,408
for an effective annual yield of 5.077%.

11
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:39,320
In Part A, we are asked to calculate the modified

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,750
duration of this bond.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,430
Sounds easy, right?

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,930
Well, the first thing to notice here

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,040
is that the yield we are given is an effective annual yield.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,980
What does that mean?

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,340
A bond's effective annual yield is a simple interest rate

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,790
earned on the bond over a year, taking into account all

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,490
compounding opportunities.

20
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,160
In order to use the convexity calculator provided

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,210
by Professor Lucas to find the bond's modified duration,

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,860
we first need to convert this effective annual yield, or EAY,

23
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,410
into a bond equivalent yield.

24
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,770
A bond equivalent yield is the single interest rate

25
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,920
that equates the price of a bond to the present value

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,410
of its future cash flows, assuming

27
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,880
semi-annual compounding.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,950
This is the most frequent notation in which

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,950
you will see yields quoted.

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,450
Now, the simple conversion for an effective annual yield

31
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,210
into a bond equivalent yield is to use

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,210
the formula in equation 1.

33
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,450
In particular, the effective annual yield

34
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,500
is equal to 1 plus the bond equivalent yield divided

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,510
by 2 squared minus 1, where y subscript

36
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,120
ea is the effective annual yield,

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,640
and y subscript be is the bond equivalent yield.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,950
Plugging in 5.077% for the effective annual yield

39
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,270
into equation 1, we can solve for the bond equivalent yield

40
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,330
to be 5.014%--

41
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,180
close, but slightly smaller than the effective annual yield.

42
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,850
Now, given that we have the bond equivalent yield,

43
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,640
we can find the modified duration of the bond

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,100
by inputting the following parameters

45
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,690
into the convexity.xls calculator.

46
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,160
In particular, N, which is the maturity in years of the bond,

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,330
is set to be 2.

48
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,520
The frequency for the coupon payments

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,630
is set to be 1, since we have annual coupon payments.

50
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,480
The coupon rate is 4%.

51
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,150
The face value of the bond at maturity

52
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,660
we will normalize to be $100, and the yield on the bond

53
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,380
equivalent basis is 5.014%.

54
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,930
When you calculate both the convexity and the duration,

55
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,070
you'll find that the Macaulay duration is 1.96 years,

56
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,950
and the modified duration, which is what this question was

57
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,280
asking us, is 1.866 years.

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
In Part B, we are asked to use the modified duration

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,430
that we calculated in part a to estimate

60
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,330
the new price of the bond if the bond's effective annual yield

61
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,470
increases to 6.5%.

62
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,990
Do you expect the actual price of the bond

63
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,540
to be higher or lower than your estimate here?

64
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,190


65
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,740
The first thing we need to do is to recall

66
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,990
that we can approximate the dollar price

67
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,710
change in a bond for a given change in its yield using

68
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,020
the following expression, which I have numbered equation 2.

69
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,150
On the left-hand side, dP is the change in the price of a bond.

70
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,080
On the right-hand side, DM is the modified duration

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,740
of the bond, P is the bond's price,

72
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,640
and dy is the change in the yield of a bond.

73
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,760
Effectively, this approximation relates

74
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,100
the change in the price of the bond to its modified duration.

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,260
Now, plugging in the modified duration of 1.866 years

76
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,510
for the bond that we calculated in Part A,

77
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,880
the change in the yield of 6.5% minus 5.077%,

78
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,380
which is equal to 1.423%, and the bond's price of $98,

79
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,910
we see that dP, the change in the bond's price is negative

80
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,310
$2.60.

81
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,850
In other words, the new price of the bond after the increase

82
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:52,250
in yield is $95.40.

83
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,120
Now, do we expect the actual change in the bond's price

84
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,000
to be higher or lower than the one obtained

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,980
using the approximation in equation 2?

86
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,320
Recall that we can improve our approximation

87
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,290
by including the impact of convexity, that

88
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,740
is, the second derivative of a bond's price with respect

89
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,680
to its yield.

90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,580
The approximation that includes both duration and convexity

91
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,010
can be written as follows in equation 3.

92
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,070
This equation is very similar to equation 2.

93
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,460
Notice that the first term on the right-hand side is the same

94
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,040
as that is in equation 2 but now we have this an additional term

95
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,540
--

96
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,100
this convexity term, which is equal to 1/2 times the bond's

97
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,730
convexity, which I denote by C sub 0,

98
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,760
times the bond's price, times the square

99
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,470
of the change in yield, dy.

100
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,650
Since a long position in a non-callable bond,

101
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,000
like the one in this example, has positive convexity,

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,860
the second term on the right-hand side

103
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,550
will be positive, and the actual change in price

104
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,860
will be lower than the one obtained

105
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,440
using the approximation in equation 2

106
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,660
that includes only duration.

107
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,150
More generally, positive convexity

108
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,730
means that duration will underestimate

109
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,270
the price increase that results from a drop in the yield

110
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,120
and overestimate the price decrease

111
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,690
from an increase in the yield.

112
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,720
In the last part, Part C, we are asked

113
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,170
to imagine that we want to immunize a liability that

114
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,620
comes due in 3 and 1/2 years.

115
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,010
If you want to invest in an immunizing portfolio that

116
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,490
consists of both the 2-year coupon bond in part a

117
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,870
and one of the following three bonds,

118
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,050
which bond would you choose?

119
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,540
Now, assume here that all coupons are paid annually.

120
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,420
The first option is a 3.5-year, 6.25% coupon bond with

121
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,080
an effective annual yield of 5.5%.

122
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,770
The second option is a 10-year, 3.9% coupon

123
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,120
bond with an effective annual yield of 4.9%.

124
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,210
And the third option is a 3.5-year,

125
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,780
zero coupon bond with an effective annual yield

126
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,525
of 4.65%.

127
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:18,660
First, what is immunization?

128
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,210
Well, immunization is the procedure

129
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,330
of matching the durations of our assets

130
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,960
and our liabilities in order to minimize interest rate

131
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,620
risk, fluctuations in prices that come from changes

132
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,340
in interest rates over time.

133
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,580
The question is asking us, which bond

134
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,430
should we choose to combine with our 2-year bond

135
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,250
in order to immunize our liability that

136
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,410
has a duration of 3.5 years?

137
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,150
In other words, which combination of the 2-year bond

138
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,690
and one of these three bonds will have a duration that

139
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,840
approximately matches the 3.5-year duration

140
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,630
of our liability?

141
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,930
Well, using the same convexity.xls calculator

142
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,130
that we used in Part A, we can find the modified durations

143
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,260
of each of the three bonds to be,

144
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:14,870
for the first bond, 3.24 years, for the second bond, 8 years,

145
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,130
and for the third bond 3.34 years.

146
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,670
The first thing to notice right off the bat is that

147
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,840
the 3.5-year coupon bond is not suitable for our immunization

148
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,530
portfolio because it has a modified duration of less than

149
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,090
3.5 years, such that any combination with the 2-year

150
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,950
coupon bond, which itself has a modified duration of 1.866

151
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,280
years, would have too short a duration to immunize

152
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,960
our liability.

153
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,460
The second thing to notice is that the 3.5-year zero coupon

154
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,050
bond is feasible but almost all of our immunizing portfolio

155
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,570
would have to be invested in this bond.

156
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,560
Why?

157
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,090
Well, we know that the Macaulay duration of a zero coupon bond

158
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,810
is equal to its time to maturity, or in this case, 3.5

159
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,920
years.

160
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,220
Well, that exactly matches the duration of our liability

161
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,030
that we're trying to immunize, which means that almost 100%

162
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,540
of our portfolio would have to be invested in the zero coupon

163
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,470
bond.

164
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,790
A better option is a combination of our 2-year and 10-year

165
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,550
coupon bond.

166
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,370
For suitable portfolio shares, it not only

167
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,070
immunizes our liability, but it'll also

168
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,210
have a higher yield and higher convexity than an immunizing

169
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,870
portfolio that includes the 3.5 year zero coupon bond.

170
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,320
Intuitively, the way that we know that it has a higher

171
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,370
convexity is to realize that the payoffs of this 2-year

172
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,690
and 10-year portfolio are more spread out, like a barbell,

173
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,160
than the bullet payoff of a simple 3.5-year zero coupon

174
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,500
bond.

175
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,000
