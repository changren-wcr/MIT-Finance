1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,450
PROFESSOR: OK, now for problem 2--

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,360
problem 2 states that you are managing a pension fund that

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,780
has a single payment liability in the amount of $25 million

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,780
coming due four years from today.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,910
You wish to immunize this liability

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,420
by making investments today that will have a guaranteed terminal

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,200
value of $25 million in four years.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,360
Two investments are available--

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,690
first, two-year zero coupon notes

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,690
and second, five-year zero coupon notes.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,720
In Part A, it's stated that, if today's yield curve

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,050
is flat at 10%, how much must be invested

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,920
in each security in order to immunize this liability?

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,330
Assume annual compounding.

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,170
Generally, immunization involves two steps--

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,330
equalizing both the present values

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,190
and the modified durations of our assets and liabilities.

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,170
Let's assume that the two-year and five-year

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,670
zero coupon notes have face values of $1,000.

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,430
Since the yield curve is flat at 10%,

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,620
the price of the two-year zero coupon note

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,170
is simply $1,000 divided by 1.1 squared, which

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,980
is equal to $826.45.

24
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,310
Similarly, the price of the five-year zero coupon note

25
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,530
is $1,000 divided by 1.1 to the fifth, which

26
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,450
is equal to $620.92.

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,890
Since the liability involves a single payment of $25 million

28
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,800
in four years, its present value is $25 million

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:49,720
divided by 1.1 to the fourth, which is equal to $17,075,336.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,260
Since we know that the Macaulay duration of a zero coupon bond

31
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,630
is equal to its time to maturity,

32
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,690
the modified duration of the two-year zero coupon note

33
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:04,070
is the time to maturity, 2 years, divided by 1.1,

34
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,250
which is equal to 1.82 years.

35
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,960
Similarly, the modified duration of the five-year zero coupon

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,160
code is 5 years divided by 1.1, which

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,850
is equal to 4.54 years and the modified

38
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,790
duration of the liability is 4 divided by 1.1,

39
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,770
which is equal to 3.64 years.

40
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,580
Now, let n2 be the number of two-year zero coupon

41
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,960
notes required to immunize liability, and n5

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,560
be the number of five-year zero coupon notes.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,630
In our first step of immunization,

44
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,350
we can equate the present values of assets and liabilities

45
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,710
in the equation shown--

46
00:02:46,710 --> 00:03:00,330
826.45 times n2 plus 620.92 times n5 equals 17,075,336.

47
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,820
In the second step, we're going to equate

48
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,670
the value-weighted average durations of assets

49
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,910
and liabilities in the equation below.

50
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,210
1.82, which is the modified duration

51
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,260
of the two-year zero-coupon note, times n2 times

52
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,200
the price of the two-year zero-coupon note divided

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,090
by the total value of our portfolio plus 4.54,

54
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,175
which is the modified duration of the five-year zero coupon

55
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:37,490
note, times n5 times 620 divided by 17,075,336

56
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:43,490
equals 3.64, the modified duration of our liability.

57
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,890
We can solve the system of two equations and two unknowns,

58
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,850
n2 and n5, and find that we should invest

59
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:55,910
in n2 equals 6,836 of the two-year zero-coupon notes

60
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,730
and n5 equals 18,401 of the five-year zero-coupon notes

61
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,250
in order to immunize the liability.

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,580
Remember, each of the bonds here have a denomination of $1,000.

63
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,620
In dollar amounts, that means that we

64
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:18,519
should invest in 6,836 times 826.45, which

65
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,710
is equal to $5.65 million of the two-year zero-coupon notes,

66
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:30,790
and 18,401 times 620.92, which equals $11.42 million

67
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,850
of the five-year zero-coupon notes.

68
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,650
Notice that 5.65 plus 11.42 is roughly

69
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:47,520
equal to the $17,075,336 amount of our liability.

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,750
OK, Part B says that if interest rates at all maturities

71
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,350
rise from 10% to 11%, would you consider

72
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,650
yourself better or worse off than if interest rates had

73
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,480
remained at 10%?

74
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,550
Explain your choice with the calculation,

75
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,130
and also explain intuitively why you think this is the case.

76
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,160
Well, first, let's go over the intuition.

77
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,880
It's very similar to the barbell versus bullet intuition

78
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,550
that we reviewed in Problem 1.

79
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,800
Specifically, since the cash flows

80
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,960
of our immunizing portfolio, which

81
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,650
consists of two-years in five-years zero-coupon notes,

82
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,260
are more spread out, like a barbell,

83
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,550
than the single bullet liability that comes due in four years,

84
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,760
the convexity of our immunizing portfolio

85
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,170
is likely greater than that of the liability.

86
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,300
And all else equal, we like convexity

87
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,680
when interest rates change.

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,580
Thus, if interest rates rise from 10% to 11%,

89
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,250
we will likely be better off as the value

90
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,460
of our immunizing portfolio will fall by less

91
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,510
than that of our liability.

92
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,090
To verify this intuition mathematically,

93
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,520
we can simply calculate the present values

94
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,700
of the liability and our immunizing portfolio

95
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,020
under the assumption that interest rates are now 11%.

96
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,840
In particular, the present value of the liability

97
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,480
coming due in four years will decrease

98
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:22,000
from $17,075,336 to $25 million divided by 1.11 to the fourth,

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,490
which is equal to $16,468,274.

100
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,710
The price of the two-year zero-coupon note,

101
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,560
now that interest rates are 11%, is

102
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:41,660
1,000 divided by 1.11 squared, which is equal to $811.62.

103
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,180
And the price of the five-year zero-coupon note

104
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,180
is now 1,000 divided by 1.11 to the fifth,

105
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,520
which is equal to $593.45.

106
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,120
Thus, the present value of our immunizing portfolio,

107
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,220
using our n2 an n5 amounts that we found in Part A,

108
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:09,050
is equal to $811.62 times $6,836 --

109
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,050
that's n2, the amount that we invested in the two-year

110
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,700
zero-coupon note --

111
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,430
plus $620.92 times $18,401--

112
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,450
that's n5, the number of five-zero zero-coupon notes we

113
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,750
purchased -- which equals $16,973,783 --

114
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,580
which, compared to the new present value of our liability

115
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,550
of $16,468,274, is greater.

116
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,170
One thing to note before we end Problem 2 is that, in practice,

117
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,120
once there is a change in interest rates,

118
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,270
like the increase from 10% to 11% in this example,

119
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,880
our portfolio shares --

120
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,070
the n2 two and n5 --

121
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,280
have to be adjusted in order to reimmunize the liability

122
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,850
to match the present values and duration of the liability.

123
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,480
Such adjustments in practice can involve non-trivial trading

124
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,110
costs that make reimmunization a little bit more difficult

125
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,500
than it is in this stylized example.

126
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,000
