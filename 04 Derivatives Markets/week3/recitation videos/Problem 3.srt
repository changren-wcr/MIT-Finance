00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,390
PROFESSOR: Finally, let's review the last problem, Problem 3.

1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,850
Problem 3 states that you are a manager

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,300
of a hedge fund that specializes in the fixed income market.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,250
The fund's portfolio currently consists

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,460
of these three positions in which all yields are

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,600
bond equivalent yields, which, if you recall from Problem 1,

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,770
are annual yields that assume semi-annual coupon payments.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,050
The first position is a short position

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,660
in $150,000 face value of a 7-year 2.8% coupon

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,480
bond with semi-annual coupon payments

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,880
that is priced to yield 3.95%.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,640
The second position is a long position

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,370
in $350,000 face value of a 3-year 2.25% coupon

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,520
bond with, again, semi-annual payments

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,280
but is now priced to yield 2.75%.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,170
The third and final position is a long position in $425,000

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,370
face value of a 14-year 4.6% coupon

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:13,020
bond with semi-annual payments and is priced to yield 4.125%.

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,240
As a portfolio manager, you decide

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,660
to delta-hedge the interest rate exposure of your fund's

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,100
portfolio using a 3-year interest rate swap.

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,840
The swap specifies a semi-annual exchange of 6-month LIBOR

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,490
for a fixed payment of 3.5%, paid semi-annually.

23
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,860
That is a fixed payment of 1.75% every 6 months.

24
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,360
The current 6-month LIBOR rate is 1.4%.

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,390
As a warm-up, Part A simply asks whether we

26
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,090
would want to be a fixed or a floating rate

27
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,527
payor in the swap?

28
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,110
Well, you don't actually have to do any calculations to answer

29
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,430
this question.

30
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,210
It's pretty clear from the sizes of our long positions

31
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,090
and short positions that on net, we

32
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,510
will be receiving fixed payments from our portfolio.

33
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,420
In other words, we are long duration

34
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,330
and in order to delta-hedge the interest rate

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,550
risk to our fund's equity, we want

36
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,240
to be a fixed rate payor, equivalently, a floating rate

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,830
receiver in the swap.

38
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,340


39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,110
Now, let's assume that you calculate

40
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:30,680
the dollar duration of your portfolio to be $4,743,387.

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,360
Part B is simply asking--

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,160
what would be the notional principal

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,490
of the swap, in which we are a fixed rate payor, that

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,150
delta-hedges our portfolio?

45
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,420
The first thing to recall here is that an interest rate swap

46
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,050
is equivalent to a long position in a fixed rate bond,

47
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,660
in a short position in a floating rate bond,

48
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,510
or vice versa, depending on whether or not

49
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,270
we are a fixed rate payor or a floating rate

50
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,380
payor in the swap.

51
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,660
Both positions, the long position

52
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,450
and the short position, are initially priced at par.

53
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,820
To find the notional principal of the swap,

54
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,560
we first need to find the modified

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,700
durations of the fixed and floating legs of the swap.

56
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,610
To find the modified duration of the fixed leg of the swap,

57
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,670
we can use the convexity.xls calculator

58
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,260
that we used in Problem 1.

59
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,670
Recall that the problem statement

60
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,120
says that the swap specifies a semi-annual exchange

61
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,410
of 6-month LIBOR for a fixed payment of 3.5% paid

62
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,220
semi-annually.

63
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,880
Thus, in our convexity.xls calculator,

64
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,580
we can substitute in the appropriate parameters

65
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,290
for a semi-annual fixed payment of 3.5% and three years

66
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,660
to maturity, and find that the modified

67
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:54,350
duration of the fixed leg of the swap is 2.8245 years.

68
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,350
What about the modified duration of the floating

69
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,190
leg of the swap?

70
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,680
Well recall, called that the Macaulay duration

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,960
of the floating leg of the swap is

72
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,870
equal to the time to the next reset.

73
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,280
In this case, since there are 6 months until the next reset,

74
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,820
the Macaulay duration will be, in years, 0.5.

75
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,630
Thus, the modified duration of the floating leg of the swap

76
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,450
is equal to 0.5 divided by 1 plus 0.014,

77
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,310
which is the current 6-month LIBOR

78
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,710
rate of 1.4%, divided by 2 to express it as a 6-month rate.

79
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,190
That equals 0.4965 years, which is

80
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,510
the modified duration of the floating leg of the swap.

81
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,210
The last step, in order to find the notional principal

82
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,900
of the swap, is to equate the hedge ratios, or dollar

83
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,660
durations, of our portfolio with that of the swap.

84
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,760
In the equation shown, the left-hand side

85
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,860
is the hedge ratio, or dollar duration

86
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:04,390
of our portfolio, which was given to be $4,743,387.

87
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,720
The hedge ratio, or dollar duration, of our swap

88
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,370
is equal to the notional principal

89
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,810
of the swap in dollars--

90
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,760
which I denoted by S--

91
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,850
times the difference between the modified duration

92
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,180
of the fixed leg of the swap and the modified duration

93
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,430
of the floating leg of the swap.

94
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,450
It's fixed minus floating here because, as in Part A,

95
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,510
we determined that we wanted to be a fixed rate

96
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:34,240
payor, equivalently a floating rate receiver, in the swap.

97
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,340
Solving for S, you should find that the notional principal

98
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:44,220
of the swap is $2,037,560.

99
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,960
Well, that's it for Problem 3.

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,300
Thank you for attending this week's recitation.

101
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,560
And I look forward to seeing all of you next week.
