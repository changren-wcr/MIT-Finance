1
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:02,430
PROFESSOR: All right, that does it for problem one.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,500
Let's move on to problem two.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,250
In problem two, we are asked to estimate the value of a new six

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,990
month European-style arithmetic average price call option

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,970
on a non-dividend paying stock.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,410
The initial stock price is $30.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,470
The strike price is $30.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,480
The risk-free rate is 5%.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,100
And the stock price's volatility is 30%.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,040
In part A, we are asked to perform this estimation

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,190
by writing a program to run a Monte Carlo

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,930
simulation to estimate the price of the option.

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,610
Use 5,000 stochastic paths for the risk neutral representation

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,750
of the evolution of stock prices assuming log-normality,

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,910
drawing innovations from a normal distribution,

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,860
and with a time step, h, equal to 1 month.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,470
Before performing the Monte Carlo simulation,

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,160
let's first see if we can derive a closed-form expression

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,890
for the value of the average price call option.

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,260
Since this material is admittedly more advanced

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,300
than what we usually see in lecture,

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,480
feel free to skip directly to the Monte Carlo simulation

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,080
if desired.

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,830


25
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,070
The options payoff here is going to depend on the arithmetic

26
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,710
average of the price of the underlying stock

27
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,000
throughout the life of the option.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,780
In particular, the payoff is the maximum of 0

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,170
and the average price of the stock, S sub average,

30
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,520
minus the strike price.

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,040
Under the assumption that the average price of the stock

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,910
is log-normally distributed, the average price call

33
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,340
can be valued using a similar formula

34
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,380
to the one we've used to price a regular European call option.

35
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,850
Suppose M sub 1 and M sub 2 are the first two

36
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,270
moments of the average price of the stock, which recall,

37
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,550
is log-normally distributed.

38
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,660
The first two moments correspond to the mean and the volatility

39
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,440
of that distribution.

40
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,600
The value of the average price call

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,650
is given by Black's model, equation one here.

42
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,540
This is identical to the equation

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,020
we saw for Black's model in the last recitation.

44
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,430
However, now, the forward, or futures, price of the option

45
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,570
is equal to the first moment of the log-normal distribution

46
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,610
of the average stock price.

47
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,570
And similarly, the volatility of the forward or futures price

48
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,350
is equal to 1 over t times the natural log

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,550
of the second moment divided by the first moment squared,

50
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,790
that equation at the bottom of the slide.

51
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,150
Assuming that the average is calculated continuously,

52
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,370
then we get the following two expressions

53
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,510
for the first and second moments of the log-normal distribution

54
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,270
of our average stock price.

55
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,360
These expressions are not too intuitive.

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,070
So we'll just say that if we plug

57
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,540
in the risk free rate of 5%, q, the dividend yield of 0

58
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,320
since is a non-dividend paying stock, our volatility, sigma,

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,320
of 30%, our time to maturity, 0.5 for six months,

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,150
the initial stock price of 30, and the strike price of 30

61
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,180
to the expressions for M1 and M2 above,

62
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,100
we get that the first moment, M1 is equal to 30.378.

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,940
And the second moment is equal to 936.9.

64
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,400
Consequently, the volatility of F, sigma squared sub F,

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,400
is equal to 1 over t times the natural log

66
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,210
of M2 divided by M1 squared, which is equal to 17.41.

67
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:52,010
Finally, from equation one on the previous slide,

68
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,660
we can find the value of the average price call as follows--

69
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,820
the exponential of the negative risk

70
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,800
free rate, expressed as a decimal,

71
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:08,150
times 0.5, the time to maturity, times 30.378 and 1 times N

72
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:15,000
of d1, which in this case is 0.163, minus 30,

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,190
which in this case is the strike price times N of d2,

74
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,150
which is equal to $1.64.

75
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,230
Now that we've seen how we can derive an analytical expression

76
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,860
for the value of the average price call option using Black's

77
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,700
model, let's see how we can use Monte Carlo in order

78
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,840
to find a numerical approximation of the value.

79
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,680
In particular, we can simulate the log-normal stock price

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,160
process under the risk neutral representation using

81
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,560
the following algorithm: the stock price at time t plus some

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,060
time step, h --

83
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,810
or in this case, the time step is equal to 1 over 12 for one

84
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,830
month --

85
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,850
is equal to the current stock price times the exponential

86
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,990
of the difference between the risk free rate, r, and sigma

87
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,150
squared divided by 2 times the time step plus sigma times

88
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,090
the square root of h times epsilon

89
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,850
where epsilon is an independent and identically

90
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,330
distributed standard normal increment.

91
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,530
After generating 5,000 different paths for the stock price using

92
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,210
this algorithm, we can calculate the payoff on each path i

93
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,740
as follows--

94
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,180
Vi, the payoff on each path, is equal to the maximum

95
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,170
of two different terms.

96
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,990
The first is the average of the stock price over the six months

97
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,690
for that path i minus the strike price, K. The second term

98
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,190
is zero.

99
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,430


100
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,190
Finally, after calculating the payoff on each path i,

101
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,740
we can find the value of the average price call

102
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,960
by discounting the average payoff over all the paths i

103
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,770
where there are 5,000 of them by the exponential

104
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,240
of negative 0.5, the risk free rate, times 0.5,

105
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,450
the time to maturity of the option.

106
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,480
For time step h equals the 1/12, you

107
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,680
should find that the value of the average price call option

108
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,250
is roughly equal to $1.89.

109
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,890
Note that this is very close to the analytical result of $1.64

110
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,070
that we derived above using Black's model.

111
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,700
On the next slide, I have some example R code that shows you

112
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,160
how to numerically do this.

113
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,800
You don't need to know how to program in R in order

114
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,400
to understand the code at a high level.

115
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,380
In the first part of the code, I'm

116
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,590
merely setting up the parameters necessary in order

117
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,410
to perform the Monte Carlo simulation.

118
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,600
In particular, I'm setting number

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,210
of simulated paths, the length of the time step,

120
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,980
the length of maturity of the option,

121
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,570
the initial value of the stock, the volatility of the stock,

122
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,170
the risk free rate, the strike price,

123
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,830
and a vector that collects the payoff of the option along each

124
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,610
of the simulated stock price paths.

125
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,250
The second part of the code implements a for loop.

126
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,180
Looping over each of the individual stock price paths,

127
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,030
I'm going to simulate a log-normal distribution

128
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,520
for the stock price over that path

129
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,980
and then calculate the value of the option

130
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,580
as the maximum of the difference between the average stock

131
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,290
price over that path and the strike price and 0.

132
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,180
The final line of the code merely

133
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,760
implements the formula to calculate

134
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,370
the value of the average price call option

135
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,320
that we saw on the previous slide, this one here.

136
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,920
OK.

137
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,150
Part B is asking us to repeat that Monte Carlo exercise,

138
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,170
but now setting the time step h equal to 1 week

139
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,930
as opposed to one month, assuming here

140
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,260
that six months is equal to 26 weeks,

141
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,790
or equivalently, that there are 52 weeks in a year.

142
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,660
The R code that I provide below is almost identical to the R

143
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,340
code that we just saw.

144
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,080
Only now, the time step h is equal to 1 over 52 instead of 1

145
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,539
over 12.

146
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,539
The one thing to notice that is that with the smaller time

147
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,539
step, the simulated value of the average price

148
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,800
call of $1.66 at the bottom of the slide

149
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,560
is nearly identical to the analytical result of $1.64.

150
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,880
This makes sense.

151
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,000
The analytical result was a continuous time result

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
from Black's model.

153
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,260
As we shrink the value of the time step,

154
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,530
making it smaller and smaller, from one month to one week,

155
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,420
we're getting closer to that continuous time approximation.

156
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,770
Finally, in part C, we are asked that if we use the same Monte

157
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,200
Carlo simulation of stock prices as we

158
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,190
did in part B, what would be the price of a knock-in call

159
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,180
option with a strike price of $30 and a barrier level of $35?

160
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,620


161
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,830
The first thing to do is to recall that a knock-in call

162
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,210
option comes into existence when the stock price reaches

163
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:41,900
its barrier level, in this case $35, before expiration.

164
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,140
Using the same algorithm to simulate the log-normal stock

165
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,870
price process as we did in part B,

166
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,430
in particular with the time step h equal to 1 over 52 for one

167
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,660
week, we can simulate the payoff of the knock-in call

168
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,250
on a particular stochastic path as the maximum

169
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,390
of the difference between the stock price at maturity

170
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:10,070
and the strike price, K, and 0 if the stock price reaches its

171
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:15,960
barrier level of $35.00 and 0 otherwise.

172
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,910
The R code on the next slide is going

173
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,320
to have the implementation of this Monte Carlo simulation.

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,390
Ultimately, the price of the knock-in call

175
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,430
will be estimated to be $2.65.

176
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,530
The code is incredibly similar to the code

177
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,710
that we saw for parts A and part B. Only this time,

178
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,510
we have an extra parameter, B, for the $35 barrier level

179
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,370
of the knock-in call option.

180
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,990
And at the end of our for loop, we have a condition.

181
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,940
So if the maximum price of the stock along the simulated

182
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,360
stochastic path is greater than the barrier level,

183
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,630
then we calculate the value of the call option as we have

184
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,560
before --

185
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,520
the maximum of the difference between the average price

186
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,980
of the stock along its path and the strike price, K, and 0.

187
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,310
Otherwise, if the maximum value of the stock

188
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,820
price along its simulated path is not

189
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,090
greater than the barrier level, then the value of the option

190
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,330
will be worthless.
