JR SCOTT: Hello everyone, and welcome to the seventh
recitation of 15.435x.
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing three problems
related to the material covered in the week seven
lecture on exotic options.
In particular, in the first problem
we'll see how the binomial model could
be used to price a puttable convertible bond.
In the second problem, we'll see how
we can use a Monte Carlo simulation to find
the price of an average price call option.
And in the third problem, we'll see how a regular European call
option has the same payoffs as the sum of a down and out call
option and a down and in call option.
