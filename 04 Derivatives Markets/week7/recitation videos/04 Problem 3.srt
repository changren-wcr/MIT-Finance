00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
PROFESSOR: All right, that completes problem two.

1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,270
Let's finish the recitation by reviewing a rather brief

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,360
problem, problem three.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,470
Problem three is quite straightforward.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,700
It asks us to explain why a regular European call

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,450
option is the sum of a down-and-out European call

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,720
option and a down-and-in European call option.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,350
Is the same true for American call options?

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,660
Well, first recall that a down-and-out call

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,370
option is a particular type of a knockout option.

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,950
Specifically, it is a regular call option

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,000
that ceases to exist if the underlying stock price reaches

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,470
a certain barrier level.

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,470
Let's call it H. The barrier level is going to be

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,450
below the initial stock price.

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,110


16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,050
The corresponding knock-in version of the option

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,600
is called a down-and-in call option.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,730
This is a regular call option that

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,780
comes into existence only if the stock price reaches the barrier

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,450
level, H.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,500
So in order to solve this problem,

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,890
we have to consider two different cases.

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,880
In the first case, if the barrier level, H, is reached,

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,180
then the down-and-out call option

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,840
is going to be worth nothing while the down-and-in call

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,820
option will have the same value as a regular call option.

27
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,060
In the second case, if the barrier level, H, is not

28
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,120
reached, then the down-and-in call option

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,090
is worth nothing while the down-and-out call

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,230
option has the same value as a regular option.

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,690
Thus, the payoffs from a portfolio

32
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,210
that consists of a down-and-out call

33
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,360
option plus a down-and-in call option

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,350
are identical to those of a regular European call option

35
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,200
regardless of whether the barrier level, H, is reached.

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,650
However, a similar argument cannot be used for American

37
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:07,110
options because American options have an early exercise premium.

38
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,240
Well, that does it for recitation seven.

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,700
Thank you everyone for coming, and I look forward

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,570
to seeing all of you next week.
