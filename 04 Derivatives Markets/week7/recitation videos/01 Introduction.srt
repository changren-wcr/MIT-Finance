JR SCOTT: Hello everyone, and welcome to the seventh

1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,550
recitation of 15.435x.

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,760
In this recitation, we'll be reviewing three problems

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,400
related to the material covered in the week seven

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,160
lecture on exotic options.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,590
In particular, in the first problem

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,660
we'll see how the binomial model could

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,170
be used to price a puttable convertible bond.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,020
In the second problem, we'll see how

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,260
we can use a Monte Carlo simulation to find

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,410
the price of an average price call option.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,060
And in the third problem, we'll see how a regular European call

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,590
option has the same payoffs as the sum of a down and out call

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,390
option and a down and in call option.
