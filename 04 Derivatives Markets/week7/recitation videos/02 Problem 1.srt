1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,410
PROFESSOR: Without further ado, let's begin with problem 1.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,610
Problem 1 has a long setup, so do bear with me.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,450
A financial firm is offering a synthetic zero-coupon

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,160
puttable and convertible bond on the ABC Company.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,240
It works in the following way.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,710
First, the bond has a promised principal payment

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,550
of $1,000 three periods from now.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,670
Second, at any time after the first period,

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,290
the holder of the bond could either

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,230
exchange it for one share of the ABC stock--

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,180
that's the convertible option--

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,430
or give it back to the securities firm

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,160
in return for a payment of $600.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,830
That's the putable option.

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,940
The securities firm has set aside four shares of ABC stock

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,810
to serve as collateral for each synthetic convertible.

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,570
In particular, the firm can at any time

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,540
fulfill its entire obligation and be required

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,910
to make no other payments by giving

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,660
to the holder of the putable convertible full ownership

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,150
of the four shares of the stock.

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,890
Over each period, the total rate of return on holding ABC stock

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,490
will be either 100% or -50%.

24
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,560
At the end of each period, the stock

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,610
will pay one fifth of its pre-dividend value as a cash

26
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,500
dividend to the investor who held

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,690
the stock during that period.

28
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,540
The remaining 80% of the pre-dividend value

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,230
will then be the ex-dividend stock price at which one

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,410
can purchase stock to hold over the following period

31
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,010
or sell the stock received from either conversion or default.

32
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,640
In other words, over each period,

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,930
the ex-dividend stock price will either increase by 60%

34
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,980
or decrease by 60%, and that's important.

35
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,860
By reinvesting dividends, an investor

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,470
owning one share at the beginning of a period

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,290
will own 1.25 shares at the end of the period.

38
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,890
The current ex-dividend stock price is $1,000,

39
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,949
and the interest rate is 10% per period.

40
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,890
The quoted price of a synthetic putable convertible

41
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,580
is also $1,000.

42
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,270
If the financial firm fully hedges its position,

43
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,560
what will be its realized profit on each bond sold?

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,520
We're going to use a binomial tree risk-neutral pricing model

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,830
in order to solve this problem.

46
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,140
I know we threw a lot of information at you there,

47
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,590
so I've taken the liberty of describing the possible paths

48
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,770
for ABC stock over the next three periods

49
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,500
in the diagram on the slide.

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,330
How did I get these payoffs?

51
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,930
Well, recall that the stock price ex-dividend

52
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,080
will either increase by 60% or decrease

53
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,465
by 60% in consecutive periods.

54
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:57,270


55
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,890
We'll explain in a little bit where

56
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,750
the payoffs on this final column come from but first, as always,

57
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,350
let's work backwards through the binomial tree.

58
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,860
In particular, if the stock price three periods from now--

59
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,450
that is, at the maturity date--

60
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,090
is either $4,096 or $1,024, then bondholders

61
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,630
will certainly choose to convert their bond to a stock,

62
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,500
as the principal payment of the bond is only $1,000.

63
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,090
If instead the stock price on the maturity date is $256,

64
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,040
then bondholders will neither choose

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,220
to convert the bond to a stock nor put it.

66
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,870
And the financial firm will instead

67
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,390
have to pay those bondholders the principal amount of $1,000.

68
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,750
Finally, if the stock price is $64,

69
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,180
the financial firm will settle its obligation

70
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,190
to the bondholders by giving them

71
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,360
the four shares of the stock held as the collateral.

72
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,170
The column to the right of the diagram on that binomial tree

73
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,810
reports the final payoffs to the bondholders

74
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,840
at each of the four nodes at the maturity date:

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:17,500
4,096, 1,024, 1,000, or 256.

76
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,649
Now that we found the value of the putable convertible

77
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,620
at the terminal nodes of the binomial tree,

78
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,770
what will be its value at all the other nodes of the tree?

79
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,080
Well, like we've seen before in this class,

80
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,810
we can find the value of the putable convertible

81
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,840
by applying the fundamental valuation equation

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,380
to obtain the value of the bond if it's held for one more

83
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,560
period on the tree.

84
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,650
This value must then be compared with the value generated

85
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,530
by immediate conversion, that is,

86
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,220
converting the bond to its stock, putting the bond,

87
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,440
or immediately forfeiting the collateral

88
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,480
by the financial firm.

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,350
The final value assigned at each node on the tree

90
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,100
must reflect the optimal behavior by both bondholders

91
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,280
and the financial firm relative to the choices

92
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,560
available to them at the time.

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,320
To be more specific, let's let V,

94
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,430
which is a function of S and n, be the value of the bond when

95
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,840
the stock price is S and there are n periods until maturity.

96
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,120
We can solve for the risk-neutral probability

97
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,650
of an up move, which we'll call q*, as follows.

98
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,770
1000, which is the initial price of the stock,

99
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:38,610
is equal to 2000 times q* plus 500 times 1 minus q* divided

100
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,300
by 1.1, which yields q* equals 0.4,

101
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,820
or 40% for the risk-neutral probability of an up move.

102
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,520
We got the numbers 2000 and 500 because, as you recall,

103
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,670
the total rate of return on holding the ABC stock

104
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,215
will be either 100% or -50% over each period.

105
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,410


106
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,290
Dividing by 1.1 just reflects the fact

107
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,070
that the risk-free rate of interest is 10% each period.

108
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,400
Let's solve for the value of the putable convertible

109
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,900
when n equals 1.

110
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,300
That is, when there is one period remaining

111
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,430
until maturity.

112
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,940
In particular, on the binomial tree diagram,

113
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,760
we're looking at the three nodes corresponding to the stock

114
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:36,960
price of 2560, 640, and 160.

115
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,630
The value of the putable convertible

116
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,850
at the node when n equals 1 and the stock price is 2560

117
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,370
is given by the minimum of two different terms.

118
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,180
The first term is equal to four times the stock

119
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,400
price of that node, which would be

120
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,670
the payoff to the bondholders if the financial firm were

121
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,620
to default on its obligations.

122
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,250
The second term is itself the maximum

123
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,600
of three different terms.

124
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,700
The first, 2560, is the payoff to the bondholders

125
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,370
if they convert their bond to a stock.

126
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,870
The second, 600, is the payoff to the bondholders

127
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,870
if they put the bond and receive 600.

128
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,690
The third term is the payoff to the bondholders

129
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,630
if they keep the bond, which itself

130
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,550
is given by the fundamental valuation equation, which

131
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,180
is 0.4, the probability of an up move

132
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,670
in the risk-neutral measure, times the price

133
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:44,520
of the stock in the up node relative to the 2560 stock

134
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,260
node at time t equals 1, plus the risk-neutral probability

135
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,380
of a down move, times the price of a stock

136
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,060
in the subsequent down node of 1024,

137
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,280
discounted at the risk-free rate of 10%.

138
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,260


139
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,450
Solving this minimization problem,

140
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,080
we see that the value of the putable convertible

141
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,090
is 2560 at n equals 1.

142
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,390
Similar calculations for the node when the stock price is

143
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,650
640 and n equals 1, and 160 at n equals 1,

144
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:28,290
yield a value of 917.82 and 600, respectively.

145
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,640
Thus, looking at the first node here,

146
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,740
we see that the bond will be converted

147
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,510
to a stock at the node of the tree where S equals 2560.

148
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,409
The put will be exercised when S equals 160,

149
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,210
this bottom node here.

150
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,630
And the bond will be neither converted nor put when

151
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,930
S equals 640, this node here.

152
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,030
We can follow a similar procedure

153
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,170
to find the value of the putable convertible when n equals 2.

154
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,420
That is, when there are two periods remaining to maturity.

155
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,450
On the binomial tree diagram, that

156
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,330
corresponds to the two nodes where the stock price is either

157
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,470
1600 or 400.

158
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,560
For the node when the stock price is equal to 1600,

159
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,720
the value of the putable convertible

160
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,690
will be equal to, again, the minimum of two terms.

161
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,250
The first term, four times 1600, is the payoff

162
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,170
to the bondholders if the firm is

163
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,330
unable to meet its obligations.

164
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,010
The second term is itself the maximum of three terms.

165
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,920
1600, which is the payoff to the bondholders

166
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,190
if they convert their bond to a stock at that node,

167
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,130
600, which is again the payoff to the bondholders

168
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,070
if they put the bond, and the last term,

169
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,010
which is given by the fundamental valuation

170
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,780
equation, which is equal to 0.4, the risk-neutral probability

171
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,990
of an up move to the subsequent node,

172
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:03,090
times the price of the stock in the subsequent up node of 2560,

173
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,560
plus 0.6, the risk-neutral probability of a down move,

174
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,290
times the value of the putable convertible

175
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,810
in the subsequent down node, which

176
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:19,410
we found on the previous slide to be equal to 917.82.

177
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,450
Discount that at the risk-free rate,

178
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,300
solve this minimization problem, and we

179
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,090
see that the value of the putable convertible,

180
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,240
at the node where the stock price is equal to 1600,

181
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,350
at n equals 2, is 1600.

182
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,350
A similar exercise can be used to find

183
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,390
the value of the putable convertible

184
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,480
at the node when the stock price is equal to 400 and n

185
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,730
equals 2, which is equal to 661.025.

186
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,120
Thus, the bond will be converted to a stock

187
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,180
at the node of the tree where S equals 1600,

188
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,750
this top node here, and the bond will neither be converted

189
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,260
nor put when the stock price is equal to 400,

190
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,080
this bottom node here.

191
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,490
OK, just one more step.

192
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,670
Remember, the initial price of the stock is equal to 1000.

193
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,410
So we can solve for the value of the putable convertible bond

194
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,920
at the initial node of the tree as follows.

195
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,220
The value of the putable convertible bond

196
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,680
is given by the fundamental valuation equation to be 0.4,

197
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,930
the risk-neutral probability of an up move, times 1600, which,

198
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,970
as we saw in the previous slide, is

199
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,940
the value of the putable convertible bond in the up

200
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,550
node at n equals 2, plus 0.6, risk-neutral probability

201
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,810
of a down move, times 660.025, which,

202
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,750
again, as we saw on the previous slide,

203
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,540
is the value of the putable convertible bond

204
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,720
in the down node at n equals 2.

205
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,590
Discount that the risk-free rate,

206
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,390
we get that the value of the putable convertible bond

207
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,410
is 942.3771.

208
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,670
In other words, if the financial firm fully hedges its position,

209
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,100
its realized profit on each bond sold

210
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,860
will be 1000 minus 942.3771, which

211
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,120
is roughly equal to $57.6229.

212
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,000
