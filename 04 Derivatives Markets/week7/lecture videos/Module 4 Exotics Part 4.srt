PROFESSOR: Compound options are options that

1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,330
are written on other options.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,980
Those would include a call on a call, a put on a call,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,250
a call on a put, and a put on a put.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,736
Or the chain could have even more steps--

5
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:17,550
a call on a call on a call, for example.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,100
These compound options typically must

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,090
be priced by backward induction on a binomial tree.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,610
Compound options are actually more common

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,490
than you might first imagine because they arise

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,970
in many situations and, particularly, in the context

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,500
of real investment options.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,670
For example, think about an investment in higher education.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,250
In a two-year college program, you

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,800
might have an option in the first year

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,410
to enroll with a payment of $10,000.

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,100
And then, in year 2, you have the option

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,800
to complete the second year for an additional tuition

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,130
payment of another $10,000.

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,210
The option to continue in year 2 is like a regular call option

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,260
with a strike price of $10,000, which you would exercise when

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,720
the present value of the degree at that point

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,750
exceeds the $10,000.

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,970
The option to enter into the two-year program

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,045
in the first place is what makes it a compound option.

25
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:21,300


26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,390
Another type of exotic is a gap option.

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,300
A gap call option has a payoff based

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,150
on the difference between the underlying asset price

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,560
and a fixed strike price, K1.

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,560
But the payoff is only realized when the asset price

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,080
is greater than a barrier, K2.

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,840
The formula for a gap option is given here.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,290
When the underlying assets satisfy

34
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,130
the usual Black-Scholes-Merton assumptions.

35
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,870
Notice that K1 is like K in the standard Black-Scholes-Merton

36
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,310
formula, but that the probabilities N of d1 and N

37
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,810
of d2 depend on the probability of being over the barrier,

38
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,580
rather than over the strike price.

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,600


40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,990
This is a payoff diagram for a gap call

41
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:22,080
option with a strike, K1, of 90 and a barrier, K2, of 100.

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,880
To answer the question on the slide

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,840
of whether the option costs more or less than a similar option

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,400
without the gap, we can draw the path diagram on a call option

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,130
with a strike price of 90 and no barrier.

46
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:43,730


47
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,050
We can see that the difference in payoffs between the two

48
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,130
is this triangular region.

49
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,430
In this region, our regular call option

50
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,470
has a higher payoff than the gap option.

51
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,530
Therefore, the gap option is worth

52
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,380
less than the traditional call option.

53
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,740


54
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,980
The final stop on this whirlwind tour of exotic options

55
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,780
is one of my favorites.

56
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,030
A quanto is an exotic option that

57
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,970
provides a payoff in one currency that's

58
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,620
directly based on an index value in a second currency.

59
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,960
It allows investors to take a position

60
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,680
in a risky foreign asset without any exchange rate risk.

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,540
For example, the Nikkei put warrants traded on the American

62
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,170
Stock Exchange are quantos because the payoffs

63
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,100
and the premiums are in dollars but the payoff is directly

64
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,580
scaled by the yen price of the Nikkei index

65
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,880
relative to a yen strike price.

66
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,390
That allows investors to take a positional bet on the direction

67
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,510
of the Japanese stock market without exposure

68
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,630
to the risk of the dollar-yen exchange rate.

69
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,300
That exchange rate risk couldn't be completely

70
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,670
hedged with a regular forward contract

71
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,070
because there's uncertainty about the size

72
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,950
of the amount that needs to be hedged when the underlying is

73
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,180
a risky stock.

74
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,990
So what's special about quantos is

75
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,990
that they have an embedded currency forward

76
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,990
with a variable notional amount.

77
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,300
It's that variable notional amount

78
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,580
that gives quantos their name.

79
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,340
Quanto is short for quantity adjusting option.

80
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,000
