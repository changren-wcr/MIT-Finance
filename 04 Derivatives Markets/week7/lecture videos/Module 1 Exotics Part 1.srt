00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
PROFESSOR: The term exotic is an umbrella term

1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,250
that can refer to any nonstandard option.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,980
The possibilities are limitless.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,290
Many exotics are simply constructed

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,930
by tweaking ordinary put and call options

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,540
to better meet a risk management objective

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,970
or to achieve a goal at a lower cost

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,670
than with using standard options.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,250
Other exotics are much more complex.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,670
Whereas many standard options are traded on exchanges,

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,790
exotic options typically are created and sold

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,000
by investment banks and professional money managers.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,210
These writers have exotic options earn a commission

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,600
and they typically hedge their risk exposure, often

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,660
using the Delta or Delta Gamma Hedging Methods

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,770
that we studied earlier.

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,310
The goal here is not for you to memorize or derive

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,740
a large number of pricing formulas.

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,190
For those exotic options for which formulas exist,

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,010
that information can be easily found in books or on the web.

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,320
What I want to focus on instead as we

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,989
go through these examples is first,

22
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:10,350
what's the rationale for the use of a particular exotic option?

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,580
Second, can the exotic option be approximated by a portfolio

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,800
of ordinary options?

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,050
That sort of comparison is useful,

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,430
both for understanding what the option is intended to achieve,

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,830
and also how to price it.

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,590
In particular, those links can sometimes

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,010
show us how to modify the Black-Scholes-Merton equations

30
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,500
to price an exotic.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,440
Third, is the exotic option cheap or expensive

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,300
relative to a standard option that achieves a similar goal?

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,490
That information is helpful in deciding

34
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,140
whether the difference in protection

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,110
offered by the exotic is worth the price difference.

36
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,490
And fourth, what are the general approaches for pricing them

37
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,680
when there isn't a formula available?

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,960
In answering that question, you'll

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,940
acquire a new and valuable skill,

40
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,640
which is to know the basics about how to price options

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,150
using Monte Carlo simulations.

42
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,020
The first stop on our tour of exotics is Bermuda.

43
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,880
Bermudian options falls somewhere

44
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,040
between American and European options

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,610
because that can be exercised on certain pre-specified dates

46
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,110
prior to expiration.

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,000
Now, if you look at Bermuda on a map,

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,940
you'll see it's in the Atlantic between America and Europe,

49
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,960
and that's how these options got their name.

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,910
As with any option, where there's

51
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,760
a choice to be made about when it should be exercised prior

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,820
to expiration, Bermudan options are often

53
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,880
valued by working backwards on a binomial tree.

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,730
That allows an analyst to simultaneously infer

55
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,060
the optimal exercise strategy and the value of the option

56
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,120
at each node using risk neutral pricing

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,710
or the equivalent replicating portfolio approach.

58
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,470
Bermudan options can be exotic in other dimensions

59
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,770
as well, such as having strike prices the change

60
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,150
over the life of the option.

61
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,470
An example is employee stock options,

62
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,100
which are sometimes reset to lower the strike price

63
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,270
when they fall far out of the money.

64
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,450
Callable corporate bonds often have an embedded Bermudan

65
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,210
option with a variable strike price.

66
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,020
Those bonds are callable after a call waiting period, which

67
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,110
gives investors some number of years of complete protection

68
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,630
against the bonds being called.

69
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,750
For example, a 10 year bond may have a 3 year call waiting

70
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,770
period, after which the bonds can be called at any time.

71
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,680
On top of that, there may be a declining call

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,690
price, which offers additional protection to bondholders.

73
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,420
Continuing the example, those same bonds

74
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,060
might be callable at 120% of par after 3 years, 110% of par

75
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,260
after 4 years, and then at 100% of par thereafter.

76
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,240
Corporate warrants, which are options

77
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,850
issued by a company on its own stock,

78
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,120
are often structured as Bermudan style securities.

79
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,330


80
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,020
Binary options come in two distinct types, cash or nothing

81
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,150
options and asset or nothing options.

82
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,810


83
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,899
A cash or nothing call option has a unit payoff

84
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,500
if the stock price exceeds the strike price, K at expiration,

85
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,780
and a 0 pay off otherwise.

86
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,410
Similarly, the cash or nothing put option

87
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,290
has a unit payoff if the stock price is less

88
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,020
than the strike price at expiration and a 0

89
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,490
pay off otherwise.

90
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,130


91
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,170
Before looking at the pricing formulas,

92
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,130
I want to introduce the second type of binary option, an asset

93
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,200
or nothing option.

94
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,740
An asset or nothing call pays off the stock price

95
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,300
at expiration as sub capital T if that price exceeds

96
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,020
the strike price, K. An asset or nothing put

97
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,430
pays off the stock price at expiration,

98
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:07,900
ST, if that price is less than the strike price, K.

99
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,640
To understand the pricing formula,

100
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,540
it's useful to observe that a normal call option can

101
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,660
be described as a portfolio that's long

102
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,950
at asset or nothing call option, and short K cash or nothing

103
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,000
call options.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,540
Similarly, a normal put option is a portfolio

105
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,420
that's long take cash or nothing put options

106
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,600
and short in asset or nothing put option.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,230
That observation can be used to interpret the pricing formulas.

108
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,720
Note that the D1 and D2 in these equations

109
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,520
are defined in the same way as in

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,940
the Black-Scholes-Merton model with a constant dividend yield

111
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,850
delta.

112
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,640
For the asset or nothing call, the price

113
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,263
is identical to the first term in

114
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:53,930
the Black-Scholes-Merton written formula for the value of a call

115
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,430
option.

116
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,960


117
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,150
Recall that this formula can be interpreted

118
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,580
as the present value of the expected stock

119
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,120
price conditional on the option expiring in the money

120
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,240
and that's the same thing as the value of an asset or nothing

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,160
call.

122
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,240
Now looking at the cash or nothing call, its price given

123
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,050
here, when multiplied by K, is the negative

124
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,780
of the second term in the Black-Scholes-Merton formula

125
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,990
for the value of a call option.

126
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,530
We also saw earlier that this expression

127
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,080
can be interpreted as the present value of the strike

128
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,770
price multiplied by the probability and of D2

129
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,800
of the option expiring in the money.

130
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,950
Hence, the present value of a unit payoff

131
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,380
is the discount factor multiplied

132
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,455
by the probability of the option being in the money.

133
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:48,050


134
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,560
The same logic holds for binary put options.

135
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,130


136
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,770
We can see then, that binary stock options are

137
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,750
a good example of exotic options that

138
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,700
can be valued by using components

139
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,470
of the Black-Scholes-Merton model

140
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,750
in recognizing their relation to standard options.

141
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,000
