00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
PROFESSOR: The examples we've looked at

1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,680
so far have restricted the Monte Carlo simulation paths

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,060
to be the same as the possible paths through a binomial tree.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,730
However, there's no theoretical reason

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,610
to limit Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,280
the outcomes on a tree.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,370
The main requirement for prices obtained by Monte Carlo

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,920
simulations to be theoretically valid

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,830
is that you need to make sure that the model satisfies

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,120
the conditions for risk neutral pricing.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,150
Restricting Monte Carlo outcomes to mirror the outcomes

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,470
on a tree is one way to ensure that dynamic replication

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,600
or risk neutral pricing is being achieved.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,260
However, once we decide we can use

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,480
risk neutral pricing with a model,

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,660
we can simulate out any distribution.

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,450
For example, with Monte Carlo, we

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,790
can use the lognormal model for stock prices

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,850
directly, which is consistent with the Black-Scholes

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,010
written assumptions.

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,040
As we'll see next, we can also use Monte Carlo

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,620
for more complex situations where

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,470
there are multiple sources of uncertainty.

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,830
That need arises in many instances, including

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,430
for valuing exchange options and for incorporating

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,075
stochastic volatility in models such as the Heston model.

26
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:20,970


27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,600
This slide provides a recipe for computing paths

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
of stock prices using Monte Carlo simulation

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,010
when stock prices are assumed to be log-normally distributed.

30
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,950
The time step is denoted by h.

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,100
And starting from a stock price at time t,

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:43,010
S sub t, on a given path, the stock price at time t plus h

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,880
is given by this formula.

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,010
The stock price on the next step here

35
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,060
is the current stock price multiplied by a constant drift

36
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,620
term plus a shock term based on a draw, epsilon,

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,430
from a standard normal density.

38
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,390
This is the drift, and this is the stochastic term

39
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,490
based on epsilon.

40
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,520
This method uses a risk neutral pricing approach.

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,460
And the rate r in the drift term denotes the risk-free rate.

42
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,190
Sigma is set to match the actual estimated

43
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,900
volatility of the underlying stock estimated either

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,040
using historical data or implied volatilities.

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,620
Now, sigma enters this equation in two places.

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,490
One is that it shows up as a correction

47
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,680
to the drift in the term minus sigma squared over 2.

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,680
And that's something that's a technical correction

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,470
that you can read about in the whole textbook.

50
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,040
The volatility is also incorporated through the term

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,360
sigma times root h times epsilon, where again, h

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,450
is the size of the time step and epsilon

53
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,430
is a draw from a standard normal density.

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,370


55
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,920
In Excel, you can draw a standard normal shock using two

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,300
built-in functions--

57
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,720
NORMINV combined with RAND.

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,630
And the expression here, NORMINV of RAND comma 0 comma

59
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,700
1, where 0 sets the mean to 0 and 1

60
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,560
sets the standard deviation to 1.

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,870
Well, it can be proven mathematically

62
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,360
that the expected gross rate of return

63
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,870
on the stock in this risk neutral representation,

64
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,580
the expectation of S sub t plus h over S sub t,

65
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,520
will, in fact, equal e to the risk-free rate times h

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,440
as the number of simulations gets large.

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,920
It's also true that as the number of Monte Carlo runs

68
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,420
becomes large, the variance of the log of S sub t

69
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,230
plus h over S sub t, which is the same thing as the variance

70
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,750
of the return over an interval h,

71
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,820
converges to sigma squared h.

72
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,330
And so the variance of returns on an annualized basis

73
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,720
converges to sigma squared, which is what we want.

74
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,100


75
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,600
To illustrate what this looks like in practice,

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,020
this graph shows the results of a few Monte Carlo

77
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,780
simulations of 10-step paths.

78
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,960
The outcomes are generated using the formula and procedure

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,600
described on the previous slide.

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,760
Monte Carlo is particularly useful

81
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,740
when valuing a derivative that involves two

82
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,990
or more stochastic processes.

83
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,110
For example, this becomes important to value options that

84
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,660
involve the relative prices or returns

85
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,850
on two different stocks.

86
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,180
Consider an option that pays the maximum between the return

87
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,030
on Google and Apple stock over a time period cap T.

88
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,180
The payoff can be written as shown here.

89
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,450
To value the security, we need to model the distribution

90
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,140
of the possible outcomes and discount the expected value

91
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,510
back to time 0.

92
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,900
We can do this using the risk neutral processes

93
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,880
for each of the two stocks, which we'll call S and N,

94
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,140
as we did before in the discussion of exchange options.

95
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,220
Now, each Monte Carlo run involves simulating out

96
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,150
the stock price path for S and N using the formula

97
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,565
for the evolution of the lognormal stock price.

98
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:38,360


99
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,300
Notice that the evolution of both

100
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,060
is driven by draws from the standard normal density

101
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,130
function, here denoted by epsilon 1 for S

102
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:56,300
and by epsilon 2 for N.

103
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,880
In this example, treating the returns

104
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,430
on the two stocks as uncorrelated

105
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,290
would be unrealistic.

106
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,300
Google and Apple are both tech stocks,

107
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,860
and their returns tend to have a positive correlation.

108
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,950
Fortunately, there's an easy way to build

109
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,680
in correlation numerically between epsilon 1

110
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,570
and epsilon 2.

111
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,880
That's to use this formula here.

112
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,420


113
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,410
We choose epsilon 2 at each time step t

114
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,820
by setting epsilon to a t equal to rho,

115
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,340
the correlation between the two stocks,

116
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,550
times epsilon 1 at time t plus the square root of 1 minus rho

117
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,260
squared times epsilon hat at t, where epsilon hat is

118
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,030
another independent draw from the standard normal density

119
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,530
function.

120
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,650


121
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,750
One can prove that epsilon 2 will

122
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,150
have a mean of 0, a variance of 1,

123
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,220
and the desired correlation rho, with epsilon 1 at each time.

124
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,400
I've found this formula extremely useful in valuations

125
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,830
I've done for various projects that involve

126
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,440
complex contingent claims.

127
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,330
I recommend that you commit to memory

128
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,070
that this formula is available for you

129
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,040
to use if you plan to work with derivatives.

130
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,900


131
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,660
To give you an idea of the estimated magnitudes

132
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,750
for exotic options involved in the comparison of returns

133
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,080
on two different stocks, here's a numerical example.

134
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,170
We'll assume that the annualized volatility for both

135
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,400
of these stocks is 0.3, that the risk-free rate is 2%,

136
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,540
and that the correlation between their returns is 0.7.

137
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,880
A Monte Carlo simulation analysis

138
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,860
implies that the option is worth about 1.134.

139
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,710
The second example is to consider the type of exchange

140
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,340
option that I described earlier, where the payoff depends on

141
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,360
whether or not the return on one stock, S, for instance, Google,

142
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,660
is higher than the return on a second stock, N,

143
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,270
which could be Apple.

144
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,270
The same Monte Carlo simulation implies

145
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,600
that the value of this option is much lower at 0.1.

146
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,540
That's consistent with what you should expect.

147
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,550
A payoff that is positively related

148
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,860
to the maximum of the two random variables

149
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,930
is worth more than one that will depend

150
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,000
on the difference between them when they have

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,050
a large positive correlation.

152
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,410
A final example is implementing the Heston model in order

153
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,909
to use it to price options.

154
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,280
In the last class, this model was

155
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,309
introduced as a way of better incorporating the fact

156
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,740
that, first, stock price volatility varies

157
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,539
stochastically over time.

158
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,770
And second, that implied volatility is found in the data

159
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,180
to be systematically higher for options with low moneyness

160
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,880
leading to a volatility smirk or smile.

161
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,180
The equations here give the time paths using the Heston model

162
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,480
for a stock price and for the volatility process that

163
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,160
determines the variance.

164
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,470
Recall that to get a smile or smirk,

165
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,860
it's necessary to assume a negative correlation

166
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,760
between the shocks driving the stock price and the shocks

167
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,150
driving the volatility process that, in turn, enters

168
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,900
into the price process.

169
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,690
The graphs here show one sample path

170
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,710
that comes out of a Monte Carlo simulation model for the stock

171
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,880
price and also for the corresponding volatility

172
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,220
process.

173
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,640
Volatility tends to be higher when the stock price is lower,

174
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,220
but the two series are not perfectly correlated.

175
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,110
We've come to the end of this introduction

176
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,420
to exotic options and the approaches that

177
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,690
are used to value them.

178
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,600
We've seen that to understand a new exotic option that you

179
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,170
might encounter, the key questions you should start with

180
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,290
include, what purpose or purposes does it serve?

181
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,270
Can its payoffs be approximated or replicated

182
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,120
by a portfolio of ordinary options?

183
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,570
And what intuitively should be the key determinants

184
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,230
of its value?

185
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,900


186
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,000
We focused on the three main approaches

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,290
for valuing exotic options using an analytic formula, often

188
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,510
a variant of the Black-Scholes-Merton model,

189
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,740
when that's available, binomial trees, and Monte

190
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,730
Carlo simulation.

191
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,600
I emphasized the binomial trees are particularly important when

192
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,750
an option has an element of being American-style

193
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,050
and a decision has to be made about the optimal time

194
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,610
to exercise it.

195
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,210
Working backwards on a tree that has ordered outcomes

196
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,490
makes it possible to solve for value and the optimal strategy

197
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,260
simultaneously.

198
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,010
We also saw that risk neutral Monte Carlo simulation

199
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,590
is a popular and versatile tool for pricing

200
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,350
complex derivative securities.

201
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,630
The basic process with Monte Carlo

202
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,190
always involves three steps.

203
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,490
First, simulate many risk neutral paths

204
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,070
for the value of the underlying asset.

205
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:16,690
Second, for each path, compute the discounted simulated payoff

206
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,910
on the derivative of a security.

207
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,090
And third, estimate the derivative price

208
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,820
as the average of discounted payoffs

209
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,185
across all of the paths.

210
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,550


211
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,410
We saw that there are many derivatives that

212
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,170
can be valued equally well with the binomial approach

213
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,540
or with Monte Carlo simulations.

214
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,740
In such cases, there are usually computational pros and cons

215
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,730
to each alternative that will determine the best method.

216
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,910
I emphasized that Monte Carlo simulation

217
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,400
can be especially useful for valuing

218
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,270
path-dependent securities, like Barrier options, Asian options,

219
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,010
and Lookback options.

220
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,060
For these types of options, it's possible, but more complicated,

221
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,270
to value them using a binomial tree.

222
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,720
We also saw that Monte Carlo is the logical choice for payoffs

223
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,390
that rely on more than one stochastic factor,

224
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,760
such as the maximum of two stock returns

225
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,280
or the differences between them.

226
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,300
Finally, Monte Carlo is often the best way

227
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,720
to incorporate more general stochastic asset

228
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,740
processes, such as those with stochastic volatility,

229
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,900
stochastic interest rates, or jumps.

230
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,390
There's certainly a lot to think about here.

231
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,510
And the recitation and homework problems

232
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,090
should be helpful in cementing the concepts

233
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,990
and providing practice using them.

234
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,990
Truly mastering this material will put you

235
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,440
in a strong position to be able to understand and estimate

236
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,950
the value of just about any sort of exotic derivatives

237
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,500
that you might encounter in the future.

238
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,000
