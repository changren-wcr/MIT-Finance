PROFESSOR: Welcome to week 7 of Derivatives Markets.
This week, our focus will be on exotic options.
I want to start with a description of some of the most
common types of exotic options and the risk
management problems they were designed to help solve.
We'll then turn to how they're valued.
Although for some exotic options,
it's possible to drive closed form pricing formulas that
are variations on the BSM pricing model,
others can only be valued numerically.
You'll learn how to use a method we haven't talked
about before, Monte Carlo simulation,
as an alternative approach to binomial trees
in some situations.
