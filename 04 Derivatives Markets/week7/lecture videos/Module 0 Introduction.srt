PROFESSOR: Welcome to week 7 of Derivatives Markets.

1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,720
This week, our focus will be on exotic options.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,360
I want to start with a description of some of the most

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,970
common types of exotic options and the risk

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,940
management problems they were designed to help solve.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,280
We'll then turn to how they're valued.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,200
Although for some exotic options,

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,470
it's possible to drive closed form pricing formulas that

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,350
are variations on the BSM pricing model,

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,960
others can only be valued numerically.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,390
You'll learn how to use a method we haven't talked

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,480
about before, Monte Carlo simulation,

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,210
as an alternative approach to binomial trees

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,780
in some situations.
