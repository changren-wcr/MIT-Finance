00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
PROFESSOR: Just as their name suggests,

1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,480
barrier options have features that

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,550
depend on the underlying asset hitting a barrier value

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,910
specified in the contract.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,740
Barrier put and call options fall

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,910
into three broad categories.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,530
First, there's knock-out options that

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,750
go out of existence if the underlying

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,300
price hits a specified barrier.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,960
A down-and-out option is canceled when the price falls

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,700
below a specified barrier.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,540
And an up-and-out option is canceled if the price

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,990
rises above the barrier.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,830
Second, knock-in options are activated when

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,350
a specified barrier is hit.

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,420
A down-and-in knock-in in option is

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,620
activated when the underlying price falls below the barrier.

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,410
And up-and-in option is activated when the underlying

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,760
price rises above the barrier.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,380
The third category, rebate options,

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,350
make a fixed payment when a barrier

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,290
is hit from above, a down rebate,

22
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,340
or hit from below, an up rebate.

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,950
We can ask how did the values of these options

24
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,180
compare to the corresponding options without the barriers.

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,790
Well, clearly these options are worth less

26
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,560
because there are times when they're

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,170
inoperative when a non-barrier option would

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,120
have a positive payoff.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,890
As such, they offer a way to buy more limited protection focused

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,900
on situations where the protection is

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,000
most highly valued.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,540
These can be thought of as alternatives to buying out

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,610
of the money traditional options.

34
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,660
This graph shows an example of how a down-and-in option works.

35
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,855
The strike price in this case is set above the barrier.

36
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:53,380


37
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,490
Also, the stock price, at the time the option is written,

38
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,670
is above both the strike price and the barrier.

39
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,320


40
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,050
The option doesn't become active until the stock price

41
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,490
hits the barrier from above.

42
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:15,610
Along this particular path, that happens

43
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:21,540
when it gets here, which is at about six months.

44
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,910
The payoff on this path will depend

45
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,980
on the asset price and the strike price

46
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,225
at the expiration date.

47
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:29,860


48
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,220
These barrier options must satisfy the parity conditions

49
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,050
that are shown here.

50
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,060
The relationships are intuitive and pretty easy to establish.

51
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,310
For example, consider a portfolio

52
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,930
consisting of an up-and-in call and an up-and-out call,

53
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,140
both on the same underlying stock with the same strike

54
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,420
price, the same barrier, and the same expiration date.

55
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,390
As long as the underlying stock price stays below the barrier,

56
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,050
then the up-and-out call is operative

57
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,810
and the up-and-in call is inoperative.

58
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,770
If it hits the barrier from below, things switch.

59
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,380
The up-and-in option becomes operative

60
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,800
and the up-and-out call option becomes inoperative,

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,790
thus just one of the options is always in effect

62
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,160
and the barrier doesn't really matter.

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,950
The outcome is the same as with a standard call.

64
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,230
As with other parity relationships,

65
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,900
the formulas can be useful when you have a pricing

66
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,510
formula for two of the options involved

67
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,560
and want to infer the value of the third option.

68
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,510
Now pricing these options typically

69
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,110
involves a binomial tree or Monte Carlo simulation.

70
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,860
And we'll get to those soon.

71
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,530
But the example here shows the value

72
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,830
of a variety of barrier currency put options.

73
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,870
You can think of it as a continuation

74
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,760
of the previous example we were looking

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,700
at where the strike prices represent

76
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,960
the dollar value of one euro.

77
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,580
If you look at the outcomes closely,

78
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,060
you can verify that the prices shown

79
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,190
satisfy the parity relations.

80
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,770
You should also be able to convince yourself

81
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,790
that the qualitative pattern of prices relative to the two

82
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,610
different option types, the different strikes,

83
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,550
and the different barrier values all make sense.

84
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,290


85
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,050
Lookback options have payoffs or strike prices

86
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,590
that give the holder the benefit of perfect hindsight.

87
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,530
That's because they depend on the most favorable outcome

88
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,410
for the option holder over the life of the option.

89
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,130
Lookback options can take a variety of forms.

90
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,520
A floating lookback call has a payoff

91
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,650
at maturity based on the difference

92
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,920
between the underlying price at maturity

93
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,650
and the minimum price of the underlying

94
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,590
over the life of the option.

95
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,020
A floating lookback put, similarly,

96
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,200
has a payoff equal to the maximum price of the underlying

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,100
over the life of the option minus the value

98
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,920
of the underlying at expiration.

99
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,550
Therefore, in both cases, it's the strike price

100
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,170
that's floating.

101
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:23,660
With a fixed lookback call, the strike price K is fixed

102
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,300
but the payoff, if it's positive,

103
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,940
will be based on the maximum price of the underlying

104
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,620
over the life of the option.

105
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,920
And with a fixed lookback put, again the strike price

106
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,030
is fixed at K, but the payoff, if it's positive,

107
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,340
depends on the minimum realized price

108
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,070
over the life of the option.

109
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,840
Not surprisingly, these options are

110
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,720
relatively expensive because the payoffs are higher than

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,610
on otherwise similar options.

112
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,210
Analytical formulas are available to value them.

113
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,260
And those assume a lognormal process for the underlying.

114
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,320
They're also based on the statistical distributions

115
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,380
of the maximum and minimum.

116
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,630
It's also straightforward to value these options

117
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,510
numerically.

118
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,020
Another type of exotic options, shout options,

119
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,730
are closely related to lookback options.

120
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,150
Let me tell you a little bit about them.

121
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,290
With a shout option, the holder has one opportunity

122
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,010
to shout when the price reaches a level that will determine

123
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,630
a floor payoff for the option.

124
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,660
For example, imagine a shout call option

125
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,930
that has a strike price of $25.

126
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,860
And also imagine that the holder of the call shouts

127
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,300
when the price of the underlying asset hits $30.

128
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,310
Well, if the final asset price at expiration is less than $30,

129
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,790
the holder receives the payoff of the $30

130
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,490
that they shouted minus the $25 strike

131
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,190
price, so a payoff of $5.

132
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,120
If the stock price at expiration is greater than 30,

133
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
the holder receives the excess of the asset

134
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,090
price over the $25 strike price as they

135
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,826
would on a regular call.

136
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:15,080
A shout option is a bit cheaper than a lookback option

137
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,310
because the shout, even under an optimal shouting strategy,

138
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,340
may turn out to be less advantageous than the payoff

139
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,260
you'd get with perfect foresight.

140
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,170


141
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,990
A very popular type of exotic option contract

142
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,000
is an exchange option.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,100
An exchange option has a payoff which

144
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,700
depends on the amount by which the price of one asset,

145
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,780
which we'll call S, exceeds the price of a second asset we'll

146
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,430
call capital N. It's a way to make a bet on relative price

147
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,520
movements without exposure to changes in prices that are

148
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,980
common across both securities.

149
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,370
For example, you might want to bet the stock price of Tesla

150
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,950
will fall relative to that of Toyota

151
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,830
but without having to take a stand on whether the price

152
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,040
of auto manufacturers is likely to rise or fall

153
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,830
over the life of the option.

154
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,310
When both assets are assumed to be lognormally distributed

155
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,030
and when the option is European, the valuation formula

156
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,210
Bears some similarity to the Black-Scholes-Merton model

157
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,570
with a second asset N in place of the strike price

158
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,460
on a standard call option.

159
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,110
The formula is given here.

160
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,150


161
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,610
As one would expect, the solution

162
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,190
depends on the variance of both assets

163
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,429
and the correlation rho between them.

164
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,370
The higher that correlation, the less valuable

165
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,590
the option will be because the chance

166
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,020
that the two prices will diverge becomes smaller.

167
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,370
And as usual, the value depends on the dividend yields,

168
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,610
which have to be taken into account because they

169
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,410
affect the relative drift in the two asset prices.
