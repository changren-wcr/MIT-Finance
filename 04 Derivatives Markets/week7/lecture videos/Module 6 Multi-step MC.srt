00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
PROFESSOR: We know that the accuracy of option valuations

1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,490
on binomial trees will be improved

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,039
by increasing the number of steps on the tree,

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,840
all else equal.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,650
We also know that as we take the number of steps to infinity,

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,750
the stock price tree will converge

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,050
to give a lognormal distribution of stock prices, which

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,840
is the assumption underlying the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,900
The same will be true for Monte Carlo simulations

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,550
where, for a fixed expiration date, decreasing the step size

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,090
and adding more steps causes price estimates to become

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,330
more accurate.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,090
For the next few slides, our running example

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,910
will be based on a standard put and call

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,960
option priced using 10 steps.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,450
We'll compare the results using Monte Carlo

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,490
and a binomial tree.

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,470
We'll also compare the results to

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,660
the Black-Scholes-Merton price, which

19
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,270
is expected to provide the most accurate result.

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,260
In these calculations then, the physical expected return

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:13,360
on the stock is set to 10%, its volatility to 30%,

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,250
the risk free rate is 2%, and the initial stock price

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,100
is $100.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,750
The strike price is also $100.

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,300
And as I just mentioned, we're assuming 10 steps

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,905
over a horizon of one year.

27
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:35,850


28
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,150
Those inputs and the resulting outputs using the spreadsheet

29
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,280
program that you've already seen,

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,190
binomial.xls, produces the stock price tree here

31
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,560
and European call option tree here, set to value

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,940
a European call option, which has a value of 12.53

33
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,560
given these assumptions.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,080


35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,600
It's fairly straightforward to modify the Monte Carlo

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,220
simulations to incorporate multiple steps along each path.

37
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,750
For each successive step, a draw from the uniform distribution

38
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,740
from rand is compared to q star to determine if the next step

39
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,910
will be an up or a down.

40
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,200
If an up step is indicated, then the previous value of the stock

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,970
price is multiplied by u.

42
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,200
And if a down step is indicated, it's multiplied by d.

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,750
The parameters q star, u, and d are

44
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,020
calculated as they were for the binomial tree.

45
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,120
And they can be read off of the spreadsheet

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,350
on the previous slide.

47
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,800
Well, for example, this table shows the results

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,150
of the first 10 of 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations, all

49
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,020
starting at a stock price of 100 and taking

50
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,730
steps of 1/10 of a year all the way out to one year, so

51
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,290
10 steps in a year.

52
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,430
In this first simulation, the draws from rand

53
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,960
told us there was a down, another down, then an

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,560
up, and up, and so forth.

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,020
On this simulation path, the outcome

56
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,780
for the stock price at the end of the year is 146.151.

57
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,490
The call is then in the money at that time by 46.151

58
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,130
and the put is out of the money.

59
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,850
The discounted values of those option payoffs

60
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,610
are reported in the first column for the put

61
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,980
and in the second column for the call.

62
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,690


63
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,210
The results for nine more Monte Carlo simulation

64
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,195
runs are shown in these next nine rows.

65
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,760


66
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,590
The equally weighted average of the discounted payoffs

67
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,025
are then the Monte Carlo estimates of the option values.

68
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,930


69
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,440
The results for a 1,000 run Monte Carlo simulation

70
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,680
and the associated standard errors of the estimates

71
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,885
are summarized here on the top left.

72
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,570


73
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,940
The Monte Carlo option price estimates

74
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,250
are close to those from the binomial tree.

75
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,940
For comparison, let's look at the call estimates.

76
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,970
The spreadsheet reports the call prices

77
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,590
estimated from the binomial tree and also from the Black-Scholes

78
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,380
formula.

79
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,900
The Monte Carlo estimate of the call value is 12.637.

80
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,900
The binomial tree gives 12.53.

81
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,030
And Black-Scholes gives 12.82.

82
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,305
These are all pretty close.

83
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:53,280


84
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,140
Remember that the binomial estimate

85
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,690
will converge to the Black-Scholes-Merton estimate

86
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,100
as the number of steps gets very large in the tree.

87
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,530
It's also true that the Monte Carlo estimate

88
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,260
will converge the Black-Scholes-Merton estimate

89
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,230
both as the number of steps gets very large

90
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,810
and as the number of Monte Carlo simulations

91
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,215
also gets very large.

92
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:17,790


93
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,480
We can plot the stock values as a function of the time step

94
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,670
from these simulated values.

95
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,490
Each path is represented here by a different color.

96
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,430
And the results look like the distribution

97
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,470
of paths through the binomial tree but with missing branches.

98
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,960
The branches that are most likely to be missing

99
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,220
are those with the lowest probability,

100
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,310
which means having mostly all ups or mostly all downs.

101
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,710
A larger number of stimulation paths

102
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,240
will tend to fill out those tails of the distribution.

103
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,850
A useful observation then is that for derivatives

104
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,240
whose values are very sensitive to the extreme tails

105
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,810
of the stock price distribution, such as deep out of the money

106
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,530
puts and calls, it becomes very important to use a large number

107
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,460
of Monte Carlo simulations.

108
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,003
