PROFESSOR: The payoff on an Asian option

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,270
is based on an average price over some period of time.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,850
That makes them fundamentally different from the options

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,280
we've studied so far, because instead of depending

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,250
on the value of an underlying asset at a point in time,

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,160
the payoffs are path dependent.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,530
Asian options can be useful for a variety of reasons.

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,270
For instance, they can provide an effective and less expensive

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,510
hedge than a traditional option when a firm's profit depends

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,450
only on the average price of a factor of production,

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,960
like electricity or exchange rates over some time period.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,410
It also makes sense to base option payoffs

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,050
on an average reference price in situations

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,510
where the price at a particular point in time

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,400
may be unreliable.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,200
That could happen because the price could

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,390
be subject to short-term manipulation,

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,190
or it could be prone to big swings

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,190
in thin or illiquid markets.

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,500
An example of a popular Asian option

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,420
is embedded in convertible bonds that

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,580
can be exchanged for some number of shares

23
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,510
of the stock of a company at the bond's maturity.

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,310
There, the conversion factor is often

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,050
based on the average of the stock

26
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,560
price over a period, for instance, 20 days,

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,730
at the end of the bond's life.

28
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,620
I mentioned that an Asian option can

29
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,600
be less expensive than an otherwise

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,850
similar standard option.

31
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,620
Why is that?

32
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,850
It's because the average price is much less volatile

33
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,590
than the underlying price.

34
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,340
Lower volatility translates to lower option value for both

35
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,105
puts and calls.

36
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:36,280


37
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,860
Asian options come in many varieties.

38
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,040
One choice is whether to use a geometric or arithmetic

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,580
average.

40
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,540
Remember that an arithmetic average of a random variable

41
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,570
is found by adding together the outcomes of N draws

42
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,430
and then dividing by N. The geometric average

43
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,550
is found by taking the product of those N draws

44
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,670
and taking them to the 1 over N-th power.

45
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,310
One can prove that the arithmetic average is

46
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,130
greater than or equal to the geometric average,

47
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,979
and the difference between them increases with the volatility

48
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,600
of the random variable.

49
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,880
With Asian options, the averaging

50
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,220
can be applied to the asset price that

51
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,180
determines the payoff relative to a fixed strike price K,

52
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,840
or the averaging can be applied to the strike price

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,490
that the current value of the asset

54
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,370
is compared to at a potential exercise date.

55
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,270
This table summarizes the calculation of the payoffs

56
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,900
depending on whether the option is a put or a call,

57
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,410
whether the averaging is geometric or arithmetic,

58
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,290
and whether the averaging applies to the strike

59
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,360
or to the asset price.

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,150
Clearly, each of those choices will have an effect

61
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,395
on the value of the option.

62
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:53,230


63
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,320
Note, also, that the payoffs in this table

64
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,140
assume the options are European, but they could also

65
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,190
be American.

66
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,800
And that choice, too, often will affect their value.

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,620


68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,310
In this example, we return to a common challenge for exporters,

69
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,580
which is to figure out how to best manage the risk arising

70
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,800
from revenues being in a different currency

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
than production costs.

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,540
Let's assume that a US firm called

73
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,030
XYZ has exports that generate a certain monthly revenue of 100

74
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,130
million euros.

75
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,380
Those revenues are converted to dollars

76
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,190
and repatriated at the end of each month.

77
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,440
XYZ's operating costs are entirely in US dollars.

78
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,080
Uncertainty about future exchange rates

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,930
leaves it exposed to a weakening euro that

80
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,020
could cause revenues in dollar terms to fall below its costs.

81
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,530


82
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,600
We'll call the spot price of a euro

83
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,400
in dollar terms x, where x is a random variable.

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,370
Then in dollar terms, the value of revenues

85
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,430
at the end of the year is also a random variable,

86
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,110
and it's given by this equation here, based on the 100 million

87
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,670
per month times whatever the exchange rate turns out to be

88
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,260
and a future value factor.

89
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,610
Ignoring the usual small effect of the future value factors

90
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,790
over the horizon of just a year, the amount

91
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,850
of euro exposure that XYZ wants to hedge

92
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,260
can be described as 12 months of protection

93
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,750
against its average exchange rate risk

94
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,700
exposure over the year.

95
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,040
An arithmetic average price option

96
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,200
is a natural choice for a hedge that

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,410
protects against the average value of the euro over the year

98
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,510
weakening below some floor exchange rate K. Specifically,

99
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,840
the firm can use an average price put option on the euro

100
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,470
with a payoff equal to the maximum of 0

101
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,690
and K minus the average exchange rate received over the 12

102
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,490
months.

103
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,250
Of course, an average price put option isn't the only way

104
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,200
the exporter could hedge.

105
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,450
It's worthwhile to compare the average price put

106
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,090
option with some of the leading alternatives

107
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,020
and to think about the relative costs and benefits.

108
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,710
One possibility would simply be to buy 12 put

109
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,350
options on the euro that all expire at the end of the year.

110
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,710
A second possibility would be to use a basket of 12 monthly put

111
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,680
options, each with the same strike price

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,870
but with expiration dates of one month, two months,

113
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,170
and so on out to 12 months.

114
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,930
A final alternative would be to use a currency

115
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,220
swap that exchanges euros for dollars.

116
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,980
To make these comparisons more concrete,

117
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,360
let's assume that the current exchange rate is $0.9 per euro,

118
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,660
that the strike price in all cases where there's an option

119
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,460
is at the money at 0.9, that the dollar risk-free rate is 6%

120
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,950
and the euro risk-free rate is 3%,

121
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,070
and finally that the volatility of the dollar-for-euro exchange

122
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,690
rate is 10%.

123
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,870
The results of plugging these assumptions

124
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,920
into the various pricing formulas is shown here.

125
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,680
The most expensive choice is the portfolio

126
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,790
of 12 put options, each with a one-year expiration.

127
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,370
That makes sense because it gives the firm a lot

128
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,980
of upside from the 12 options.

129
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,850
The basket of 12 options with consecutive monthly expiration

130
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,480
dates is less expensive because the options

131
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,080
have a positive theta, meaning that longer-maturity currency

132
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,920
options are worth more than those with a shorter maturity.

133
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,390
Turning to the two Asian option alternatives, one arithmetic

134
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,500
and one geometric, both are significantly less expensive

135
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,800
than the basket of 12 European puts.

136
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,190
Here, we're seeing the effect of the averaging reducing

137
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,970
the volatility of the price that determines the payoff, implying

138
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,090
less upside for the firm but also a lower cost of hedging.

139
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,760
The geometric put is slightly more expensive

140
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,680
than the arithmetic put because the geometric average is lower

141
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,080
than the arithmetic average.

142
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,330
Finally, what about a currency swap?

143
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,750
Remember that a new currency swap has a zero upfront

144
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,420
cost because it's priced to have an equal value

145
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,340
for both counterparties.

146
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,650
It also leaves the firm with no upside.

147
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,720
The swap is actually the only one

148
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,690
of these alternatives that's a pure hedge in that it

149
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,230
eliminates risk completely.

150
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,370
Any of the options-based choices protects against the downside

151
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,940
risk, but it also has a speculative element

152
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,190
because it's a bet that the euro will

153
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,870
depreciate against the dollar.

154
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,580
I bet that some of you are wondering

155
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,700
about how you'd estimate the values of these various options

156
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,820
on your own.

157
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,530
You've learned the formula for pricing

158
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,840
standard European currency options,

159
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,630
and you can use it to confirm the values for the 12

160
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,840
one-year options and also for the basket of options

161
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,510
that are reported here.

162
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,760
Closed form approximation formulas

163
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,210
for geometric Asian options can be found in textbooks

164
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,610
based on Black's model.

165
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,220
You're not responsible, though, for knowing that fairly

166
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,290
complicated formula.

167
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,110
For arithmetic average options, pricing

168
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,080
is typically done using a binomial tree or Monte Carlo

169
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,580
simulation.

170
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,909
We'll go over how to price Asian options with these techniques

171
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,500
later today.

172
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,000
