00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
PROFESSOR: Clearly, for ordinary put and call options,

1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,070
like the ones we just looked at, there's

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,580
no reason to choose Monte Carlo over binomial valuation.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,480
And in fact, the simplest thing to do

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,690
is to use an analytical formula, such as

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,420
the Black-Scholes-Merton model, when you can.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,090
The utility of a Monte Carlo simulation approach

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,970
becomes apparent for exotic derivatives that

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,520
have path dependent payoffs.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,130
That is the value of the option at maturity

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,890
depends on the path taken by the stock

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,260
during the life of the option.

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,340
We saw that agent options are path-dependent because they

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,640
have a payoff that's based on the average of the stock price

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,540
over the life of the option.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,590
It's possible to price these options on a binomial tree.

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,170
But doing so involves some complications

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,990
that are illustrated by this next example

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,870
and that are avoided with Monte Carlo simulation.

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,080


20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,440
This figure shows a 2-step binomial stock price tree

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,650
that we can use to price a European-Asian call

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,610
option with an at the money strike price of 100.

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,120
As usual, the tree will track the stock price over time

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,160
on each node based on the up or down moves we've calculated

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,460
to calibrate the tree.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,500
But now we also need to keep track

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,830
of the average price along every possible path

28
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,220
and the probability of every possible path.

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,320
For example, on the up-up path, the average

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,100
of 100, and 123, and 152.8 give us an average stock price

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,490
of 125.49.

32
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:57,540
Then the call option is in the money by 25.49 at that node.

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,390
Well, the additional complexity arises

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:09,110
with a comparison of the up-down and the down-up situations.

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,310
Although the underlying stock price tree is recombining,

36
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,000
reaching a stock price of 100 in both the up-down

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,640
and the down-up, the average of the stock prices

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,290
is much higher with an up-down than with a down-up,

39
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,010
resulting in a call that's in the money in one case

40
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,880
and out of the money on the other, hence a tree

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,150
representing the averages won't be a recombining

42
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,480
tree and the number of terminal nodes

43
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,660
will grow exponentially with the number of steps

44
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,800
rather than linearly.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,790


46
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,720
We can calculate the probability of reaching each of these four

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,660
possible outcomes for the value of the call option

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,770
at expiration by taking into account the number of up

49
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,800
and down moves along each path.

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,630
For instance, any path with one up and one down

51
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,770
will have a risk neutral probability of q star times 1

52
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,850
minus q star, which will equal 24.91%,

53
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,460
given all the assumptions used to compute this example.

54
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,910
The terminal payoffs at each node

55
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,240
are weighted by their respective probabilities,

56
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,880
then discounted at the risk-free rate,

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,370
and added together to get an Asian option value of 7.45

58
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,360
implied by the tree.

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,190


60
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,630
Well, rather than doing all of this combinatorial calculations

61
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,740
to get the probability of every possible path and its outcome,

62
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,400
it's simpler to just use Monte Carlo simulation.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,370
That will involve simulating a large number of stock price

64
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,920
paths, calculating the average stock

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,470
price along each of those paths, and finding

66
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,010
the corresponding discounted option payoff.

67
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,400
The averages across the discounted payoffs

68
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,390
is the estimate of the options value.

69
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,110
Doing this for a simulation with 100 Monte Carlo runs

70
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:22,860
produces an estimate of 7.56 with a standard error of 0.316,

71
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,900
which is quite close to the value we

72
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:32,760
found using the tree of 7.45.

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,940
I want to take a minute to recap the advantages of Monte Carlo

74
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,240
simulation for valuing path-dependent options

75
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,870
and to illustrate the conclusions graphically.

76
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,380
The top graph here shows the original stock price

77
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,860
paths over 10 Monte Carlo runs.

78
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,950
The lower graph shows the corresponding averages

79
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,560
at each node, which are the relevant asset

80
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,820
values underlying the payoffs on Asian options.

81
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,950
While the original stock price paths

82
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,250
look like the recombining tree that we started with,

83
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,380
the averages look like paths on a non-recombining tree.

84
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,690
Non-recombining trees are much harder

85
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,260
to evaluate numerically for a large number of time steps

86
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,600
because the number of possible outcomes

87
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,670
grows exponentially in the number of times steps.

88
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,730
However, I also want to note that when

89
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,530
a path-dependent derivative is American rather than European,

90
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,700
so that it involves a decision about optimal exercise,

91
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,710
it's more straightforward to go back

92
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,140
to the non-recombining binomial tree

93
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,600
than to try to use Monte Carlo methods.

94
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,510
The reason is that it's quite tricky

95
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,490
to infer the optimal exercise policy with a Monte Carlo.

96
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,650
There are some Monte Carlo approaches

97
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,110
that have been proposed to deal with that added

98
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,420
layer of complexity but those are

99
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,105
beyond the scope of what we're going to look at here.

100
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:02,670


101
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,160
Finally, a reminder that we looked

102
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,500
at several other types of exotic options

103
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,090
that are path dependent.

104
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,080
Those include barrier options of various flavors, loopback

105
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,380
options, and Asian strike options.

106
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,550
Monte Carlo simulation provides a useful tool for valuation

107
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,810
in each of these cases as well.
