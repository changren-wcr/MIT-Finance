00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790


1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,390
PROFESSOR: Let's look at more expectations involving

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,590
our stochastic processes.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:16,590
We know that db is a Gaussian random variable

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,830
with a mean 0 and variance dt.

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,590
We also know that if we integrate

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,540
db from, say, 0 to time t--

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,860
And for convenience, I can write this as bt minus b0.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,860
Let's agree that b0 is going to be 0.

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,910
It will simplify our notation.

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,330
So this I'll just write is bt.

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,250
And we know that this is distributed as n 0t, that

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,440
is, it has variance t.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,500
So since that is the case, we have an easy way

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,020
that we can write things.

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,400
We know that the expectation of d is going to be 0.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,980
We know that its variance is going to be t.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:09,260
So let's just replace the random variable bt, or really,

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,350
bt minus b0, by square root of t times

19
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,310
z, where z doesn't have any time dependence.

20
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,070
z is just n 01.

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,600
So that's just simplifying things and putting everything

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,550
in an even more standard form.

23
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,310
But it also makes explicit the time dependent.

24
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,020
And it's the scaling with time that's

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,350
going to be important for a lot of financial applications,

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,070
and for risk management.

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,310
So, what that means is that any time

28
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,520
where we see a bt, or a bt minus b0,

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
we can replace it by that function.

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,890
So if we want to compute the expectation of some function

31
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,040
of bt minus b0, we can just write

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,830
that the expectation of square root of t times

33
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,810
z, our function of square root of t and z, and compute that.

34
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,310
OK.

35
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,330
And remember these are our Gaussian intervals.

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,830
So we just need to do an integral.

37
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,000
That's all it is.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,580
So this is equal to 1 over square root of 2 pi integral

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,960
from minus infinity to infinity of e

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,070
to the minus z squared over 2 times

41
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,430
f of square root of t times z.

42
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,930
Easy.

43
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,770


44
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,020
So for example, suppose we wanted

45
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,880
to compute the fourth power.

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,660
The expectation of the fourth power.

47
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,630
So suppose that we had f of x is the function x to the fourth.

48
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,240
So we'd like to compute.

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,590
This is an example.

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,100


51
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:03,680
So we'd like to compute f of et minus e0.

52
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,380
That's going to be the expectation of bt minus b0

53
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,690
is to the fourth power.

54
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,290
That's the same thing as expectation

55
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:23,100
of square root of tz raised to the fourth power.

56
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,740


57
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,200
We can pull out square root of t,

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,580
which is nonstochastic to get t squared

59
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,170
times the expectation of z to the 4th, which

60
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,170
is a well-known Gaussian integal that we use in the kurtosis.

61
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,000
It's just equal to 3.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,290
3t squared.

63
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:44,960
All right.

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,300
So this way of standardizing things and writing things

65
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,920
in terms of z when we work in the integral form,

66
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,810
when we integrate our processes, is very convenient.

67
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,280
Let's do an example, and I want to review

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,665
a very useful trick with you.

69
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:02,540
So let's take a look.

70
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,035
So, for example, suppose we do another example.

71
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:10,270


72
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:17,980
Suppose we wanted to compute the expectation of e to the 6x

73
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:26,950
where dx, let's just say it's ordinary Brownian motion, udt

74
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,830
plus sigma db.

75
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,440
So because it's in this form, we can

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:42,095
integrate x, like xt minus x0.

77
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:45,350


78
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:56,190
OK, it's going to be mu times t plus square root of t times z.

79
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:07,180
So if we go to compute the expectation of e to the 6 times

80
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,025
ut plus square root of tz.

81
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:16,850


82
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,760
We could also-- you might see it sometimes in the form

83
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,020
before it's been replaced.

84
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,415
It's just e to the 6 times mu t plus b.

85
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,410


86
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,120
Either way, we'd like to do an integral.

87
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,830
Looking at the first form, obviously e to the six mu t

88
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,780
is just a factor.

89
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,600
It's a scalar, so we can write that-- we can pull that out

90
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,530
in front.

91
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:47,470
6 mu t times the expectation of e to the 6

92
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,350
square root of t times z.

93
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,720
Now in this case, this is a form that we'll see a lot.

94
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,660
I'd like to give you a useful general formula.

95
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,420
That if we'd like to take the expectation of e

96
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,430
to the something, linear and z.

97
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,800
And in fact, we already know what this is.

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,990
Because we already did, in our first lecture,

99
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,310
the characteristic function.

100
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,860
And it's also related to the moment generating function,

101
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,420
e to the something times z.

102
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,670
But let me just connect it with the Gaussian intervals

103
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,580
and remind you of where we got that.

104
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,600
And let's get a useful formula.

105
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,255
So, a useful formula.

106
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:28,700


107
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:34,130
Suppose that we have e to the, let's say, alpha

108
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,110
z plus b, plus beta.

109
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,030
So, some linear function.

110
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,460
So, I would like to compute the expectation of some exponential

111
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,020
of a linear function of z.

112
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,200
And this shows up a lot in particular in asset

113
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,500
pricing formulas.

114
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,620
So this is clearly equal to e to the beta,

115
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,940
because that's just a pre factor.

116
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,570
Times e to the alpha z.

117
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,180
And this we do by doing the Gaussian integral,

118
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,790
with the trick of completing the square in the exponent.

119
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:13,010
So this is 1 over 2 pi e to the minus z squared over 2 times

120
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,330
e to the alpha z dz.

121
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,060
That's just our definition for the expectation operator.

122
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,550
And of course I had the e to the beta in front,

123
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,600
so let's not lose that.

124
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,190
So inside the integral, what I can

125
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,590
do in the integrand is I can write this as,

126
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,555
let's keep our prefactory e to the beta

127
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:34,520
over square root of 2 pi.

128
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,920
And I can write this as e to the minus z minus alpha

129
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,250
to the quantity squared over 2.

130
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,880
Now you notice if we expand this, I'll get minus e

131
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,500
squared over 2.

132
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,340
I'll get minus minus alpha z times 2

133
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,930
over 2, which is exactly the coefficient with the weighting

134
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,117
that I need over here.

135
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,450
But then there's an extra piece.

136
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,670
There's an alpha squared over 2.

137
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,710
So let's correct for that.

138
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:13,800
Let's put in our integral, and let's write this as plus alpha

139
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:21,490
squared over 2 times dz.

140
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:28,390
But this expression is e to the beta plus alpha squared over

141
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:35,715
2 times 1 over square root of 2 pi integral

142
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:41,850
e to the minus z minus alpha quantity squared over 2 dz.

143
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,640


144
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,730
And because the integral goes from minus infinity

145
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,540
to infinity, the difference in the exponential between z

146
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,060
and z minus alpha makes no difference at all.

147
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,850
If you'd like, you can shift the variable of integration.

148
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,070
The integral inside the square brackets

149
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,190
with 1 over square root of 2 pi in front is equal to 1.

150
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,970
So our final result, our final useful formula,

151
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:12,590
is that the expectation of e to the alpha z plus beta,

152
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,380
for any alpha and beta that are constant,

153
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:22,810
is going to be e to the alpha squared over 2 plus beta.

154
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,550
Now, let's apply that to our example.

155
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:33,380
We had-- this is our useful formula.

156
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,900


157
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,960
And our example was the exponential of e

158
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:52,840
to the 6x was expectation of e to the 6 mu t

159
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,470
plus 6 square root of t times z.

160
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,320
So applying our formula, this is going

161
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,220
to give me e to the 6 mu t plus the square

162
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,810
of the coefficient of z.

163
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,080
That's going to be 6 times square root of t divided by 2.

164
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,860
So 6 squared over 2.

165
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,830
6 squared Is 36, over 2 is 18.

166
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,800
And square root of t squared is t.

167
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,890


168
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,580
And there's my answer for my expectation.

169
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,470
Yes, except we left out one coefficient,

170
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,900
which was the sigma squared.

171
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,880


172
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,160
So, this is my mistake.

173
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,430
If you didn't catch the sigma squared, I hope you did.

174
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,382
Because t should always come in with the sigma

175
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:49,340
squared in front of it.

176
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,590
But let's go back and fix my formulas.

177
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,130
There should have been a--

178
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:01,440
we began here with mu t plus sigma, square root of t.

179
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,160
There should have been a sigma square root of t there.

180
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,080
We have a sigma b here.

181
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,870
This should have had a sigma here.

182
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,590


183
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,960
And then as we come down here, we needed a sigma here.

184
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,570
And then keep in mind that our expression

185
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,010
was to take this quantity in the red parentheses squared

186
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,150
divided by 2.

187
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,460
That's our alpha that we see over here.

188
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,600
So I apologize for the typo, but I hope

189
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,250
you caught it before I did.

190
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,590
So this is 6 squared over 2 is 18.

191
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,350
Square root of t is t.

192
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,150
And sigma squared is sigma squared.

193
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,470
So there's our answer for finding this expectation.

194
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,990
And this works, generally, for a larger class

195
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,170
of functions that show up for different kinds of Ito

196
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,020
processes.
