00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100


1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,920
PROFESSOR: Let's take a closer look at the diffusion equation.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,390
So the general diffusion equation is given right here.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,320
So we say that we have a function p of z and t,

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,880
and they need to satisfy this differential equation.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,910
The first partial with respect to t

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,590
minus half the second partial with respect to z equals 0.

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,980
And we've seen that there's a very special solution, p0,

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,960
that satisfies that equation, which

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,810
we can find by plugging it in and taking some derivatives.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,479
So here's our p0.

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,820
Now, I claimed that if we construct this integral on top,

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,560
that this is the solution to the equation.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,830
So what I'd like to do is, let's check that,

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,700
and then let's apply it.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,710
So the first thing to do is to check it.

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,520
And the way we do it is we take derivatives.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,040
And what we find is that if we take that integral expression,

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,220
and we stick it into the differential equation, what

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,550
we'll do is, we'll move the differential operators inside.

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:08,820
So for example, the partial derivative

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,980
with respect to time of p of z and t

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:19,170
is the integral of the partial with respect to--

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,460
excuse me-- the partial with respect

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:36,150
to time of everything inside the integral P0 z minus wt f of w,

25
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,650
dw.

26
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,340


27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,870
But where is the t dependence?

28
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,790
The t dependence is only in one place.

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,500
It's in p0.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,250
And similarly with the second derivative.

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,090
So if I take the differential operator, partial with respect

32
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:59,960
to t minus 1/2 second partial with respect to z squared,

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,620
and I act on p, then that's the same thing

34
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:11,620
as this differential operator partial of t minus 1/2

35
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,540
second partial with respect to--

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,540


37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,220
let me get our pens right--

38
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,850
z squared, times-- what are they going to act on?

39
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,934
Well, the only thing that depends on z and t is p0.

40
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:35,020
p0 z and t--

41
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,620
excuse me.

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,410


43
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,490
z minus w t of w, tw.

44
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,390
The only potential complication that we'd have to worry about

45
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,180
is this derivative act here on this t.

46
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,360
This is derivatives with respect to z.

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,170
This is not p0 of z and t, it's z minus w.

48
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,170
But because it's just shifted by a constant,

49
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,390
the derivatives are exactly the same.

50
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,050
So this operator, when I move it inside the integral,

51
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,680
acting on this part of the integrand gives 0.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,780
And it doesn't matter what f is.

53
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,660
The integral is always going to be 0, provided

54
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,100
that the intervals converge.

55
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,580
And they will converge whenever t is greater than 0.

56
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,190
The limit t goes to 0 is a special case.

57
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,260
And we'll have more to say about that.

58
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,840
This is the reason why this integral form works.

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,020
So the reason it works is that, whenever

60
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,080
I act with the differential operator,

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,110
this piece here is the only thing that's hit,

62
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,370
and it vanishes.

63
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,150
So this expression necessarily solves

64
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,780
the differential equation.

65
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,020
If in addition, I get something that

66
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,110
has the right initial conditions, then I'm done.

67
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,600
I know that it satisfies the initial conditions.

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,510
I know that it satisfies the differential equation.

69
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,900
That's all we need to know.

70
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,110
So let's do a couple examples.

71
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:12,650
So exercise.

72
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,670
Suppose that f of z is z squared.

73
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,730
So this was an example that we did a lecture.

74
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,720
So I have the p of z comma 0 is equal to z squared.

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:36,280
And I say, find p of zt, or t in general,

76
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,760
at least for positive values of t.

77
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,700
So take a moment and go do that.

78
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,192
Take a look at the internals.

79
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:45,400
And then, we'll come back and we'll do that together.

80
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:56,920


81
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,670
OK.

82
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,570
Let's go.

83
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,770
Do you have an answer?

84
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,812
All right, well you probably have the same answer

85
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:04,570
that we had in lecture.

86
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,110
But let's do the integrals.

87
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,590
So what we need to do is, we've got a formula.

88
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,020
Let's just plug and chug.

89
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,910
So p of zt is going to be equal to the integral of 1

90
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,540
over square root of 2 pi, e to the minus z

91
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,290
minus w squared over 2t.

92
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,360
I should have put in a t down here.

93
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,040
Remember, it's a Gaussian where the variance is t.

94
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,780
So it's not completely standardized.

95
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,825
So there is t dependence in this.

96
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:39,200
And then, what we'd like to do is

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:47,250
multiply this times w squared tw.

98
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,090
So that's the integral that we'd like to do.

99
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,490
How do we do this integral?

100
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,300
Well, let's change variables.

101
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,230
So what we'd like to do is, let's simplify the exponent

102
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,420
and pick a new variable.

103
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:07,910
So let's let u be equal to w minus z divided

104
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,400
by square root of t.

105
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,250
That way, the thing in the exponential

106
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,240
up here is going to be e to the minus u squared over 2.

107
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,410
And that'll be a very simple form.

108
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,590
Then, because we have this differential form--

109
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,200
because we have this form for u, We also

110
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,230
have the du is going to be dw over square root of t.

111
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,702
But that's pretty good, because we have a dw right here,

112
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:35,410
and we have a square root of t down here.

113
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,550
So those are going to combine very nicely.

114
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,030
So let's make those substitutions.

115
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,480


116
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,730
And we'll see that p of z is going

117
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,000
to be equal to 1 over square root of 2

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,800
pi times the integral of e to the minus

119
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,070
u squared over 2 times--

120
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,380
we need a w squared.

121
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,260
Well, w-- if this is my expression for u,

122
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,690
then w is going to be u times square root of t plus z.

123
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,320
So let's write that out.

124
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:21,440
This is going to be u times square root of t, plus z.

125
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,980
Then we have that quantity squared du.

126
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,600
Well, that's pretty easy.

127
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,160
Because now we almost have things in standardized form

128
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
for a Gaussian interval.

129
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,740
And this goes from minus infinity to infinity.

130
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,550
So this is going to be 1 over square root of 2 pi integral

131
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,400
from minus infinity to infinity, e

132
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,060
to the minus u squared, times--

133
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,010
let's just expand that out.

134
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:56,870
We're going to have u squared times t plus 2u square root

135
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:05,720
of t times z plus z squared du.

136
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,080
Let's look at each of these terms.

137
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,290
The first term, right here, is going to be u squared times t.

138
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,720
Remember, t is a constant with respect

139
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,560
to the variable of integration.

140
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,180
So this is going to give us--

141
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,790
a first term will be t times 1 over square root of 2

142
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:33,510
pi integral should be over 2, e to the minus 2 squared over 2,

143
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,469
u squared du.

144
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:43,200
The second term, right here, is going to vanish.

145
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,980
Because it's linear in u, this is an even function in u.

146
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,160
We're going from minus infinity to infinity.

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,945
And even functions-- excuse me, odd functions

148
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:57,570
are going to have varnishing integrals.

149
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,257
It's just a plus sign to the minus sign

150
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:00,910
are going to cancel each other out.

151
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,630
And then, the last term, z squared that we have right

152
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,680
here, that's just a constant.

153
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:15,440
So we have plus z squared times 1

154
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,250
over square root of 2 pi, integral e to the minus u

155
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,750
squared over 2 du, without anything else.

156
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,880
Well, this expression is equal to 1.

157
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,140
And so is this expression.

158
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,810
Because this is just the variance

159
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,670
of the standardized Gaussian distribution.

160
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,920
So we do the integrals.

161
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,060
And what we're left with is z squared plus t.

162
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,460
And we can check that it satisfies our differential

163
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,550
equation.

164
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:52,560
If we take the partial of p with respect to t, we get 1.

165
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,270
If we take the second partial--

166
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,790
1/2 the second partial with respect to z squared, we get 1.

167
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,100
And if we subtract the two of them, we get 0.

168
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,160
So we're done.

169
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,000
So this is the answer.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,900
Let's do one more exercise.

171
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,670
Slightly different version of the one that we did in lecture.

172
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,790
But now, don't refer back to the lecture.

173
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,160
Just take a look at what we've done for the integrals.

174
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,950
And do this one yourself.

175
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:27,160
So what I'd like to do is introduce the Gaussian

176
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,840
cumulative distribution function,

177
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,770
which is going to be useful and show up in a few places.

178
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,230
I will call this phi of x.

179
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:43,320
It's going to be defined as the integral of e to the minus z

180
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:50,810
squared over 2 dz, from minus infinity up to x.

181
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,660
So I compute the left side of the integral

182
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,940
of the bell curve for the Gaussian distribution

183
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,600
up to some point x.

184
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,030
So in terms of Gaussian probabilities,

185
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,530
this is the same thing as the probability

186
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,830
that a Gaussian random variable z is less

187
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,940
than some particular value x.

188
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,960
Now, from the fundamental theorem of calculus of course,

189
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:26,380
I know that d by dx phi of x is just e to the minus x

190
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,970
squared over 2.

191
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,580
So I can differentiate or I can integrate.

192
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,670
I can go back and forth.

193
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,240
But this basic idea that it's an incomplete integral.

194
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,910
So I integrate from minus infinity

195
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,150
up to a particular value x that's defined out here.

196
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,800
It's going to be useful, and we'll

197
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,930
see that it shows up in a bunch of places.

198
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,100
Here's a really simple example.

199
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,880
So exercise.

200
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,920


201
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:02,630
Let's let f of w equal 1 for w less than kappa,

202
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:08,770
and 0 for w greater than kappa.

203
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:15,230
So the question is, find p of zt,

204
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:23,530
where remember that this is p and z a time 0.

205
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,960
So at time 0, it's a step function.

206
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,490
It's either 0 or 1 depending on the value of its argument.

207
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:41,100
I apologize, this should be a w in that case.

208
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,870
So what we'd like to do is, we want to find p of zt

209
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,460
for the general case.

210
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,920
So take a moment, see if you can work it out

211
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,710
from our general definition.

212
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,220
Remember that our definition is, we integrate p0

213
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,700
against p0 evaluated at z minus w against the function f of w.

214
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,240
And we integrate that over w in an explicit expression

215
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,860
in terms of z.

216
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,490
Go take a moment to do that.

217
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,365
And then, we'll take a look at this together.

218
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:21,180


219
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,750
OK?

220
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,290
Let's go.

221
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,030
Let's just work from the definition.

222
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,160
The reason why this is particularly nice

223
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,010
is the integrand is either 1 or 0.

224
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,810
So there's an interesting generalization

225
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,940
that's important for the Black-Scholes case, where

226
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,910
we might-- instead of 1 or 0, we might

227
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,350
like to let it be 0 in the lower case, but kappa minus w

228
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,453
in the upper case.

229
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,870
So after you've done this one, I'd

230
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,837
suggest trying that one as an extension.

231
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:46,420
But this one's fairly straightforward.

232
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,210
So let's do this one together just

233
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,640
to make sure we've got the concepts and our definitions

234
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,330
of the integral.

235
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,100


236
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,580
So this is going to be integral of 1 over the square root of 2

237
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:09,270
pi t, e to the minus z minus w quantity squared over 2, dw--

238
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,390
now, the integrand is either 0 or 1.

239
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,940
So if it were 1, we would be done.

240
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,930
But because it's 0 for large values of w, for w

241
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,360
greater than kappa, our integral is only

242
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,000
going to go from minus infinity up to kappa.

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,970
So that's it.

244
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,910
So now you can recognize that apart

245
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,640
from the shift in the exponent-- and sorry,

246
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,310
I put my omissions in red.

247
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,610
There should be a t here just to match the t that's down here.

248
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,300
So now we need to do the Gaussian integral.

249
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:50,010
And as a function of kappa, what are we going to get?

250
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,563
So let's do the integral.

251
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:52,980
And the way we can do the integral

252
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,390
is, we can make the same change of variables as last time.

253
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:05,300
So let's let u equal w minus z over square root of t.

254
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:12,440
Implies that we have du is going to be dw over square root of t.

255
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,540
That's going to work the same as before.

256
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,970
In addition, our upper limit of integration is w equals kappa.

257
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,890
And that's going to translate into an upper limit of u

258
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:30,260
is going to be kappa minus z over square root of t.

259
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,350


260
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,300
So let's call that u star perhaps,

261
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,210
for upper limit of integration.

262
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:44,610
So now, we have making that change of variables.

263
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,170
p of zt is going to be the integral from minus

264
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,570
infinity up to kappa minus z over square root of t,

265
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,770
times 1 over square root of 2 pi, e

266
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,730
to the minus u squared over 2, du.

267
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,760
Now, there are no more t's in the integrand.

268
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,560
Everything in terms of a new variable

269
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,110
of integration, a dummy variable u.

270
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,930
And this is our definition of our function phi.

271
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:21,560
So this is now equal to phi kappa minus z, divided

272
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,780
by square root of t, which is a very well behaved function

273
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,210
for positive values of t.

274
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,960
And it would be interesting to take a look

275
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,420
and plot this as t goes to 0.

276
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,090
But right now, we have the result that we saw it.

277
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,685
And we can check this, again, by differentiating and putting it

278
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:44,180
into the differential equation, and verifying that it satisfies

279
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,190
the equation, and verifying that it

280
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,610
satisfies the initial conditions a t equals 0.

281
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,560
Which as I said, it requires taking a limit,

282
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,810
because we can't immediately set t equals 0

283
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,500
in this case in the way we did previously.

284
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,000
