1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,600
PROFESSOR: Let's talk more about ito processes and Ito's lemma.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,860
So we know that an ito process is a stochastic process that

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,920
can be described in differential form

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,800
by an expression of the type dx is adt plus bdB.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,750
And we think of this as something

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,560
that tells us what happens between a time interval dt.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,770
That's why we think of the dt part as being deterministic.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,110
The coefficient functions a and b

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,970
are evaluated at the starting point,

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,030
or evaluated at a time, t, for value x.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,890
And that we assume is known.

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,390
What we want to know is what happens

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,160
during the next interval dt.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,640
What's the new increment to x, dx that gets added on?

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,950
So in that sense, the a and b are coefficient functions

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,990
and the randomness is all in dB.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,870
And we know the nice properties of dB,

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,520
of our Brownian increment.

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,880
We know that this is a normal random variable with mean 0

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,190
and variance dt.

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:09,020
Now Ito's lemma tells us how we can take these functions of x,

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,530
where x is generally not differentiable,

23
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,830
but F is a differentiable function of t and x,

24
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,670
and how we can find out how it behaves, how it evolved.

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,270
And I've shown you two ways of framing it.

26
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,390
And I'd like to sort of add a third hybrid way that

27
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,470
can also be useful.

28
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,335
It doesn't really add anything new,

29
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:30,460
but it's another thing to keep in mind because it's

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,160
an extra approach for solving different kinds of problems.

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,220
So remember that we saw that we can write things

32
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,170
in differential form.

33
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,400
And in certain cases, we can also integrate explicitly.

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,780
In particular, when the left and right hand side

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,350
do total differentials, we can write things out

36
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,850
in explicit form.

37
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,965
So let's take a look at an example

38
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:53,720
and just go through the different ways

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,030
that we can write dF.

40
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,470
So this is one of them.

41
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,400


42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,900
So this is one of them where I write

43
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,300
things in terms of dt and dx.

44
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,870
And as we've seen in our derivations of Ito's lemma,

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,140
this is particularly convenient when the dx's are

46
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,860
going to cancel each other out.

47
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,300
So in this case, we think of writing the two functions

48
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,290
in square brackets that begin with F. They all

49
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,117
depend on derivatives of F. F is a function of t

50
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:25,990
and x, so we think of the square brackets

51
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,870
and writing them out as functions of t And x.

52
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,590
And that's just fine.

53
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,310
So from this point of view, the one other way

54
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,200
we might choose to write it is to take our expression for dx

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,650
and simplify, or expand depending

56
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,830
on how you look at it, by substituting in this value

57
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,220
here for dx, in which case, we have

58
00:02:48,220 --> 00:03:09,550
our alternate expression where we can write this as dF equals

59
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,680
partial of F with respect to t plus b squared over 2,

60
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,780
our ito term, d2F dx squared.

61
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,570
And now we'll replace our dx by its definition.

62
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,980
So we'll include another term, this

63
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:34,900
plus a partial of F with respect to x times dt

64
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:43,610
plus b partial of F with respect to x plus dB.

65
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:50,410
So all I did was I expanded this term by substituting

66
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,840
what we had here, OK?

67
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,950
So in the top form, it's useful when we want to cancel the x's.

68
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,140
In the bottom form, it's useful when

69
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,840
we want to look at an ito process on its own.

70
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,750
And it's helpful to break things down to its lowest components

71
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,020
because dB is normally standardized.

72
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,450
Dx, that we have on the line above,

73
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,100
isn't necessarily standardized.

74
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,900
So depending on what we'd like to do,

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,870
we have different applications that might be useful.

76
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,709
The third thing I wanted to add, though,

77
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,130
is that sometimes, we'd like to express

78
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,770
the coefficient functions in the square brackets,

79
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,060
not in terms of t and x, but in terms of t and F.

80
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,180
That is, we'd like to have a complete replacement,

81
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,200
a complete transformation of the variable from x into F.

82
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,540
And in certain cases, that will be possible.

83
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,090
In some other cases, it won't.

84
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,720
So let's take a look at an example

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,930
that we can write in three different ways.

86
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,740
Exercise.

87
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,780
Let's let dx evolve according to ux dt plus sigma x dB.

88
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,540
So our coefficient functions a and b in this case

89
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,130
are replaced by the definite values

90
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,710
that we've seen in this familiar form.

91
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,600
Little a is equal to mu times x.

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,550
Little b is equal to sigma times x.

93
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,210
And let's suppose that we have a function F which is equal to e

94
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,425
to the minus rt where r is a constant--

95
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:11,050
think of it as being a risk free rate--

96
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,860
times x squared.

97
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,830
So here's the exercise.

98
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,900
Write out df in three different ways.

99
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,290
Write it first as a function of something dt plus something dx.

100
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,070
Then write it is something dt plus something dB.

101
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,850
And then, finally, write it again as something dt plus

102
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,800
something dB, but this time, without any explicit x's.

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,260
See if you can write it strictly in terms of F. And if you can,

104
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,520
what kind of interpretation does it have?

105
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,917
Take a moment to look at that, to work it out, and then

106
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,500
come back and we'll solve it together.

107
00:05:49,500 --> 00:06:02,810


108
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,510
All right, let's begin by taking partial derivatives, shall we?

109
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:24,990
So we know that equal to e to the minus rt times x squared.

110
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:31,550
So partial of F with respect to t is going to be minus r

111
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:37,910
e to the minus rt times x squared partial of F

112
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,860
with respect to x.

113
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,740
It's going to be e to the minus rt times 2x.

114
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,120
And the second partial derivative

115
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,260
of F with respect to x squared is

116
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,030
going to be simply twice e to the minus rt.

117
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,480
So let's take these results and put them

118
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,120
into our formula for Ito's lemma.

119
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,960
So we have the df in our first expression

120
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,870
is going to be partial of F with respect to t.

121
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:21,590
That's going to give us a minus r e to the minus rt x squared

122
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,730
plus b squared over 2, which is going

123
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,290
to be sigma x quantity squared over 2 times

124
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,900
the second partial derivative with respect

125
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,360
to x squared, which is going to be times 2 e to the minus rt.

126
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,910


127
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,480
This is the expression that multiplies dt.

128
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,150
Plus, the coefficient for dB is simpler

129
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,760
because it's just the first partial with respect to x.

130
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:59,410
So it's e to the minus RT times 2x dx.

131
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,590
So if we simplify terms a little bit,

132
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,030
we notice that everything gets multiplied by an e

133
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,630
to the minus rt, so we could take that out in front

134
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,760
if we like.

135
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,010
Each of the terms will have an e to the minus rt.

136
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,880


137
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:23,040
Now we know this it's going to have an x squared times

138
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:30,400
minus r plus sigma squared dt.

139
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,919
That is, we notice there's an x squared here

140
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,490
and there's an x squared here that came from our ito term.

141
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,080
And there's no x over there.

142
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,409
So I have an x squared and an x squared.

143
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,780
We're minus r from taking the derivative.

144
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,260
And sigma squared over 2 multiplied by 2,

145
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,780
which just gives me sigma squared.

146
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:55,290
In the second term, it's going to be just as easy.

147
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,160


148
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:09,335
So it's going to be plus e to the minus rt times 2x dx.

149
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:13,200


150
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,750
Now at this point, we can make an interesting observation

151
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,000
for that third form that we had.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,990
Notice that the first line in our result right

153
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,520
here is a combination e to the minus rt and x squared.

154
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,680
But that's just the same as F.

155
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:36,990
So let's go ahead and rewrite this as F times sigma squared

156
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,640
minus r dt.

157
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,178
That's our first term.

158
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:44,470
And what about the second term?

159
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,290
Well, this is not equal to F. But suppose

160
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,520
that we multiply and divide by x.

161
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:06,180
In that case, we could write this as plus 2 F times dx

162
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,890
over x.

163
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,750
So what I've done is I've multiplied and divided.

164
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,150
In this line, I've multiplied this by x,

165
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,410
and I've divided this by x.

166
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,840
Now you notice I have F times something dt plus F

167
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,050
times dx over x.

168
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,580
And here, I can substitute back my original definition.

169
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,440
So let's keep going.

170
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,410
So this is going to be F times sigma squared

171
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:43,050
minus r dt plus 2F times dx over x,

172
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:49,415
which was mu dt plus sigma dB.

173
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,760


174
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,510
Let's combine these.

175
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:01,800
And this is our dt term is going to be

176
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:19,870
F times sigma squared minus r plus 2mu dt plus 2F sigma dB.

177
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:28,290
In other words, we could write this as dF over F

178
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:41,850
is equal to 2mu plus sigma squared minus r dt plus 2 sigma

179
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,110
dB.

180
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:50,190
So you notice that this form here for the ito process just

181
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,700
involves F. There are no explicit x's.

182
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,320
The way the x's entered was exactly in the right way that

183
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,770
we could group them together to make them into F's.

184
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,900
Now that worked because of the particular form

185
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,940
we chose for our ito process, but that's

186
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,990
a very common process, and it's a very useful form.

187
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,010
So in this case, I have an expression for dF written

188
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,580
in terms of dt plus dB, so we can see it's an ito process,

189
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,800
but there are no explicit x's.

190
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,630
We've changed variables completely,

191
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,050
so everything instead of depending on t and x,

192
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,910
now it depends on t and F. And, of course, our middle

193
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,260
form we can get just by doing our usual substitution

194
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,900
by writing out dx here and expanding the rest of the way.

195
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:50,900
And the values, we would have dF is going to be--

196
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,610
keeping everything in terms of the x's

197
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,665
and the partial derivatives that we had--

198
00:12:54,665 --> 00:13:01,750
e to the minus rt x squared times minus r

199
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,250
plus sigma squared plus 2mu dt.

200
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,860


201
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,360
Let's see.

202
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,650
I think I need another parenthesis here somewhere.

203
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,920
Let's try putting one there.

204
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:23,070
OK, plus 2 sigma e to the minus rt x squared dB.

205
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,680
So just to make that clear, this is

206
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,650
something dt plus something dB.

207
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,860
And in this case, the coefficient functions of dt

208
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,410
and dB are just in terms of x's.

209
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,400
So if I were combining multiple things

210
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,950
and I had different versions of x,

211
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,930
this might be more convenient form.

212
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,190
If I wanted to study f on its own and ask how does f behave,

213
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,980
the line above, this one in the box,

214
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,810
might be easier to integrate.

215
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,210
So all of these are valid forms.

216
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,310
And in each case, all we need to do

217
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,340
is apply the rules for Ito's lemma, take the derivatives,

218
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,540
and substitute them in.

219
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,570
Which way we regroup them together and what's useful

220
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,940
is going to depend on the application that you have.

221
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,180


222
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,970
Just as one final extension of this,

223
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,990
if we wanted to go all the way and integrate the process F,

224
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,300
we could do the game that we did before where

225
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,030
now the expression in the box looks exactly

226
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,450
like the kind of expression that we had for geometric Brownian

227
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,110
motion.

228
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,230
DF over F is some constant times dt

229
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,450
plus some other constant times dB.

230
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,780
We'd look for the differential of log F. We know that that's

231
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,460
going to take this form, and we're

232
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,290
going to shift by the square of 2 sigma in the drift term

233
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,700
and get another expression.

234
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,067
And that would be integral.

235
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,150
There's another shorthand way that we could do it,

236
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,620
too, which is to use our definition of F

237
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,340
inside the differential.

238
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:59,810
So if we were to ask for d of log F,

239
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:05,780
we could use Ito's lemma on that process dF over F. Or are we

240
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:12,020
could say, well, this is just d of logarithm of e

241
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,240
to the minus rt times x squared.

242
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,410
And that's an ordinary function.

243
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,860
We could do that logarithm that says that this is d of minus rt

244
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:33,980
plus twice log X. And that tells us that this is minus r dt

245
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:42,350
plus twice d of log X. And we know what d of log X is.

246
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,950
And if we substitute in, we find the same result. OK,

247
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:53,620
we find that this is going to be equal to 2mu minus

248
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:02,370
sigma squared minus r dt plus 2 sigma dB.

249
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,240
Two ways of getting the same answer.
