1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,350
PROFESSOR: Now let's look at using the Ito calculus

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,010
and the tools of continuous time finance in setting

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,720
of fixed-income modeling.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,730
So far, we've looked mostly at the classic examples of stock

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,280
as a random continuous time process,

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,680
looking at the evolution of the stock price,

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,870
and we've looked at derivative pricing in terms

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,030
of an option on the stock.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,170
When we go to the world of bonds,

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,910
we'll find a bunch of interesting things.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,610
First of all, interest rates are dynamic.

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,320
Now, when we saw interest rates in looking at stock options

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,150
and deriving the Black-Scholes equation,

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,120
there was a single variable r, which

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,180
was held to be a constant, the risk-free rate.

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,670
In fact, interest rates change over time,

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,580
and interest rates change over time unpredictably.

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,530
So they're in fact random variables, not just parameters.

19
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,120
Interest rates aren't tradable.

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,510
So although we'll have a random driver that, in many ways,

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,330
will have the same properties and same kind of Ito

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,940
description as we had for stock prices,

23
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,010
our hedging arguments won't necessarily

24
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,350
go through the same way, because we can't trade

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,640
interest rates themselves.

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,350
Interest rates are the term structure.

27
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,230
That is, there are different interest rates associated

28
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,430
with different maturities of bonds and, of course,

29
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,130
different levels of creditworthiness.

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,580
So even if we're looking at risk-free bonds that

31
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,540
have no default risk, they may still have risk in the sense

32
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,700
that market rates, interest rates can vary.

33
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,850
There's a term structure.

34
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,820
So we don't find the same interest rate

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,090
on a one-year bond, a two-year bond, and a 30-year bond.

36
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,970
These term structures themselves change over time.

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,090
And they're a very important subject for modeling.

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,620
And they not only change over time,

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,120
but they do so in ways that are unpredictable.

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,730
So it's natural to model the entire curve not just

41
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,800
a single point or a single interest rate

42
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,240
as being stochastic.

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,140
The bond prices are determined in relation

44
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,400
to these interest rates.

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,199
But there may be a lot of bonds associated with a single rate

46
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,220
or with a particular set of rates.

47
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,010
So there are many interrelationships

48
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,660
among the different interest rates

49
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,250
and across the entire yield curve.

50
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,950
And interest rate derivatives on futures, bond options, interest

51
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,480
rate swaps--

52
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,160
a whole variety of other derivative contracts

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,415
depend on all of these features.

54
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:35,110
So here's a snapshot just taken from Bloomberg

55
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,820
of a bunch of US securities.

56
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,010
And we see that there are securities that trade.

57
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,570
They have different interest rates.

58
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,740
They're quoted in price.

59
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,390
They're quoted in yield terms.

60
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,520
They're quoted with different expirations.

61
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,840
And we can find this across various sovereign debt markets.

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,700
And of course, the corporate market is even larger.

63
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,730
Here's an example of what I meant by the yield curve.

64
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,130
We're looking at the interest rate, the yield to maturity,

65
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,200
for US bonds.

66
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,170
And this curve shows us the interest rate

67
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,660
in percent on the y-axis against the term

68
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,910
or tenor on the x-axis.

69
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,180
So we see a characteristic shape where

70
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,490
things are rising over time.

71
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,220
We get higher interest rates if we go farther out.

72
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,680
But also notice, there's some curvage area here.

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,880
We're convex here, and we become concave.

74
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,690
There's a point of inflection.

75
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,900
If I look at a different point in time--

76
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,750
for example, I look at a point one year prior

77
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,200
or a month prior, I might see a different shape

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,920
and a different level.

79
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,660
So this curve up here, notice, is downward-sloping.

80
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,240
It's an inverted curve at the beginning, and then it rises.

81
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,050
So all of these rates are higher than the ones down below.

82
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,600
So the curve is moved up.

83
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,050
But it's also changed in shape, and it's changed in direction.

84
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,050
So what are some features that are

85
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,590
consistent with basic principles of finance?

86
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,840
What are the mathematical tools we have to describe them?

87
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
And then, what kinds of predictions can we make?

88
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,380
That's a subject of fixed-income modeling.

89
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,760
And we can pick different kinds of variables,

90
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,610
which may be closely associated, but may

91
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,860
have different interpretations.

92
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,618
Now, suppose we want to take a look at how to price bonds

93
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:27,160
in the same way that we looked at how

94
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,410
to price stock options already.

95
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,870
Now, the pricing of bonds has a few twists.

96
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,850
First of all, which interest rate should we use?

97
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,040
What should they depend on?

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,200
There's not a single risk-free rate

99
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,300
that showed up in our calculations

100
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,700
before that we could use for discounting

101
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,715
or for risk-neutral pricing.

102
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:49,750
Now, risk-free bonds of different maturities

103
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,130
all could lay an equal claim to being the risk-free rate.

104
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,890
It's tempting to take a look at the short rate, the shortest

105
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,840
maturity bonds, but--

106
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,360
because they seem to be special because they're

107
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,150
at one end of the curve rather than some arbitrary

108
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,260
point in the middle.

109
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,350
But really, between any two points in the curve,

110
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,620
we can ask what a view that represents for how rates

111
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,120
might evolve in the future.

112
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,987
And they all contribute to our notion

113
00:05:14,987 --> 00:05:16,570
of what we should think about as being

114
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,990
the relevant risk-free rate, especially when we

115
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,340
have multi-period problems or multiple time horizons.

116
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,590
We can't just content ourselves with picking

117
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,960
a short overnight rate saying that's it;

118
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,620
let's be done with it.

119
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,070
So interest rates aren't constant in time.

120
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,840
They're not deterministic.

121
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,420
We do need to model them as random variables.

122
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,520
But we also need to keep in mind that what

123
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,930
gets traded are bonds, are generally bonds, or derivatives

124
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,390
on bonds or on interest rates, but not the interest rates

125
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:49,960
themselves.

126
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,700
Those can't be traded.

127
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,320
So the bonds come in-- and I'll talk mostly about bonds.

128
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,590
But bonds come in a variety of maturities.

129
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,620
And because we have multiple instruments all trading based

130
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,280
on the same kind of principles, we

131
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,550
might expect there to be some no-arbitrage constraints

132
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,270
on the relative prices of bond.

133
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,910
So here's an idea.

134
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,280
What we'd like to do is look for a way to price all bonds,

135
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,220
or all bonds from a particular class,

136
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,140
of all maturities in a way that avoids arbitrage and that

137
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,950
minimizes or leads to a fixed number of stochastic factors.

138
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,830
We could try to model each bond independently,

139
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,660
but that would not be a great description of reality

140
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,090
because they do have commonalities.

141
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,930
But also, we really want to be able to take advantage

142
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,440
in thinking about portfolios and thinking about possibilities

143
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,390
for arbitrage and how no arbitrage

144
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,540
can inform pricing relationships, about how

145
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,080
the bonds that are connected to common rates,

146
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,580
they have relationships among them.

147
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,600
So let's take a look at the simplest example.

148
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,990
We're going to imagine that we have bonds that do depend

149
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,940
on a single, random variable.

150
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,710
And that random variable, we'll say

151
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,960
will be what we call the short rate, which

152
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,900
is a-- think of not just as being an overnight rate,

153
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,380
but as being an instantaneous spot interest

154
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,090
rate, the rate we can get right now for infinitesimal duration.

155
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,250
So this isn't tradable.

156
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,160
You can't buy it.

157
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,500
You can't buy a bond for that.

158
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,910
You can't invest in it.

159
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,110
But it's kind of clear that it might be approximately

160
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,260
equal to what we would see for very short-term, say,

161
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,440
overnight rates.

162
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,410
So let's think that that might be

163
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,740
one of the variables of interest in describing our yield curve

164
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,232
and describing bonds, certainly, what

165
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:49,940
they're worth a very short period of time

166
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,740
would inform arbitrages.

167
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,960
So let's imagine that we have a variable

168
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,550
that we'll call y for the short term--

169
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,080
this short instantaneous rate.

170
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,910
So let's think that we want to have a pricing formula where

171
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,780
we have the price of a bond; let's call it V.

172
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,160
It depends on time.

173
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,540
It depends on the current time.

174
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,043
It depends on big T--

175
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:17,710
I'll let it be the maturity of the bond.

176
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,210
So let's think of that as being a fixed time in the future.

177
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,080
It's a parameter of the bond; it's not a variable.

178
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,070
And y, little y where I've written a subscript t

179
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,530
to remind us that it's time dependent-- to be

180
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,120
our random variable.

181
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,030
And let's let y be described by an Ito process.

182
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:41,000
So dy is something of the form a dt plus bdB.

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,340
So in this structure, what we're doing is

184
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,140
we're imagining that the short rate, y,

185
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,930
which is an observable, is nevertheless

186
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,080
described by an Ito process, and the value

187
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,080
of bonds of all maturities depend on that variable.

188
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,580
It might depend on other things too.

189
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,700
But let's start with the one-factor picture.

190
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,930
And let's see where that leads us.

191
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,000
