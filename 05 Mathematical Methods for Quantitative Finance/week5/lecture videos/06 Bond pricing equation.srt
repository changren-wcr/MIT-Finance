1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,460
PROFESSOR: So how can we generalize

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,310
the work we've done so far to this new setting?

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,040
How do we find a partial differential equation that

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,250
describes the prices of bonds?

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,890
Remember that in the case of stock options,

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,680
we had a definite underlying that was tradable,

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,600
and we built a portfolio of the stock with the derivative.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,670
But here we have a whole bunch of bonds,

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,490
they're all on an equal footing, and none of them

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,650
is actually the random variable of interest.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,310
So the thing that we know that's described by an Ito process

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,520
is the short rate, and the prices depend on that.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,530
So how can we generalize things?

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,720
How can we set up a relationship that could lead to a PDE?

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,140
What kind of instruments can we use for hedging?

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,760
Now what we'd like to do is first,

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,860
let's count our stochastic degrees of freedom.

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,580
We've got one.

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,050
We have a single short rate.

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,190
And of course, this generalizes for more sophisticated models,

21
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,110
but let's just start with that.

22
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,480
It's not tradable, but we have a whole bunch

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,540
of bonds, all of which depend on that rate.

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,450
Since there are multiple bonds, they all

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,940
have a dependence on that single factor,

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,670
if we put them together in a portfolio

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,950
and we think about dynamically rebalancing the portfolio,

28
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,820
it should be possible to cancel out the risk

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,990
and determine a PDE that gives us the relative relationship

30
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,220
among bonds.

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,330
How many bonds?

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,100
Why don't we start with two?

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,280
That would let us cancel the common source of risk

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,510
to both of them.

35
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,740
Which two?

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,150
Take your pick.

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,892
So let's see what we can do.

38
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:39,850
We're going to start with the one-factor model,

39
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,642
and we're going to assume that all the bond

40
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:44,130
prices depend on this single stochastic variable,

41
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,190
the short rate.

42
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,450
So what we'll do is we'll take two zero-coupon bonds

43
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,590
of different maturities.

44
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,840
We'll think of them as being T1 and T2 and the values

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,690
as being the V1 and V2.

46
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,960
And we'll create a dynamic portfolio

47
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,150
that's going to be risk-free.

48
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,380
Where do we start?

49
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,730
With Ito's lemma.

50
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,300
So for each bond, Ito's formula tells us

51
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,979
that the DV, the differential for the value of the bond,

52
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,320
is given by partial of V with respect

53
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,010
to t times dt plus partial of V with respect

54
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,860
to y dy plus the Ito term, which here I've

55
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,590
grouped with the coefficient of dt that's

56
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,370
given by the usual form, b squared over 2 second partial

57
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,170
of V with respect to y.

58
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,560
So keep in mind now that this is analogous to what

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,430
we saw for stocks where s is replaced by y,

60
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,030
and the b squared is going to depend on the particular model

61
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,640
that we have for the short interest rate.

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,090
But our portfolio doesn't consist of any y's ,

63
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,210
it's only going to consist of v's.

64
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,210
Let's see how that goes.

65
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,860


66
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,710
So we're going to do is let's build

67
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:59,730
a portfolio with q1 bonds of value 1 and q2 bonds value 2,

68
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,710
and we'll call this value oi, and we'd

69
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,480
like to eliminate risk.

70
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,270
Well, we can do that in exactly the same way

71
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,380
that we did before, by choosing an appropriate ratio of q1

72
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,190
and q2.

73
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,630
Now keep in mind, when we looked at the stock option case,

74
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,805
we thought of keeping a single option in a variable number

75
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,180
of shares of stock, but there was

76
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,000
no reason we had to do that except partly,

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,430
historical interest, and partly, the realities of trading

78
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,320
in the market, which is that stock is

79
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,760
much more liquid than options.

80
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,770
But we could have held one share of stock

81
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,830
in our hedging argument.

82
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,770
It would've gone through exactly the same way

83
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,500
if we'd varied the number of options that we had.

84
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,490
And in fact, the overall scale doesn't matter.

85
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,060
What matters is the ratio of the number

86
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,250
of shares of one instrument relative to another.

87
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,530
So the same thing holds here.

88
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,830
But this time it's actually a little bit clearer,

89
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,870
because v1 and v2 are on equal footing.

90
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,710
So if I build a portfolio with q1 units of bond 1,

91
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,310
q2 units of bond 2 that have maturities t1 and t2,

92
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,480
and I choose these ratios in this particular way--

93
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,040
that are given by the ratios that

94
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,570
look like what we previously called the delta in the case

95
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,940
of the stock option--

96
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,560
then, and if I apply Ito's formula to this portfolio,

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,320
I can cancel the risky terms.

98
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,130
I can cancel the coefficients of dy

99
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,880
and be left only with something in dt, the same way

100
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,970
that we eliminated risk in deriving the Black-Scholes

101
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,940
equation.

102
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,310
So what do we get?

103
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,290
By combining the portfolio in this way

104
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,820
with the specially chosen ratio of q1 to q2,

105
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,420
we can see that our portfolio pi earns the risk-free rate.

106
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,550
So instead of r times pi dt, now because it's

107
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,160
earning over an infinitesimal period of time

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,310
and y is the short-term interest rate,

109
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,440
I have the d pi, because it's risk-free,

110
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,180
is going to earn y dt times the value of that portfolio, pi.

111
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,170
So it's earning a risk-free rate at rate y.

112
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,940
If I expand the differentials and I

113
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,440
take account of the cancellation from q1 and q2,

114
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,530
the terms that don't cancel give me this expression.

115
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:19,100
I've got a sum over 1 and 2 for q sub i of dV dt

116
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,040
plus b squared over 2 second partial of V

117
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,950
with respect to y squared, all times dt.

118
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,740
So this left-hand side is all something

119
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,540
that's proportional to dt.

120
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,310
It's got a bunch of partial derivatives,

121
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,550
a bunch of quantities in front, and it's something

122
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,900
that's deterministic.

123
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,540
On the right-hand side, I also have something proportional

124
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,650
to dt.

125
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,200
It's y times the value of the portfolio itself.

126
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,680
So notice now the structure that we've got.

127
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,190
The last time we did this for deriving Black-Scholes,

128
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,810
we had a whole bunch of terms that

129
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,730
were all coefficients of dt.

130
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,130
We said the only way that that could hold

131
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,940
is if the coefficients of dt were themselves equal.

132
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,830
So that is, this summation here should

133
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,150
be equal to y times q1 v1 plus q2 v2.

134
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,680
Now notice that we've got a bunch of 1s and a bunch of 2s,

135
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,340
and they're separate.

136
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,420
So we have a bunch of terms that sum with q1 and v1,

137
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,000
and a bunch of other terms with q2 and v2.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,560
And one of the standard techniques

139
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,830
for solving and organizing differential equations

140
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,730
is to separate variables.

141
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,610
So let's choose, not just the ratio of q1 over q2,

142
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,620
let's set the scale, let's pick a particular value.

143
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,620
So here's a convenient one.

144
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,790
If we take q1 to be 1 over--

145
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,160


146
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,920
let's see if I can get my pointer back.

147
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,770


148
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,600
If I can take q1 to be 1 over partial of V with respect to y,

149
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,970
assuming that's non-zero, and q2 to be

150
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,780
minus the similar kind of thing, you

151
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,380
notice these two choices will satisfy this ratio.

152
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,370
That's all I need.

153
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,860
And when I go back to my expression for Ito,

154
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,420
you see that that will be sufficient

155
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,250
when I multiply q1 times this term with v1 and q2

156
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,910
with that term to v2, that will cancel out the dy terms.

157
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,180
So this particular choice not only

158
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,680
cancels out the dy terms that's already given by this ratio,

159
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,470
but it lets us separate the v1 and the v2 terms completely.

160
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,700
So here's what we get.

161
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,070
Let's equate the coefficients of dt.

162
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,750
Let's group the terms together.

163
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,970
Let's put all the v1's on the left,

164
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,590
let's put all the v2's on the right.

165
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,970
And because that minus sign in front of q2,

166
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,070
we have the following nice symmetrical expression.

167
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:56,150
We have one equation in terms of two unknown prices, v1 and v2.

168
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,420
So I have this expression in v1 is equal to this expression

169
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,010
here in v2.

170
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,960
And let's look at the structure for a moment.

171
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,620
In the numerator, we see that most of these terms, these

172
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,110
are three of the four terms that showed up

173
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,010
in the Black-Scholes equation, partial of V with respect to t.

174
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,250
I've got a b squared over 2 second partial with respect

175
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,010
to y minus v1.

176
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,060
And then I've divided by partial of v1 with respect to y1.

177
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,180
That's my q.

178
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,220
And over here, I've got the same thing,

179
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,850
but just with all the subscripts 1 replaced by subscripts 2.

180
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,799
So it's different from Black-Scholes.

181
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,549
Before, I had an expression for a single variable v,

182
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,710
and I set it equal to 0.

183
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,630
In this case, I have two expressions, one of them in v1,

184
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,890
one of them in v2, and I set them equal to each other.

185
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,860
Neither of them is equal to 0.

186
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,320
So it doesn't look like we made a lot of progress.

187
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,010
Again, one equation for two unknowns, v1 and v2.

188
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,560
But let's think about the structure for a moment.

189
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,130
Because all the v1's and v2's are isolated--

190
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,960
and remember that the v1's and v2's

191
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,730
correspond to the prices of bonds of different maturities--

192
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,350
that really tells us something.

193
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,030
Because the expression on the left depends on T1,

194
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,360
the second expression depends on T2.

195
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,710
But these two expressions are equal to each other.

196
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,025
And the one on the left doesn't have any T2's, the one

197
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:25,450
on the right doesn't have T1's.

198
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,800
How could that be?

199
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
The only way that this expression can hold,

200
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,450
that we can have these two things

201
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,800
equal to each other, that this can be equal to this,

202
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,250
is if neither of them depends on T1 or T2.

203
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,420
That is, this entire ratio as well as this one

204
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,650
need to be constant.

205
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,220
They need to be independent of the particular bond.

206
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,080
They can't depend on the bond's maturity.

207
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,480
They can't depend on anything else for the bond.

208
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,730
They need to be something that depends only

209
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,100
on time and on the short rate, which

210
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,180
are the two things that they have in common.

211
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,980
Anything that's bonds specific can't appear.

212
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,040
So it's in the individual terms, the v1

213
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,140
and its partial derivatives are there,

214
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,170
but that particular grouping of partial derivatives

215
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,570
and all those different terms in the numerators

216
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,960
need to be such that all of the explicit things that

217
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,270
are bond-dependent cancel out.

218
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:26,370
So because each side needs to be independent

219
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,120
and they're both equal to each other,

220
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,750
we can give that thing that they're equal to a name.

221
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,390
And we'll call it f.

222
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,910
We'll call it f, and we'll say it can depend on t,

223
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,350
and it can depend on y.

224
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,030
So it's some unknown function.

225
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,330
It's not 0, but it is something that doesn't

226
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,170
depend on the individual bonds.

227
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,190
And in fact, this is not only true for bond 1 and bond 2,

228
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,150
which are arbitrary.

229
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,880
It has to be true for all of the bonds,

230
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
no matter what their maturities are.

231
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,970
So here's what we found.

232
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,200
Now we have a differential equation for the bond pricing.

233
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,400
We've got the equation for any bond with any subscript i,

234
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,580
we have this Black-Scholes-like equation,

235
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,540
partial of V with respect to t plus second derivative,

236
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,970
this our diffusion term, with b squared over 2--

237
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,690
b comes from the Ito process defining y--

238
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,490
minus yV.

239
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,080
Remember, this looks like our minus rV term in Black-Scholes.

240
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,910
But now instead of r, it's replaced

241
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,870
by y, which is dynamic.

242
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,630
It's not the constant risk-free rate.

243
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,330
It's the dynamical random variable.

244
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,490
And then I have this other term, f of y--

245
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,900
which is a function that we don't know, it's unspecified--

246
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,143
times the partial of V with respect to y,

247
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:41,310
that we get just by multiplying through and clearing

248
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,270
denominators.

249
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,130
And that whole thing is equal to 0.

250
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,260
And what do we have for a boundary condition?

251
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,480
These are zero coupon bonds that are typically

252
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,210
normalized by saying that at maturity, they

253
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,440
pay off $1 or one unit.

254
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,590
We can pick a different normalization if we'd like.

255
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,440
So they have the normalization, then at maturity,

256
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,640
they're equal to 1.

257
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,520
But at times prior, their value's

258
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,620
determined by this differential equation,

259
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,310
and the maturity is one of the defining features

260
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,880
of the particular bond.
