1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,020
PROFESSOR: Now we're almost ready to do Black-Scholes.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,310
Let's consider our portfolio.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,160
But now we're going to augment pi by including cash.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,870
So before I wrote down that pi was V minus delta S.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,680
And that was partly to lure you toward the answer.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,500
Let's be much more open minded about what the number of shares

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,435
is, and just leave it as a generic q,

8
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:28,420
and yet put in a plus sign here for Q.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,100
So we're going to have to solve for everything.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,070
So my general rule for the portfolio

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,150
is, I have the value of 1 option plus the number of shares

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,240
times the value per share plus the amount of cash

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,610
times the value of the cash, and that's

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,320
the value of a portfolio.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,600
So what happens to this portfolio as we rebalance?

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,060
Well, we think of our picture.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,980
And we've got the rebalancing.

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,560
And we have the dynamics between two different periods.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,140
So the rebalancing, we know that the value doesn't

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,580
change by accounting rules.

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,500
We're just changing one asset for another.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,790
So what happens between two rebalancings,

23
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,420
that is, over the time scale of one market day?

24
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,450
Well, we're holding-- remember our picture,

25
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,170
over the market day, we're holding our quantities fixed,

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,070
and the prices are changing.

27
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,400
So the change in value in the portfolio

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,560
is a change in value of the option

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,560
plus this quantity is held fixed, the stock changes value,

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,520
the cash balance is held fixed, and possibly

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,490
the money changes value where we're earning interest.

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,180
If we go to the continuous time limit, and go to differentials,

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,380
we see that we can write that as d pi, as dV

34
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,090
plus d of qS plus CM.

35
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,020
That is, I'm just taking the differential of my top line.

36
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,850
Now, let's expand it out.

37
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,680
This is dV plus--

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,470
and let's keep everything from our product rule.

39
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,950
I have qdS plus Sdq, which I've put out here.

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,479
I have C plus dqdS.

41
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,220
I have CdM plus MdC plus dCdM.

42
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,090
And I've grouped these this way for a reason.

43
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,010
These four terms are just a self-financing condition

44
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,210
that we saw previously.

45
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,260
So these four terms together are all

46
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,300
present on the right-hand side, but collectively they equal 0.

47
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,210
So our expression gets a lot simpler.

48
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,430
d pi is dV plus qdS plus CdM.

49
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,920
Now we recognize that dM, the change in the value of money,

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,680
is just our rMdt.

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,630
That's the risk-free rate.

52
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,162
Finally, we can take CM--

53
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:55,830
which, we don't really want to see money

54
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,570
in our equation anyways.

55
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,140
Come back up here, and we can replace CM

56
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:08,640
by pi minus V minus qS, which I've done right here.

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,540
So now I have an expression for d pi.

58
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:20,210
dV plus qdS plus r times this quantity times dt.

59
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,960
Now we want to look for a dynamic trading strategy

60
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,110
where the number of shares that we have, q, not only

61
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,180
is we're not going to assume it's constant.

62
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,010
We expect it to be changing.

63
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,800
In fact, that's going to give us to rule for how

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,430
we can execute these hedges.

65
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,150
That's going to give us the rule for how we can actually

66
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,230
eliminate risk.

67
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,050
So the reason we can do this, and we

68
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,880
would expect this to work, is there's

69
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,460
only one stochastic driver in the entire problem,

70
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,930
and that's the stock.

71
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,820
So we have that dS term.

72
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,610
And we know that the stock moves,

73
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,660
but the value of the derivative is random, the value of V

74
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,090
random through its dependence on S. So we've got one driver.

75
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,360
We have two, possibly three instruments.

76
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,730
Maybe we can cancel it out in a dynamic way.

77
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,880
So let's take a look.

78
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,100
I'm going to take my previous expression.

79
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,649
And all I'm going to do is, in place of dV,

80
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,390
I'm going to use Ito's lemma.

81
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,860
So I'm going to have this set of terms, dt plus partial of V

82
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,530
with respect to S times dS.

83
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,270
And this term over here comes along

84
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,560
from the ride from the previous slide.

85
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,890
Notice that, if I group my dS terms together--

86
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,970
OK, I have this is a dt term, this is a dt term,

87
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,020
I've got my dS terms here.

88
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,680
Can I make this coefficient go away?

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,270
Yes, we can.

90
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,610
If we define q to be minus partial of V with respect to S.

91
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,150
And that corresponds to what we called minus delta before.

92
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,910
But now, notice that we're not assuming

93
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,510
that anything is constant.

94
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:04,700
In fact, we're requiring that we trade such that q always

95
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,640
is equal to partial of V with respect to S

96
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,770
so that the risk is always balanced.

97
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,420
We can do that instantaneously.

98
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,750
When the prices change, we might need to retrade.

99
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,190
So this dynamic rehedging lets us eliminate risk

100
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,770
at the cost of possibly doing a lot of trading

101
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,600
over very small intervals.

102
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,370


103
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,120
Finally, with this choice, we can go through and simplify.

104
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,760
And we'll find that we get the same Black-Scholes.

105
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,230
Equation again.

106
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,390
This term here goes away.

107
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,310
Everything else we group together, has a dt in it.

108
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,370
We look for the coefficient of dt and set

109
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,450
that equal to 0 because we've said d pi is not changing.

110
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,240
And we finally have-- because remember

111
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,670
d pi is not changing now because pi includes the cash.

112
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,800
And the interest is all incorporated

113
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,560
as part of our portfolio.

114
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,750
So we started with a portfolio with initial value 0.

115
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,980
It's self-financing.

116
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,690
There's no money coming in or out.

117
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,020
There's no risk.

118
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,870
So it began with value 0.

119
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,460
It stays 0.

120
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,320
The rate of change is 0.

121
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,890
And that tells us that this big expression in parentheses

122
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:21,360
has to be 0 for all time and for all values of S

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,590
where the option is alive.

124
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,230
That's prior to expiration.

125
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,600
And that gives us the Black-Scholes.

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,210
Partial differential equation once again,

127
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,060
this time without cheating.

128
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,880
So the lesson to take away from this, apart

129
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,970
from two different derivations for getting Black-Scholes.

130
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,450
Equation is this notion of, number one,

131
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,170
that we have a self-financing portfolio, that this

132
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,800
is a self-contained closed world where we're able to rebalance.

133
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,370
And because we have these multiple instruments and only

134
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,180
one source of risk, we're able to cancel out the risk.

135
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,550
By looking at the rebalancing, though,

136
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,710
even though we're back continuous time,

137
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,200
by having broken it into two parts--

138
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,760
the rebalancing where we hold prices fixed and change

139
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,520
quantities and the evolution period

140
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,320
where we hold the quantities fixed

141
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,300
and the prices can change--

142
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,630
that becomes hard to distinguish if we do everything

143
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,610
immediately in continuous time.

144
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,480
But it is important that we do things in a nonparticipating

145
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,110
way.

146
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,340
So these are discrete.

147
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,250
That is, we need to observe, and then trade, observe,

148
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,250
and then trade, no matter how small the time intervals.

149
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,200
We can't do it in the opposite order.

150
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,800
If we could see the future prices and then trade on them,

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,790
that would be a terrific source of riches.

152
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,170
Unfortunately, real markets don't work that way.

153
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,060
And our mathematics needs to respect that.
