1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,790
PROFESSOR: Now, the Black-Scholes equation

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,930
that we just derived is one of the most important equations

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,200
in modern finance, and the derivation only took us

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,210
two slides.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,850
But I pulled a fast one.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,680
Can you tell where?

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,290
The derivation, remember, assumed

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,960
that the number of shares was constant, right?

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,170
But then we found that the number of shares that we needed

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,990
for delta in order to do our hedge

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,630
was partial to V with respect to S.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,540
But when we solve the equation, we

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,780
find out that V depends on S and on time,

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,810
and therefore, delta is going to depend on S and time.

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,700
And therefore, delta actually isn't constant at all.

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,460
So this contradicts something that

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,325
was an essential assumption of our derivation.

18
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:55,450
Now, we're going to do a little bit of a digression

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,000
here, and let me give you the short version

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,780
so that you know our result is OK.

21
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,460
The derivation was a little shaky.

22
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,340
So we're going to go through it more carefully,

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,460
and we'll be much more solid ground,

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,270
but the end result is the same.

25
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,150
So the derivation I showed you was very quick,

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,450
it was very slick, but it a cheat.

27
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,680
It was wrong.

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,980
The intuition was right, and you can apply similar intuition

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,150
in other cases.

30
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,640
But there's some deeper mechanisms going on

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,540
that we should take a look at, and actually, it's

32
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,770
pretty nice too.

33
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,150
So what was the problem?

34
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,200
The problem was that when we had a differential that we should

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,810
have taken, the differential of delta S,

36
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,760
we just said, oh, that's delta dS.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,000
That is, we treated the delta as being constant.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,820
What we should have said is, hm, maybe we

39
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:52,010
need a generalized chain rule to apply to cases where

40
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,570
we have a product rule, where we have

41
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,810
a product of two processes or two random variables.

42
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,350
So at a minimum, we should have been cautious

43
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,460
and at least written the differential of delta S

44
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,690
is delta dS plus Sd delta plus maybe a higher order

45
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,113
term, d delta dS.

46
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,530
And then we'd have to figure out what each of those things

47
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,030
means.

48
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,960


49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,510
So to do this right, we're going to bring in one

50
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,010
extra financial instrument.

51
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,530
We started with an underlying, the stock,

52
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,140
and we had options, or our general derivative V,

53
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,630
and now we're going to include cash

54
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,060
because if you think about it, I said things are growing

55
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,370
at the risk-free rate, and we're dynamically

56
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,400
rebalancing our portfolio, but we're doing it with what money?

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,790
We need some cash to be able to buy and sell shares

58
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,010
to execute our delta hedge.

59
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,640
So our dynamic trading strategy that we're going to look at

60
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,970
is as follows.

61
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,570
We're going to buy and hold our derivative.

62
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,810
We're going to rebalance our stock position,

63
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,000
but it's going to be self-financing,

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,805
so we're going to start out with no money, but a lot of credit.

65
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:03,930
We're going to assume that we could lend and borrow

66
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,900
at the risk-free rate, an arbitrary amount,

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,420
and that the stock purchases and sales are funded directly

68
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,570
from that account.

69
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,730
So if I'm going to short sell shares worth $10,000,

70
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,760
I take in $10,000 to the cash account,

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,030
and I've sold short the shares.

72
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,860
If I need to buy long $20,000 worth of stock, I buy it,

73
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,410
and my account balance in the cash account

74
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,330
goes down by $20,000.

75
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,690
And if I'm earning interest at the risk-free rate,

76
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,970
that accrues to the cash account.

77
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,900
And if I'm borrowing money, if the balance in my cash account

78
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,270
is negative, then I need to pay interest.

79
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,970
But interest, either way, regardless of the sign,

80
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,160
it's always going to be the risk-free rate times

81
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,087
dt times the quantity in the cash account.

82
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:54,670
Now, I've made a bunch of assumptions,

83
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,540
so let's be explicit about what they are.

84
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,190
These are all idealizations for the real world.

85
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,710
First, I assume I have unlimited credit,

86
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,020
so I can lend or borrow as much as I want.

87
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,810
I'm assuming that I lend and borrow at the same rate,

88
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,040
at the risk-free rate.

89
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,730
In reality, it costs a little more to borrow,

90
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,280
and you earn a little bit less when you lend.

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,470
I'm assuming that the stock can be traded

92
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,110
in fractional quantities, so I'm not

93
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,050
going to restrict delta to be an integer.

94
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:27,030
On the other hand, so is that a bad assumption?

95
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,790
Sure, because we can't really trade fractional shares easily,

96
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,510
but in an institutional setting, we're

97
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,730
not buying a single option.

98
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,340
In fact, a single option contract in the United States

99
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,850
is on 100 shares of stock, and we might buy many contracts.

100
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,268
So we can be concerned about rounding errors,

101
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:46,560
but generally, this won't be an issue because we're not

102
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,570
doing this for a single option.

103
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,130
We're assuming that we have full use

104
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,290
of the proceeds of short sales, something

105
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,950
that is actually limited because we have to keep collateral.

106
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,410
We're assuming that there are no dividends for this,

107
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,470
no transaction costs, no delays, no market impact.

108
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,220
So a whole bunch of frictionless trading assumptions, just

109
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,300
for purposes of our derivation.
