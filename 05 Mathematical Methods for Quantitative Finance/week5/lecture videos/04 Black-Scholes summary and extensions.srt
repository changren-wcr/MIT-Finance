1
00:00:01,143 --> 00:00:03,060
PROFESSOR: Let's summarize a few key formulas.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,720
Ito processes are our generalized random walks,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,540
our generalized processes that have the form a dt plus b dB

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,280
where little a and little b are, in general, functions

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,675
of x and t.

6
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:23,770
x, in our example of stock prices, is s- is price--

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,890
but it may take different values.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,340
Ito's formula tells us, for stochastic processes of the Ito

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,520
type, Ito's formula from Ito's lemma

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,070
tells us how to compute differentials.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,820
And they have an extra term relative to the ordinary chain

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,690
rule.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,420
We have first partial with respect to t,

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,390
first partial with respect to x, and then we

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,170
have a second partial with respect to x but times

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,020
dt instead of dx squared.

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,360
We remember the heuristic-- that every time we see

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,700
a d b squared, it's worth a dt.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,130
Every time we would have seen a dx squared,

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,050
it's worth a b squared dt, where little b is the same

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,060
as the coefficient up here.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,690
Our most common and most popular Ito process

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,950
is the standard stock price formula

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,810
that's written as dS over S is mu dt plus sigma db,

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,200
or multiply thing through by S so that we can correctly

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,480
identify the coefficients a and b,

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,910
we can write this is dS is mu S dt plus sigma S db.

28
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,730
We saw-- and you should check and be familiar with this--

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,660
that if we apply Ito's lemma to the function f equals log S,

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,910
we derive, on the right-hand side,

31
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,400
that the differential of log S-- this

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,890
is an exact differential on the left-hand side,

33
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,890
and on the right-hand side is an Ito process

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,780
with constant coefficients.

35
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,930
The sigma parameter now doesn't have an S in here,

36
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,930
and the mu is shifted by an amount

37
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,270
minus sigma squared over 2.

38
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,490
To derive the Black-Scholes equation,

39
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,090
we combine this stock price evolution

40
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,370
with a hedging algorithm where we

41
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,070
pick a number of shares delta that's

42
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,640
always equal to partial of V with respect to S

43
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,990
to hold short.

44
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,290
We assume that our portfolio grows at the risk-free rate.

45
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,040
And we're able to eliminate risk by dynamically hedging.

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,000
And that tells us what the value of a derivative

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,090
must be in order to avoid arbitrage.

48
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,450
It's given by solutions to this equation.

49
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,190
What I want to do is just show a couple

50
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,675
of tweaks that we can make to the equation.

51
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:36,300
And then we're going to turn to looking

52
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,717
at how to solve the equation.

53
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:39,300
The way we're going to do it is, we're

54
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,650
going to simplify the equation.

55
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,118
This is pretty complicated to solve, and along the way,

56
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:46,410
we're going to turn it into a much simpler differential

57
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,392
equation.

58
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:49,350
We'll take a look at that equation for a while.

59
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,180
It's called the diffusion equation.

60
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,050
And then we'll recover it back in our original Black-Scholes

61
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,370
variables.

62
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,210
First, some of the overall properties.

63
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,710
The equation is linear.

64
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,900
And that means that the sum of two solutions,

65
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,030
or any linear combination of solutions,

66
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,200
is always a solution.

67
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,150
Now, in boundary value in partial differential equations,

68
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,010
we sometimes look at initial values.

69
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,770
We sometimes look at boundary values on the sides.

70
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,552
But what's special about our application for finance--

71
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:21,510
it's a little bit different from what you would

72
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,640
see in a typical PDE textbook.

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,560
Is, instead of initial conditions,

74
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,870
we're going to specify a terminal condition.

75
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,340
That is, when we think about options,

76
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,310
we know what they're worth when they expire.

77
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,010
We want to know what they're worth before expiration.

78
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,610
The payoff is contractually determined at a future date,

79
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,220
and we're going to have to work backwards in time.

80
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,040
Luckily, we'll see that the signs in our equation

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,868
work out just right for that.

82
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:47,910
Now, there are a whole bunch of other assumptions

83
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,660
that go into this.

84
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,960
In particular, we're looking at a special stock price model--

85
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,840
namely, geometric Brownian motion.

86
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,270
But a lot of what we said could go through

87
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,120
for other kinds of processes.

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,810
We can change the process to some of the examples

89
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,280
I showed you earlier.

90
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,160
And we might ask about generalizing further

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,680
where some of the things that we've held constant

92
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,800
perhaps become, themselves, dynamic over time.

93
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,750
What happens if volatility changes

94
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,800
over time, which seems to be a real-world phenomenon

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,140
in financial markets?

96
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,350
What if there are limits on the allowed prices?

97
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,960
There are lots of generalizations we could make.

98
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,160
Let's take a look at a few easy ones.

99
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,170
One of them is that I neglected dividends.

100
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,780
And if you've studied options before,

101
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,340
you know that discrete dividends are a big deal.

102
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,700
There's a theorem about early exercise.

103
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,027
Now, the dividends I'm going to discuss here

104
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:43,110
are not discrete dividends, which we usually would

105
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,360
handle with different tools.

106
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,570
But I want to think about a continuous dividend

107
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,610
yield, which is one way that we typically

108
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,750
model indices or portfolios.

109
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,155
We think that if there are a bunch of stocks that

110
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:58,530
get dividends at different times,

111
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,170
we'll just kind of average this out smoothly.

112
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,800
The important thing is that, if dividends arrive at a rate D,

113
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,350
we might think that the dividends are

114
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,080
kind of offsetting the interest rate.

115
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,750
But there are two reasons--

116
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,630
there are two places where the interest rate enters

117
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,380
the equation, and only one place where the dividends show up.

118
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,260
So it's not just a shift in the risk-free rate.

119
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,590
The holder of the stock gets dividends,

120
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,670
but the holder of the option does not get the dividends.

121
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:34,110
That's the whole thing behind the timing of early exercise.

122
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,300
The Black-Scholes equation is modified,

123
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,030
but it's not just a straight substitution of r.

124
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,490
It's a substitution in this term,

125
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:50,960
because the stock is earning dividends.

126
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,780


127
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,570
We could think of currency options,

128
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,380
which are on foreign currency.

129
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,290
And we don't just trade suitcases full of cash.

130
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,400
We trade interest-bearing instruments.

131
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,820
On currency options, we receive a foreign interest rate, which

132
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,980
is equivalent to a cash inflow.

133
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,620
Again, we've got to change to our cash.

134
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,590
And again, it's not just a straight-out substitution

135
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,090
of the interest rates.

136
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,150
Here, we've got to change to r in this place.

137
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,500
This r stays the same.

138
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,730
We have another adjustment we can make in commodity options,

139
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,460
where we have a cost of carry.

140
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,470
It doesn't cost anything to store a stock option.

141
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,250
It does cost something if you have oil

142
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,740
and you have options on oil.

143
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,100
Having an oil option doesn't cost anything, but having oil

144
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,150
does cost something.

145
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,140
Having gold does cost something-- to store it,

146
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,400
to have security for it, possibly to transport it.

147
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,450
So when we look at physical commodities,

148
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,440
we typically include a cost of carry for the duration

149
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,570
of the contract at a rate q.

150
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,860
And guess what?

151
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,460
That shows up in this term.

152
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,120
And once again, the other interest rate term

153
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,170
is unchanged.

154
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,960


155
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,395
Options on futures are an interesting case,

156
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,250
and we can get an equation called

157
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,510
the Black equation, which Fischer Black did on his own,

158
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,770
without Scholes.

159
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,860
And we do this by changing the value

160
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,820
from the spot to the forward price.

161
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,490
Keep in mind that there is discounting.

162
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,933
We can think about present values.

163
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,850
And in fact, we'll see that one reason there's

164
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,700
a lot of complexity in the Black-Scholes equation

165
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,590
is because we didn't build discounting

166
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,330
into it to begin with.

167
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,040
You can see that the equation simplifies

168
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,770
a lot if we were to set the interest rate equal to 0.

169
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,290
But there are two things we might potentially discount.

170
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,620
One of them is S. The other one is V.

171
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,560
Let's take a look.

172
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,590
If we change variables so that we

173
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,290
do things in terms of the forward price instead

174
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,575
of the spot price, I can introduce this script F,

175
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:00,950
which I've done because we used F

176
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,690
before for a general function.

177
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,580
Here, I'd like this F to represent

178
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,220
the forward price that's related to the spot

179
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,370
price in the usual way.

180
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,130
And we substitute in-- use the ordinary chain

181
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,610
rule, because there's nothing special about this pre-factor.

182
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,110
F and s are both stochastic, but e to the r t minus t is not.

183
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,660
And we get a simpler equation.

184
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,270
One of our terms from our original Black-Scholes equation

185
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,470
dropped out.

186
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,470
And that's telling us, what that equation really was doing

187
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,200
was accounting for the fact that we

188
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,480
should think about the present value rather than the spot

189
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,710
value.

190
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,080
In those terms, my Black-Scholes equation now

191
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,600
has only a term with a time derivative,

192
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,440
and with a second derivative with respect to the under line,

193
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,630
the first derivative term went away.

194
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,533
And I still have the constant term that's left over.

195
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,950
Now, what I would like to do is, I

196
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,980
would like to compare this with another well-known equation

197
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,590
called the diffusion equation, which I've written

198
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,410
down here at the bottom.

199
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,470
The diffusion equation-- you'll notice both of these equations

200
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,520
have a term partial of V with respect to t.

201
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,070
The next term-- they both have a 1/2.

202
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,010
They both have a second derivative with respect

203
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,810
to another variable over here.

204
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,120
This has a pre-factor.

205
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,980
This one doesn't.

206
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,930
This has a plus sign.

207
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,760
This one has a minus sign.

208
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,960
And of course, there's this extra leftover term right here.

209
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,600
But the first two terms are intriguing.

210
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,640
And we're going to go a bit further and see

211
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,350
if we can get the original Black-Scholes

212
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,480
equation to be related to a diffusion equation.

213
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,000
