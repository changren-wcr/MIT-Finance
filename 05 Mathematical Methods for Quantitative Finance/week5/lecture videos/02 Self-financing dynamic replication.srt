1
00:00:00,977 --> 00:00:03,060
PROFESSOR: Now, I'd like you to give you a picture

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,390
and have you keep this picture in mind, because it's

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,160
a discrete picture, and then we're

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,050
going to let delta t go to 0 again.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,760
But in many ways, a discrete picture

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,950
is important and gives us some insight

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,870
into what's going on in the Black-Scholes world.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,890
So what I'd like to do is think of each of these segments

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,012
as being related to a given trading period.

10
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:23,970
And we'll think of this as being a trading day.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,020
And in fact, this is how many option traders and market

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,160
makers do trade.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,009
They think of re-hedging, let's say, once per period

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,835
or that might be once per day.

15
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:35,460
So what I want to do is I want to think

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,680
about opening an initial position here at the beginning.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,020
And then there's intraday period and then the end of the day

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,470
comes and we observe the closing prices at the end of the day.

19
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,730
I'm going to assume that very close to the end,

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,990
let's say a minute 30 seconds before the equity markets

21
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,080
close, that there's a lot of activity and liquidity

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,990
in the markets and that without waiting for the shares

23
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,030
to close, they're not going to move very much

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,580
but that I can buy or sell shares

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,150
to set a new delta position to have for the following day.

26
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,700
So here's what I assume.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,830
At the end of each day, I'm going

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,170
to observe the price of the underlying,

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,070
but I'm also going to use that information to construct

30
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,750
a new hedge position.

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,160
And then I'll wait for the next trading day

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,860
and at the end of that day, I'll repeat the process.

33
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,390
So I've broken this set of steps into two parts.

34
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,110
One of them is that when the market is open,

35
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,900
the quantities that we have are held fixed,

36
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,840
but the prices change as the market moves.

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,360
So prices change, but we're not doing any trading

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,300
during the day.

39
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,937
At the end of the day, the prices no longer move.

40
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:50,270
I'm assuming they move very, very little during the time

41
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,530
it takes us to do this.

42
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,750
At the end of the day, as I rebalance,

43
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,380
the prices are held fixed, but the quantities change.

44
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,700
So from an accounting perspective,

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,700
the rebalancing is just exchanging

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,170
one asset for another.

47
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,290
We're exchanging cash for stock of equal value.

48
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:07,890
OK.

49
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,590
So we've got two things.

50
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,080
We've got the end of day rebalancing and fixed price

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,580
and we have the intraday market evolution dynamic stock price

52
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,440
evolution, dynamic option price evolution while we're holding

53
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,970
the quantities constant.

54
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,960
And when we look at the real world prices,

55
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,550
we see this is an example, a screenshot taken from Bloomberg

56
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,740
where we can see the price in Spotify

57
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,020
over several intraday periods.

58
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,980
You can see that on some days, the movements are jagged

59
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,270
and look stochastic.

60
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,670
And I've left out the overnight period.

61
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,440
And the next day begins more or less

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,890
where the other one started.

63
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,430
But that's not always the case.

64
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,580
Sometimes we do observe jumps and there are very big changes

65
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,370
from the close on one day to the beginning of the next day.

66
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,560
And we're either going to be excluding that

67
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,810
or it won't really matter because we're

68
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,590
going to be jumping from one end of day close

69
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,210
to the next end of day close.

70
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,730
So whether this dropped immediately on the open

71
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,690
or at some point during the day, the main driver for our results

72
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,180
is going to be where it ends up on the following day.

73
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,650


74
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,150
So

75
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,430
Let's leave the derivatives out of it for a moment

76
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,220
and look at a rebalancing condition

77
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,380
for this self-financing portfolio.

78
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,390
So let's let x be a portfolio that initially has value 0.

79
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,220
But again, I've got a lot of credit.

80
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,140
So it can have stocks and bonds.

81
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,770
And I'm going to just call our interest bearing instruments

82
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,550
cash.

83
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,500
Instead of money market, instead of a bond,

84
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,220
I'll refer to it as cash.

85
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,230
So let's assume that I have a portfolio x.

86
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,360
X is the value of the portfolio.

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,990
And I can have stock in quantity q

88
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:59,630
and I can have cash in quantity C. S is the value of the stock.

89
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,490
M is the value of money, which will

90
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,390
grow with the risk free rate.

91
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,290
So when I initially set up my portfolio,

92
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,800
I started with no money.

93
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,610
I'm going to end up with no money.

94
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,970
So my initial setup doesn't require any money.

95
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,500
And subsequent rebalancing never changes the portfolio value.

96
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,240
That is, if I want to be long stock at a positive price,

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,610
I'm going to need to have a negative cash

98
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,620
balance to finance it.

99
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,110
If I'm going to be short stock and this is negative,

100
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,700
I'll have positive cash.

101
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,160
And the amount of cash is determined

102
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,140
as C is going to equal minus qS over M, the value of money.

103
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,990
So it's as simple as that.

104
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,560
When we look at rebalancing at the end of a day, so

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
at the end of a day, the prices aren't changing.

106
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,450
And I look at the value from post re-hedging

107
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,630
compared to pre re-hedging where I changed

108
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,430
the quantities of stock.

109
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,310
What do I get?

110
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,970
Well, simple arithmetic.

111
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,650
So I've got S times the change in quantity

112
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,340
for the trade I do for re-hedging plus M times

113
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,350
the change in quantity in cash.

114
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,450
That's the change in value of the portfolio.

115
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,480
But because everything-- none of the prices are changing,

116
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,580
we're just shifting one asset into another.

117
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,830
That value is equal to 0.

118
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,653
Now, let me just rewrite that.

119
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:28,070
Because what I'd like to do is I'd

120
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,270
like to shift the end points a little bit.

121
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,200
So instead of ST and MT here, I'd

122
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,310
really like to have ST minus 1 and MT minus 1.

123
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,240
Because these represent a change in value

124
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,000
in the future from T minus 1 to T. And I'd like this to be--

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,490
I like to think of this as being a random variable,

126
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,710
and I want this to be non-anticipating.

127
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,410
So I'd like this to be at the beginning of my end point

128
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,240
rather than at the end of the end point over here.

129
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,040
So I can do that at the cost of adding two new terms just

130
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,630
to cancel the stuff I added.

131
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,280
And that gives me these terms down below.

132
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,720
And this is just arithmetic.

133
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,870
This is an exact equality.

134
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,920
Now if we think about turning this into infinitesimals

135
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,650
in continuous time and we recognize

136
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,460
that this whole thing is 0, we have the following equation

137
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,540
that represents self-financing.

138
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:32,240
Sdq, which is up here, plus MdC plus dSdq plus dMdC

139
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,890
now is equal to 0.

140
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:39,080
So this equation here holds when our rebalancing

141
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,320
is self-financing, when there's no new money coming in or going

142
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,870
out.
