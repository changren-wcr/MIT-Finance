00:00:01,816 --> 00:00:05,690
PROFESSOR: Is there a financial interpretation to the mystery

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,670
function f of t and y?

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,380
Well, here's one.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,230
We can think of it in terms of the risk premium on the bond.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,170
So the bond's Ito process can be written as usual.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,340
From Ito's Lemma is dV something times dt plus something

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,060
times dy.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,760
And let's put it in standard form.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,570
We will rewrite it as something times dt plus something times

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,740
dB.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,460
So the coefficient of dB is what we usually think of

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,930
is being the volatility.

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,240
And it's associated with the randomness.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,380
If that coefficient were to go to 0,

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,680
the equation would be deterministic.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,120
It would only depend.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,610
It would have time evolution determined by dt.

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,530
But there wouldn't be any randomness associated with it.

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,010
So we can think of the deterministic piece

20
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,420
as telling us about the growth rate in the absence of risk

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,270
and this piece being associated with the risk.

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,050
So if we ask about the amount of excess

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,410
risk there is and the amount of--

24
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,910
excuse me-- the amount of risk there

25
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,910
is relative to the amount of excess return

26
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,190
above the risk-free rate, we can take

27
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,690
the value, the return on the bond, dV in a given period,

28
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,770
relative to what it would earn if it were risk free.

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,760
So if it were risk free, this would be equal to 0.

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,500
And then we divide it by the risk

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,130
to get the ratio of excess return per unit of risk.

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,400
And we have this expression.

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,110
And the coefficient of dt, in this case, in terms of a and b,

34
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,150
the coefficients from the Ito process,

35
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,990
and f, our unknown function, that particular combination

36
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,710
a plus f over b is given a name.

37
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,230
And it's called the market price of risk.

38
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,540
Now, we give it a symbol.

39
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,560
We'll call it eta.

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,928
So we can track it through some further manipulations

41
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:57,470
if we'd like.

42
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,637
But what are its properties?

43
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:00,890
Well, first of all, it doesn't depend on which bond

44
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,400
we look at.

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,520
It's going to be the same thing for all of the bonds.

46
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,130
And it represents the extra return

47
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,039
that we get per unit of randomness,

48
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,710
per extra coefficient of dB.

49
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,750
Unfortunately, it's not observable.

50
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,810
And it ends up being a fudge factor in lots of models.

51
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,530
This happens whenever the stochastic driver is not

52
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,480
something that's directly tradable.

53
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,610
That's where this uncertainty comes from.

54
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,240
In the case of our stock and our stock option,

55
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,670
the stock price was directly observable.

56
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,310
And we didn't have any ambiguity.

57
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,180
So common approaches are either to figure out

58
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,920
something that seems like it ought to be

59
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,450
a reasonable functional form.

60
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,960
We'd make or look for something that can be solved analytically

61
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,020
or to try to make empirical fits to market data.
