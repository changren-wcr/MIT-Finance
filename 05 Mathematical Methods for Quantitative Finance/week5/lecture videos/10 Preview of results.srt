00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,560
PROFESSOR: In order to solve the Black-Scholes equation, which

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,967
is a pretty complicated differential equation,

3
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:08,300
what we're going to do is make some changes of variables

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,900
to turn Black-Scholes into a related equation that's

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,290
a lot easier to work with and easier to understand.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,190
We'll take a look at some of its features,

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,815
and then we'll transform back and we'll

8
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:21,380
get our final answer in terms of the original Black-Scholes

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,540
variables.

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,830
So let's just preview some of the key results

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,600
and what our key approach is going to be,

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,350
how we're going to go about doing this.

13
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,190
So the first thing is what equation are we talking about?

14
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,350
The Black-Scholes PDE is closely related

15
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,860
to the diffusion equation, a well-known partial differential

16
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,560
equation, which is written in this way

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,300
as the partial of a function we'll call p0 with respect to t

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,890
is equal to 1/2 the second derivative.

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,560
So I have the first derivative on the left hand side.

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,580
I have second derivative on the right hand side,

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,920
and these both have the same sign.

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,200
If I put them on the same side of the equation,

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,230
there's going to be a minus sign relative to the two.

24
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,280
What's the solution to this equation?

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,530
Well, there are a lot of them.

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,520
But there's one that's very, very special.

27
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,490
That solution is a Gaussian, and that's one I've called p0.

28
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,130
So right now you should take a moment

29
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,650
to check that this expression satisfies this differential

30
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,610
equation.

31
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,710
You'd like to practice your partial derivatives,

32
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,020
there's no better time to do it right now.

33
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,820
You can see it's a little bit complicated

34
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,310
because this Gaussian where we've done Gaussians

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,500
before, it's easy to differentiate

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,700
with respect to z.

37
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,290
There's z squared up here.

38
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,240
But the t's appear in two different places.

39
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,580
They appear down here and they appear over here.

40
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,740
And the effect of t's appearing in

41
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,280
that way is that as t plays the role of sigma squared,

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,650
it's related to the width of the distribution.

43
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,540
As t gets larger, the Gaussian gets wider and wider.

44
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,510
And I've illustrated this here, that the peak gets lower,

45
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,577
the distribution gets larger.

46
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:58,160
One of the really interesting features

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,310
is that t approaches 0, the opposite happens.

48
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,740
The Gaussian gets steeper and steeper

49
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,000
and gets peaked near the origin.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,800
So the first thing is simple differential equation.

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,370
Very interesting Gaussian, our old friend the Gaussian.

52
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,370
Special solution to that differential equation.

53
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,650
And we're going to use that special solution

54
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,900
to generate other solutions.

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,930
So the way in which we do that is going

56
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,300
to be a kernel type approach.

57
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,260
And I'll show you some examples in a moment

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,170
and you'll have a chance to do some yourself.

59
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,830
But the basic idea is that we find a function p.

60
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,500
It has a special form, and in this case, it's a Gaussian.

61
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,160
And if we want to find any particular solution that

62
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,980
has special boundary conditions, what we do

63
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,320
is we take our function p.

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,750
We're going to integrate it times something representing

65
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,150
the boundary conditions to get the thing that we want.

66
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,680
So in the case of stock options, what we're thinking about

67
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,220
is this expression here is going to be the replacement for p0.

68
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,530
This is going to be some complicated expression,

69
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,880
but it's going to be the moral and variable transformed

70
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,530
equivalent of p0.

71
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,200
This expression here is going to define

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,350
the payoff of the derivative at expiration.

73
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,900
Usually when we look at partial differential equations,

74
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,773
we think of initial conditions or of boundary conditions.

75
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:22,190
And if we have initial conditions,

76
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,200
we think about what happened subsequently.

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,280
In the case of financial derivatives

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,420
that have a definite expiration date, we work time backwards.

79
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,210
We know what they're worth in the future at expiration,

80
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,390
but we need to figure out what they're worth at times prior.

81
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,610
What this expression does is it lets

82
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,040
us convert from one to the other and look

83
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,100
at the structure of it, because we'll be seeing this again.

84
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,650
The integration variable is with respect

85
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,640
to this St over all possible future terminal

86
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,470
values of the stock price.

87
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,650
But this function here, p, depends not only

88
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,820
on St and big T on the values at termination.

89
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,410
It also depends on the current stock

90
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,090
price and the current time.

91
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,450
And because these are variables outside but they're

92
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,080
constants under the integral, this p function

93
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,360
is going to give us a bridge between the two,

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,720
between the terminal values and the present values.

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,149
And we're also going to see that the same equation,

96
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,860
the diffusion equation, describes

97
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,800
a bunch of other things, including

98
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,630
the evolution of probability distributions for random walks.

99
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,230
It helps us solve problems for the presence of barriers

100
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,420
for things like exotic options, knock in,

101
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,320
knock out options, and so on.

102
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,600
We'll get some good intuition about how those behave.
