00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940


1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,620
PROFESSOR: So let's try a few examples

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,810
to check that this trick really looks like it should work.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,890
And then we'll be all set to take a look both at

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,130
how and why it works, and how we can apply it to solving

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,760
the Black-Scholes equation.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's try a couple of examples.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,570
If we take a look f of z equal to z squared,

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:33,770
then what our rule says is we should have p of zt

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:42,240
should be the integral of 1 over square root 2 pi t

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:50,630
e to the minus z minus z prime squared, z prime--

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,900
oops.

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,780
Let's leave it in red.

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,780
z prime squared dz prime.

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,140
And if we do that Gaussian integral we find the result.

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:13,970
This is equal to z squared plus t.

16
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,720
And let's check that.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:24,080
Well, p of z at t equals 0 is z squared.

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,810
So that part works.

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,850
This part matches this part.

20
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,960
That's good.

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,300
Does it satisfy the differential equation?

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,310
What does the differential equation say?

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,280
The differential equation says that partial

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,780
of p with respect to t minus 1/2 second partial of p

25
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,110
with respect to z squared should be equal to 0.

26
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,800
Is it?

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,170
Well, partial of-- here's our expression.

28
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,360
The partial with respect to t is 1 minus 1/2 times

29
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,450
the second partial with respect to z.

30
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,250
First partial is 2z, the second partial is 2,

31
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,539
and it's equal to 0.

32
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,080
Shall we do another one?

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:21,760
Let's try f of z equals cosine of lambda

34
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,410
z, where lambda is a constant.

35
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,460
So then we do the integral.

36
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,850
We find the p of z, t by doing the Gaussian integral.

37
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,150
And you can do this by looking it up in a table book,

38
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,150
you can use Mathematica, or you can

39
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,893
break the cosine into complex exponentials

40
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:41,935
and complete the squared.

41
00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:44,440
There are a variety of techniques for doing this.

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,870
When you do the integral, we find that this

43
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,130
is equal to-- let's see.

44
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:55,720
We have-- this is the integral of p0 of z minus z prime t.

45
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,020
That's our old friend, the Gaussian.

46
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,510
Times cosine of lambda z.

47
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,020
Of course, my integrals, unless specified otherwise,

48
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,030
go from minus infinity to infinity.

49
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,770
That's a z prime.

50
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,910
dz prime.

51
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,620
And this integral, when we do it,

52
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,920
is equal to e to the minus lambda squared t, or 2 times

53
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,560
cosine lambda z.

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,190


55
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,460
So let's take a look at this expression and see,

56
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,350
does it satisfy the differential equation?

57
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,890
Does it satisfy the initial conditions?

58
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:45,735
p of z, t as t goes to 0 equal to cosine lambda z.

59
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:47,040
So that checks.

60
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,670
And how about the derivatives?

61
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,320
Well, the partial of p with respect

62
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:00,310
to t minus 1/2 partial of p with respect to z squared.

63
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,400
Partial of this expression with respect to t

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,013
gives us from this exponential, e is here.

65
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,680
When we differentiate with respect to t,

66
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,050
we're going to get a minus lambda squared over 2,

67
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,830
going to get--

68
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,040


69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,710
it's going to be minus lambda squared over 2 times

70
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:31,440
the function itself, times p of z, t, and minus 1/2

71
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,920
times the second partial with respect to z.

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,500
Well, the derivative, the first derivative

73
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,570
of that function with respect to z

74
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:46,980
is e to the minus lambda squared t/2 times lambda minus sine.

75
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,830
And the second one is going to bring down another lambda,

76
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,840
and the sine will turn into a cosine,

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:00,260
and we'll be left with minus 1/2 times minus lambda squared

78
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,970
times the function itself, p of z, t, all of which

79
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,530
is equal to 0.

80
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,870
So those are two instances that we've

81
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,920
checked so far in which doing our integral formula

82
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,220
generates something which is a completely reasonable function.

83
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,410
It has the desired properties that we

84
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,140
wanted when t is equal to 0, and it's

85
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,840
got some time dependence for t greater than 0 for what

86
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,160
goes on.

87
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,140
Finally, let's look at one more example

88
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,020
that's actually relevant for option pricing, that's

89
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,830
a closer example.

90
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,700
So let's take a look now at what happens if we have f of z

91
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,380
is equal to what we'll call the step function, theta z

92
00:05:43,380 --> 00:06:05,690
minus kappa, where theta z is defined to be 1 for z

93
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,695
greater than zero and z for z less than zero.

94
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:11,570
It's a step function.

95
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,000
It goes long for 0, and then it goes up,

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,050
and then it's equal to 1.

97
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,770
So it's 0 for negative numbers, it's 1 for positive numbers.

98
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,930
That's what we'd like to have as t goes to 0.

99
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,360
And in this case then, that means

100
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,640
that our integration, our integrand,

101
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,180
is going to be our Gaussian times the function 1,

102
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,920
but the integral's going to be cut off.

103
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,140
So this says that p of z, t which

104
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,570
is going to be the integral, remember, of p0 of z minus z

105
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:54,230
prime t times f of z prime dz prime,

106
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,000
is going to be equal to 1 over square root of 2 pi

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:14,410
t times the integral of e the minus z minus z prime squared

108
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:23,162
over 2t times dz prime.

109
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:24,870
And what about our limits of integration?

110
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,800
Well, this is only going to be nonzero for,

111
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,500
and this is the part I wanted to have in yellow,

112
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,420
starting from kappa to infinity, not from minus infinity

113
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,100
to infinity.

114
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,630
So we can rewrite this in terms of a variable.

115
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,970
Let's define a new variable.

116
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:53,745
Let's let u equal z minus z prime over square root of t.

117
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:56,850


118
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:03,990
So du is going to be minus dz prime over square root of t.

119
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,370
Remember that inside the integral, z and t

120
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,470
are both constant.

121
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,310
So now I can write this integral as the integral is going to be

122
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:19,830
equal to 1 over square root of 2 pi, which is a constant,

123
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,440
from minus infinity to a value we'll call u*,

124
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,260
of e to the minus u squared over 2 du.

125
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,650
Now, this expression is the cumulative distribution

126
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,845
function, or the Gauss integral.

127
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:39,970
That is, instead of integrating from minus infinity

128
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,370
to infinity, where we get 1, we're

129
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,360
integrating from minus infinity up to some particular value.

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,920
And this function, this definite integral

131
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,210
which doesn't go to infinity, has a name.

132
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,210
And well call it, we'll give it a notation

133
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,040
that we'll be calling this phi.

134
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:11,480
So we will define this to be phi of u*.

135
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,510
And when we substitute back to our original variables,

136
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:22,630
we find that this is going to be equal to phi z minus kappa

137
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,140
over square root of t.

138
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,080
So phi is this incomplete integral.

139
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,420
It's the thing which when we differentiate it,

140
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,460
we get the probability density, because we

141
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,070
differentiate with respect to the upper limit

142
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,160
of the integral.

143
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,760
And in this case, what we get is an integral that's

144
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,860
cut off at the lower bound where we have the cutoff in our step

145
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,595
function, our initial function here.

146
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:55,170
Our function-- excuse me, forgot my pointer--

147
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,940
our initial function right here.

148
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,540
So our initial function says that we've

149
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,840
got theta is 1 where z in excess of kappa

150
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,910
and it's 0 below kappa.

151
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,430


152
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,520
So that's the solution when t equals 0,

153
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,230
and the solution for arbitrary times is given here.

154
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,900
Now, this one we need to be careful.

155
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,710
Because in the limit where t goes to 0,

156
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,530
we need to be quite careful about how this behaves.

157
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,620
Because the function is a smooth function,

158
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,970
but it's going to approach a step function.

159
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,660
So what happens is this function is going to behave

160
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,020
more or less like this--

161
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,440
if we can draw this.

162
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,550
Then we're going to go from minus 1 to 1

163
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,690
for the phi function.

164
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,750
But as t goes to 0, this function

165
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,990
is going to become steeper and steeper,

166
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:59,240
and eventually approach a step function, which

167
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,000
has a discontinuity that we put in at the beginning.

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,030
But for larger values of t, it's a completely reasonable

169
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,520
function and a very smooth function.

170
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,730
So we've done three examples of our basic rule

171
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,070
from our equation, which says that we

172
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,720
can use our special Gaussian solution to generate arbitrary

173
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,590
solutions.

174
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,090
And how are we going to apply that

175
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,290
for option pricing given the kernel that we have,

176
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,940
given this function p0?

177
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,710
And we'll find the correct version of it

178
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,700
for the Black-Scholes equation.

179
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,390
It says if you want a price not just a call option,

180
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,970
but a put option or a straddle or something

181
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,180
with some exotic pay-off, all you need to do

182
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,820
is take the same integrand, change

183
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,935
the function-- the payoff function-- do the integral,

184
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:47,810
and then you're done.

185
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,600
And this will generate all possible solutions

186
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,640
to the differential equation for the values

187
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,560
of option prices, derivative prices that

188
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,500
are consistent with these financial principles.

189
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,000
