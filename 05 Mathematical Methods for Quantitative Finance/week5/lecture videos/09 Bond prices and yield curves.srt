1
00:00:00,746 --> 00:00:02,380
PROFESSOR: So let's put it together

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,420
and see what we can say about bond prices

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,350
and about yield curves.

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,620
So the bond pricing equation we have now,

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,270
under the set of assumptions we have,

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,910
takes this general form, where we

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,970
have some unknown parameters, alpha and y bar, that we

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,470
might fit from the data.

9
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,080
Let's assume that we've got this particular form.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,210
And to solve this equation, we look

11
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,340
at separation of variables.

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,090
And we're going to try Ansatz, which

13
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,548
means that we're just going to take

14
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:28,360
we're going to guess a particular form

15
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,720
as a starting point and then see if we can refine what

16
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,130
those choices are.

17
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,160
The formal pick is inspired by the general idea

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,610
that bonds, if there were no randomness

19
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,140
and things were constant, should see

20
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,660
an exponential behavior in time and a linear dependence

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,980
in the exponent on the risk-free rate.

22
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,010
So let's assume that the function

23
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,120
y is in the form e to the f of t that depends only on t

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,040
and a term that's linear and y.

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,930
So we have a time-dependent function,

26
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,100
which is independent of y, minus y times another function

27
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,780
that's also independent of y.

28
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,410
And what we're going to do is apply the boundary conditions.

29
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,100
So the question we can ask is, in

30
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,330
this simple one-factor model, what kind of prices do we get?

31
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,910
What kind of term structures do we get?

32
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,988
Do we only get a rigid term structure?

33
00:01:18,988 --> 00:01:20,530
Do we have different parameters where

34
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,322
we can have things that are upward sloping,

35
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:24,700
inverted curves, oscillating?

36
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,000
So what's possible?

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,320
What's not allowed?

38
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,020
That would be especially interesting.

39
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,040
And do we have enough degrees of freedom in our parameter

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,500
choices and in our model specification

41
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,790
to fit the market?

42
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,960
Well, in this particular example,

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,270
we can take a look at fit for some particular numerical

44
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,900
examples.

45
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,150
And depending on how we tune the parameters,

46
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,670
we can get a variety of behaviors.

47
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,000
We can get a curve which is upward sloping.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,150
We can also generate a curve which is downward sloping.

49
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,320
And we can even generate a curve which is inverted,

50
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,130
which begins by being convex, rising,

51
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,620
and then becomes downward sloping.

52
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,259
So there are a variety of behaviors we can have.

53
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,520
This is the simplest model.

54
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,250
And it's a bit too simple for applying to the real world.

55
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,430
But this shows you how we can apply these techniques to match

56
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,220
different kinds of assumptions about processes

57
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,870
to observable bond prices and their yields in the marketplace

58
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,140
and then use what we observe in the marketplace in turn

59
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,490
to go back and try to find what might be appropriate not

60
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,770
only Ito process for the short rate

61
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,860
but how many other factors might be required

62
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,630
or advisable to include in our modeling.
