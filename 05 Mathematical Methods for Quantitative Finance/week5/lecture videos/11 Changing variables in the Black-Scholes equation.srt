1
00:00:00,643 --> 00:00:03,060
PROFESSOR: Now, to get from Black-Scholes to the diffusion

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,160
equation, we make a few changes of variables,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,010
which are not obvious at all.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,480
And I'm going to show them to you,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,040
and you're free to check them out

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,690
or you can take my word for them.

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,790
I'll explain where each of them comes from.

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,070
The first change of variables that we have

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,740
is to replace V by a present value factor in front

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,270
and to change the value.

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,520
That is, instead of writing things for the derivative,

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,030
we can express things in terms of its forward or future value.

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,750
So we know that there's discounting

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,710
should take place, at least for people who've taken 15415.

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,540
You know how that works, how we look at present value.

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,500
And one of the ways that we can simplify our equation

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,050
by combining terms is simply to put

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,920
in a discount factor in terms of the derivative itself.

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,200
And if we do that, we eliminate the one

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,970
term in the Black-Scholes equation

21
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,030
they didn't have any derivatives, the minus rV term,

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,130
and we can have this expression here in terms of U.

23
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,310
The next thing we can do is substitute for time

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,630
and for the stock price.

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,970
In terms of the stock price, what we're going to do

26
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,095
is we're going to introduce a logarithmic variable.

27
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:14,790
And we've already seen that in many ways rather than price,

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,595
the logarithm of price or the differences of logarithms

29
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:20,340
of price are much more natural variables.

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,320
Because what matters from an investment point of view,

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,990
from an informational point of view

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,860
is how stock prices change, not with the absolute levels are.

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,900
And the natural variable for capturing

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,970
those in a continuous time setting

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,590
is a logarithm of the price.

36
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,550
But this is just a change of variables.

37
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,870
So we'll call S. We'll replace it by E to the xi

38
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,570
or we'll let xi equal the logarithm of S.

39
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,230
And that will help simplify the equation.

40
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,210
The tip off that we might see that when

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,670
we look at the structure of our differential equation

42
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,190
is to notice the structure of these terms here.

43
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,940
Where this is an S d by dS and this

44
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,600
has an S squared with a second partial with respect to S

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,380
squared.

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,690
Because this has an S and a derivative with respect to S,

47
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,039
this is two S's and two derivatives, those behave

48
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,940
like logarithmic derivatives.

49
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,840
So the logarithmic derivatives simplify things,

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,210
and they'll transform this so that instead

51
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,660
of having this pre-factor S and this pre-factor S squared,

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,680
we won't have anything.

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,405
We'll just get an equation with constant coefficients.

54
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:25,530
The other change we'd like to make at the same time

55
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,150
is in our time variable.

56
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,580
And instead of measuring time forward,

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,410
we're going to measure time backwards

58
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,490
counting back from potentially an option expiration.

59
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,910
And the tip off for that is the relative sign

60
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,130
that we have between the time derivative

61
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,350
and the second derivative with respect

62
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,150
to the independent variable with respect to the underlying.

63
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,880
Now, notice that if I change S to minus S,

64
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,000
not only to negative prices not make sense financially,

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
but this equation, this part wouldn't change.

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,960
But there's a single time derivative here.

67
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,500
So changing the direction of time matters a lot.

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,070
Now, this actually works out fantastically well for us.

69
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,500
Normally for partial differential equations,

70
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,630
we look at how things evolve forward

71
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,060
and the relative sign that we would want

72
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,428
would be a minus sign.

73
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:14,970
Here there's a plus sign, which would

74
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,270
make it much more difficult to interpret and to solve.

75
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,150
But it turns out that the conditions we want

76
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,560
are the backward conditions.

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,090
We know the terminal values.

78
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,050
We want to find out what happens before.

79
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,690
So let's make this substitution.

80
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,007
We'll let tau equal t minus big T some fixed constant minus t.

81
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:35,340
Because this is a constant and we're making derivatives,

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,360
the big T isn't going to matter.

83
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,460
It's not going to show up.

84
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,950
And in fact, big T really will only

85
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,670
reappear when we impose boundary conditions on our equations.

86
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,940
So if we make those changes to variables,

87
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,960
we find that we get this expression.

88
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,930
We now have a derivative with respect

89
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,250
to a timelike variable, a relative minus sign,

90
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,020
a second derivative term with constant coefficients,

91
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,470
and then this piece over here with our interesting minus

92
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,970
sigma squared over 2 that we've seen

93
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,000
before times the first derivative piece.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,765
And we can make that part go away as well.

95
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:08,640
So let's clean it up.

96
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,920
Finally, with one more change that

97
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,040
will absorb a single derivative term in our change of variable,

98
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,019
and let's introduce this variable x.

99
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,820
You'll notice that this logarithm, this log of S

100
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,870
plus this other piece in tau, if we were to exponentiate it,

101
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,150
if we were to exponentiate this whole expression,

102
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,130
you'll notice this should look familiar from the form

103
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,070
that we saw for the geometric Brownian motion.

104
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,940
And we looked at the integral of the stochastic differential

105
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,720
equation.

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,920
We had an expression just like that.

107
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,010
So it's not that the natural variable

108
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,270
is log S. Really the natural variable looks

109
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,830
like logarithm of S, E to the R tau minus sigma

110
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,390
squared tau over 2.

111
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,730
So either way, whether you like cleaning up the mathematics

112
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,710
or whether you're inspired by the form of the SDE

113
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,920
that we saw earlier, if we make that change a variable,

114
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,930
we're left with this expression now

115
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,690
which looks exactly like our diffusion equation

116
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,330
with a diffusion constant.

117
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,190
This is standard in literature sometimes

118
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,720
to have the constant sigma squared

119
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,540
that's here known as the diffusion constant.

120
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,620
We can make that go away as well by absorbing it into tau so

121
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,380
that the combination that always will appear would be sigma

122
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,640
squared tau.

123
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,050
And by redefining that, we could make it go away.

124
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,010
So there would be no extra coefficients at all.

125
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,270


126
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,280
We can check that this particular form

127
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,810
does satisfy that equation.

128
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,480
So let's take a look at this special solution.

129
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,200
This is like the p0 that I showed you before.

130
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,600
Again, it's an exercise in differentiation.

131
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,340
If you didn't do the earlier one,

132
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,380
you can follow along with this one.

133
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,500
So here's my definition of U. The only difference

134
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,080
is the sigma squared that shows up, and as I said,

135
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,190
always in this combination, sigma squared tau.

136
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,440
So we take one partial derivative

137
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,640
and we see it brings down a pre-factor with respect

138
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,670
to U, because it's exponential.

139
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,530
The second partial derivative with respect

140
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,640
to x, partial derivative with respect to tau,

141
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,750
and then we can equate these expressions.

142
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,470
So we see that the partial with respect to tau

143
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,980
is sigma squared over 2 times the second partial with respect

144
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,480
to x.

145
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,500
That's our diffusion equation.

146
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,000
