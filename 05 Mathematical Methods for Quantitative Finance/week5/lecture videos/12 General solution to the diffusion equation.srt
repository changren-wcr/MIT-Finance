1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,220
PROFESSOR: Now here is an integral formula

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,040
that tells us how to use the special function

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,050
p0 to get a general solution to the differential equation that

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,690
satisfies arbitrary initial conditions.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:20,850
So imagine that at time t equals 0, we want our function p of z

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,080
and t that satisfies the diffusion

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,220
equation to have some particular functional form f of z.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,890
It could be something like f of z equals z squared.

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,470
It could be a cosine.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,840
So you pick a function f of z, and the question

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,260
is, can we find a time dependent function that

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,750
satisfies the diffusion equation such that when t is equal to 0,

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,190
it takes the particular form that we want.

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,550
If we can do that, getting the solution

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,770
to the Black-Scholes equation is going to be a piece of cake.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,650
And here's how it works.

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,560
We put in our function p0 where we take

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,772
a difference of the variable.

19
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:00,980
That is, we're going to have an integration variable.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,860
We're going to integrate over all possible z

21
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,580
primes of our special function for our initial conditions

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,020
f of z prime.

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,260
And then we're going to multiply that against a kernel function

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,510
against what's known as a Green's function

25
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,300
our special p0 where we're substituting

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,000
for z the difference between z and z

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,520
prime where z is the outside variable

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,530
and z prime is the variable of integration.

29
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,690
So if we were to differentiate this with respect to z,

30
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,230
the only z appears here, and it's not integrated over.

31
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,170
So we can bring a derivative inside the equation.

32
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,960
Similarly, if we want to integrate with respect to time,

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,880
this integral is not over time.

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,420
z prime is a dummy variable for integration.

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,910
If we want to differentiate this with respect to time,

36
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,180
this is the only place where time appears.

37
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,490
So let's take a look at a couple examples,

38
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,700
and you can check that this actually works.

39
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,650
If we substitute in our particular expression for p0,

40
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,970
here's our rule.

41
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,623
We've got 1 over square root of 2 pi t, which

42
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:06,290
I put in front because it doesn't depend

43
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,280
on z prime, exponential of minus z minus z

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,560
prime quantity squared over 2t times f of z prime dz prime.
