PROFESSOR: What kinds of Ito processes

1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,670
might we use for looking at the short rate?

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,210
So we've seen how given an Ito process for the short rate,

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,640
we can get a differential equation,

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,670
a partial differential equation for bond prices

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,850
in terms of this unknown market price at risk.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,950
But we do have a whole bunch of relationships

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,370
that hold in order to avoid arbitrage among the bonds,

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,640
and it gives some hope of seeing a structure for the yield

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,550
curve.

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,850
So there's a huge literature on different kinds

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,210
of models for the spot rate, and here are a few examples.

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,270
So just to take a look at a few of them,

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,650
the Ho and Lee model starts with an arbitrary function of dt

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,590
plus a constant Brownian term.

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,170
So there's a time-dependent, deterministic first term

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,210
that corresponds to the drift part,

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,610
to the return part of an Ito process,

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,830
and a random part fixed volatility.

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,030
So we can determine new arbitrage prices.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,050
And then by picking different functional forms of psi,

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,200
we can try to fit observed market prices if we think

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,330
that the markets are efficient in our pricing

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,430
and taking into account these relationships correctly.

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,580
So one way that we might do that is

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,000
to take a look at observed market prices

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,930
and then try to fit a curve through this,

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,720
take some derivatives of this in such a way

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,340
that we can determine a psi of t that yields prices--

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,130
no pun intended-- that yields prices

30
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,030
that hopefully, fit the yield curve reasonably well.

31
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,310
So that's a way to kind of match existing market data.

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,630
The Vasicek model is a single-factor model

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,540
that has mean reversion built into it.

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,740
And you'll recognize this as being the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,990
process that we looked at in the continuous time

36
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,480
analog of an autoregressive time series model.

37
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,580
So in this model, there's also a constant term,

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,200
but there's a definite specific form for the coefficient of dt.

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,419
It's not some arbitrary function psi.

40
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,450
It's a particular form, and it says that interest rates

41
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,240
are mean reverting.

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,240
The Hull and White model kind of tries

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,940
to combine the best of both of the above.

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,560
So it has a mean reversion term plus an arbitrary function,

45
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,200
and it lets us model the yield curve

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,930
and have some structure for volatility.

47
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,600
The CIR model, the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model,

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,490
takes a different twist by modifying the dB term

49
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,650
and taking a look at how the effective volatility may

50
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,760
depend on the levels of interest rates.

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,100
So how do we proceed?

52
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,220
You pick your model, you pick your Ito process,

53
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,540
and then you solve your bond pricing equation.

54
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,520
You look at the market.

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,510
You see what you like.

56
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,010
If you don't like it, you come back here,

57
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,670
you pick another one, and you start again.

58
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,460
And if you don't like any of these models,

59
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,180
you can start with your own.

60
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,970
So the methodology goes this way.

61
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,070
We're connecting a particular postulate for an Ito process

62
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,860
that drives one of the random factors--

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,170
in this case, these are single-factor models--

64
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,710
and then we solve for prices consistent with principles

65
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,260
of no arbitrage.

66
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,880
So for example, if the spot rate follows an OU process,

67
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,580
and the market price of risk is assumed

68
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,410
to be constant or linear--

69
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,720
so this eta function, I'm just putting an arbitrary, c0 or c1,

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,540
you can set one or the other of them to 0 if you'd like.

71
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,790
We can do a little bit of arithmetic with the function

72
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,660
f in terms of the a and b parameters for the structure

73
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,840
of our Ito process from our bond-pricing equation,

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,310
and we can see what kind of equation that we get.

75
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,450
We can look at estimating the model parameters

76
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,690
either from looking at dynamics of the short rate

77
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,310
or by taking a look at observed bond prices.

78
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,690
So here, I've introduced the a prime and a y prime

79
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,910
just to be rescaled parameters based

80
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,913
on some estimates we might do.

81
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,330
The details aren't that important.

82
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,750
It's just to show you that the overall structure that I get

83
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,220
can have a form that's of the same overall form, something

84
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,149
that's linear in the spot rate, which is the same structure

85
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,510
that we have up here in our original process.

86
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,800
So the reason we do this as opposed to something simpler,

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,830
like Brownian motion or geometric Brownian motion,

88
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,640
is that interest rates, unlike stock prices, don't diffuse.

89
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,150
They don't go all over the place.

90
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,460
In fact, they don't vary that much at all.

91
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,890
So mean reversion is an interesting starting place.

92
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,920
The idea is the rates might change,

93
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,010
but maybe they stay in a given neighborhood for a while.

94
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,990
Certainly, over the last long period of time,

95
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,910
the rates have been pretty close to 0.

96
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,170
But the idea is that instead of having a strict bound--

97
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,260
say, a zero bound for interest rates or an upper bound

98
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,180
beyond which they can't go--

99
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,820
we see that the diffusion model isn't a good model.

100
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,780
But by having a mean reversion factor, like the Vasicek model,

101
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,870
it's the dynamics that keep it from going.

102
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,300
There's something always pulling the interest rates back.

103
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,670
Now, that does mean that we need an estimate for what

104
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,420
the parameters are for this mean to which they're reverting.

105
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,662
Is there some long-term average that we should use?

106
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:22,620
Is there a different way we can think about it?

107
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,230
So those are part of the estimation

108
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,670
question for this model.

109
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,520
And we can ask if we're thinking about what things should

110
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,190
be long-term, or if we're thinking about empirically,

111
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,650
what works best in terms of the set of option

112
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,070
prices and the yield curve that the model produces.

113
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,930
But suppose we do take this structure,

114
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,550
and we just want to do the mathematics

115
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,800
and see what we can get by applying the Ito

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,490
calculus to this setting.

117
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,960
So let's take a look.

118
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,000
So we've got this general structure.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,750
So we have that dy is some constant times y bar minus y--

120
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,310
that's our mean reversion term--

121
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,110
plus sigma dB.

122
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,780
Now, one of the things that we can do that's convenient

123
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,110
is to transform the variables.

124
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,630
So let's use Ito's lemma to change from variable y

125
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,350
to variable z where we'll put in an exponential dependence.

126
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,990
And we're not surprised by that, because we would think

127
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,570
that if the model were purely deterministic,

128
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,830
we would have a long-term average interest rate,

129
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,010
and we might expect to see exponential behavior.

130
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,540
So if we just plug that in and turn the crank,

131
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,320
we see that we get this expression for dy.

132
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,210
We make this substitution for y and z.

133
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,370
And then we see that we can write dz

134
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,250
in terms of an exponential prefactor

135
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,880
out in front, times something that looks like a random walk

136
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
with constant coefficients.

137
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,560
So this is not a random walk.

138
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,480
But in terms of the z variable, we've

139
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,640
turned it into something that looks like it

140
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,230
has some similar properties.

141
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,300
And the advantage of this is not that we're

142
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,000
going to get diffusion where we didn't have any before.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,780
The point here is that by having this be an exact differential

144
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,550
and this have constant coefficients,

145
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,060
we have a chance of integrating the last integral.

146
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,790
So if we integrate that SDE, what

147
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,530
do we find for the behavior?

148
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,138
We find that z can be written-- the evolution of z

149
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,680
from an initial starting point that's

150
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,990
an arbitrary constant, z0, can be written in this form where

151
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,850
we can now study what happens as t goes to 0

152
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,800
and as t goes to infinity for a long time.

153
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,880
So what we see is when we turn things, we solve for z,

154
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,100
we do the integral in terms of z.

155
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,528
And then we substitute back to get y.

156
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,320
And what do we see?

157
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,640
We see one term, initially y0, and this term

158
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,700
decreases exponentially with time.

159
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,140
This term here, as time goes on, the e to the minus

160
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,230
at goes to 0, and this approaches y bar.

161
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,050
And now we see that by combining these two terms,

162
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,030
that if sigma were equal to 0, we

163
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,880
would have something that would begin at any y0,

164
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,120
and it would relax over time to reach

165
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,550
y bar as t goes to infinity, which

166
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,340
is what we would expect for our mean reversion process

167
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,350
in the absence of volatility.

168
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,060
There is volatility, though.

169
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,990
And we have this term in dB, which is

170
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,610
a sequence of random variables.

171
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,973
And therefore, writing it out in this way,

172
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:25,390
it looks like it's in closed form.

173
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,640
But, of course, that interval over dB

174
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,440
is itself a random variable.

175
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,770
It says that dB's need to be weighted

176
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,309
by the exponential prefactor at different steps along the way.

177
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,820
So this is an expression for y.

178
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,200
We can ask about the moments of its distribution.

179
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,929
That's the full y.

180
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,030
We know it's related to a Gaussian,

181
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,570
because the infinitesimal dB's are Gaussian,

182
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,340
but we have this time-weighted average of dB's.

183
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,830
But we certainly can compute the mean and variance

184
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,010
of that expression.

185
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,130
So if we take the mean for the long-term value,

186
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,330
we see that because the expectation is linear,

187
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,020
the dB term goes away, and we're just left with this expression

188
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,610
that I mentioned before for how the long-term average behaves

189
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,080
and how it starts at y0, and it relaxes as t goes to infinity,

190
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,050
to reach y bar.

191
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,590
In terms of the variance, we apply our definition.

192
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,740
The variance is the expectation of y minus its own expectation,

193
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,090
quantity squared.

194
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,860
We multiply it out.

195
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,100
We end up with double integrals of our products of dB.

196
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,330
We use our Ito rule, which says that dB

197
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,680
at time s and dB at time s prime are uncorrelated

198
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,890
with each other, unless their times coincide,

199
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,680
in which case, their variance is dt.

200
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,780
So we can do the integrals, and we

201
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,540
find a time-dependent variance.

202
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,980
And t goes to infinity, we're left with the constant result

203
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,380
in terms of the initial parameters of the model,

204
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,650
sigma squared-- remember, sigma was the coefficient

205
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,030
of our Brownian term--

206
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,590
sigma squared over 2 alpha.
