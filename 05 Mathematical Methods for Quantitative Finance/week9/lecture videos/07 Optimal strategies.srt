00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860


1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,090
PROFESSOR: So we take a look at the minimum cost solution.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,130
And we find in this case, that we

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,530
do get a solution for dividing things

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,760
into equal cost for the moment.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,610
But hang on, we'll generalize this in a bit.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,970
So for that very special set where all we want to do

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,950
is to minimize the expected cost,

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,390
we do have a solution where the trade we with each size

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,530
is 1 Nth of the total fraction.

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,300
So this is a linear trajectory that minimizes the squares that

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,190
we had, that sum of delta Q's.

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,650
And we can substitute it in.

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,740
We get an expression for what the expected cost is

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,696
under this program that minimizes the total cost.

15
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:43,360
The variance of this though, can be very big.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,900
So given our program for equal size,

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,820
we get a very large variance.

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,290
And again, this variance is going

19
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,880
to persist even in the limit where N goes to infinity

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,710
and we have a large number of trading periods.

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,600
As N goes to infinity, we've got a finite cost,

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,330
which now is linear in Q. And we have a variance,

23
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,030
which is quadratic in Q. Excuse me,

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,680
the expected cost is determined it's linear and quadratic in Q

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,400
, and a finite variance, even as we spread our trades out

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,600
infinitely far.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,965
Suppose we wanted a minimum variance strategy.

28
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:21,590
Well, we'd dump all our shares at once.

29
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,660
We'd incur an immediate cost.

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,760
And here, our variances 0.

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,980
Our market impact is going to be very big. .

32
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,610
And our associated cost is very large.

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,140
Suppose we like an optimal strategy

34
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,180
that balances those two.

35
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,990
Suppose we'd like to include some compensation

36
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,460
and multi-function so that a risk-averse trader is not just

37
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,190
going to be indifferent to the trading speed.

38
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,720
So let's make it so that it's advantageous to not

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,910
delay an infinitely long amount of time.

40
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,360
Let's assume that it's not good to allow fluctuations,

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,490
even if they're equally likely to be positive or negative.

42
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,660
And what we'd like to do is we'd like to have a lower cost,

43
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,930
but we don't want to let the variance be arbitrarily large.

44
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,360
So one way we could do that is we

45
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,750
could introduce utility function of this form.

46
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,080
It could be the expected cost plus some function,

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,720
some constant lambda, times the variance.

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,990
So we get two special cases--

49
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,240
the minimum impact response to letting lambda equals 0.

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,430
We want the lowest cost.

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,930
We don't care about the variance.

52
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,750
Or we have the minimum variance by letting

53
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,300
lambda go to infinity, and we don't

54
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,860
care about what the cost is.

55
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,560
So for intermediate values of lambda,

56
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,540
we're going to have a one-parameter family

57
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,310
of optimal trading strategies.

58
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,235
And those are going to form an efficient trading frontier.

59
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:48,290


60
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,650
We can solve this in closed form in, the case, linear functions,

61
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,850
for g and h.

62
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,160
Let's take a look at the form that those have.

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,470
Our function, U, our utility function

64
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,290
that we're going to extremize, is

65
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,550
going to have the form of some constant times delta Q squared

66
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,670
plus some other constant involving

67
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,760
the constants of the problem, and proportional to lambda

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,630
times Q squared.

69
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,730
So we're going to take a minimum with respect to Q

70
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,630
and set it equal to 0.

71
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,212
And we have this set of difference equations

72
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:21,920
that comes about from the fact that we've

73
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,770
got these delta Q's here in addition to the q's over here.

74
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,870
So this is of the form of a second difference equation.

75
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,670
This is a discrete equation, but it's

76
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,090
a discrete analog to something that looks like a second order

77
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,310
differential equation.

78
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,270
So we've got this general form.

79
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,430
We'd like to find a functional form

80
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,910
that solves this recursive equation

81
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,700
and that satisfies these boundary conditions.

82
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,390
Well, I'll tell you what it is, and you can substitute it in.

83
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,910
You can solve for this by taking a look at guesses

84
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,040
of particular forms or by looking

85
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,290
at the similar kind of cases that we have

86
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,920
for differential equations.

87
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,390
But you can check the solution here,

88
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,930
which is a linear combination of positive and negative

89
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,990
exponentials satisfies this second order difference

90
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,800
equation.

91
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,090
And it satisfies the boundary conditions.

92
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,750
So when t goes to 0, this is 0.

93
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,700
When t goes to big T, this satisfies the condition

94
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:33,020
that we have our property boundary condition.

95
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:40,250
So because we're selling, when i is equal to 0,

96
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,610
we've got N minus i is equal to N

97
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,180
and delta t is equal to big T, the numerator and denominator

98
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,270
are equal and we get Q.

99
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,070
And we get to our terminal value,

100
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,140
i increases linearly here.

101
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,490
But it's not a linear function.

102
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,530
It's inside this parabolic sine.

103
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,060
But when we do approach not continuously,

104
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,150
but we approach gradually, the terminal value,

105
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,030
where the final trading value at the end, quantity

106
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,040
that we have left at the final value

107
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,030
is going to be 0, where i is equal to N and then

108
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,710
the numerator is equal to 0.

109
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,440
I've redefined the parameters because we

110
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,770
had this eta hat that from one of our trading functions

111
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,440
and lambda, which is our preference parameter.

112
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,080
And I've wrapped those all up into a single new parameter

113
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,160
called kappa.

114
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,300
It's defined by this equation.

115
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,140
So kappa is defined through this equation,

116
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,450
but you can see it's just a constant here.

117
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,340
And qualitatively, we can ask what

118
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,060
this trajectory looks like.

119
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,270
So is it a set of linear slices?

120
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,490
Do we just end up dividing our trades equally?

121
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,960
The answer is no.

122
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,900
We end up with something that looks a little bit differently.

123
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,320
The trajectories are defined for each period in each lambda.

124
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,680
And depending on whether we have positive or negative risk

125
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,350
aversion, in this case, depending on the values

126
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,830
that we have for lambda, if we have positive risk aversion,

127
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,690
then we'll find this lower curve,

128
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,280
something that looks like this.

129
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,590
That cinch function tells us that

130
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,990
instead of a risk-neutral idea, where

131
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,030
we would have equal trading strategies,

132
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,060
we want to start out big and then gradually decrease

133
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,260
our trade size.

134
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,860
So it turns out that there's a particular shape to this curve.

135
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,170
It does satisfy this endpoint.

136
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,870
So we end up with 0 at this point in time.

137
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,950
And the speed of trading depends on the amount of risk aversion

138
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,960
that's in the value of lambda.

139
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,290
So for a given set of parameters and a given

140
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,040
set of risk preferences, we solve an optimization problem.

141
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,850
It gives us how we should trade over time in order

142
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,240
to balance the market impact that lowers

143
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,720
or that it increases our cost of trading.

144
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,920
And the balance is not against the risk, the uncertainty

145
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,285
of doing things for a longer period of time

146
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,910
if we were to stretch things out to try

147
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,730
to minimize our market impact.

148
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,320
Finally, because this is a one-parameter family of curves,

149
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,630
we can take a look at this.

150
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,600
Almgren and Chriss plotted this is an efficient frontier

151
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,530
for trading.

152
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,950
But we can say as a function of our parameter lambda,

153
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,090
where do we want to be?

154
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,700
The naive strategy at B, the equal slicing strategy,

155
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,490
has the lowest total cost.

156
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,880
But the efficient frontier is this one-parameter family

157
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,790
of strategies where there's an optimal strategy

158
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,430
for each value of lambda that you might choose to consider.

159
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,000
