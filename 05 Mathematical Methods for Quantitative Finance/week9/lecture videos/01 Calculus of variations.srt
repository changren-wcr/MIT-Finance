1
00:00:01,105 --> 00:00:03,730
PROFESSOR: So let's take a look at another kind of optimization

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,460
through what's called the calculus of variations, that

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,060
is actually behind ideas like dynamic programming,

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,520
even though it doesn't always get credited that way.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,640
And it's a global view and often gets

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,240
discretized in things like Bellman's principle

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,920
of optimality for dynamic programming.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,410
So here's the idea.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,130
The idea is suppose that we've got some function that's

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,350
going to represent a kind of policy, something

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,060
that we decide over time.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,800
For concreteness, the examples that we're

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,070
going to be looking at are going to involve trading policy.

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,110
So imagine that you're a trader.

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,920
Your job is to trade a large block of shares.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,350
So you've got 100,000 or a million shares of stock,

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,110
and you need to trade them over a given period of time.

18
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,250
So the amount you trade at a given point in time

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,750
or the amount perhaps, that you have an inventory in a given

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,510
amount of time might be a quantity q,

21
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,380
which is some function of time.

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,310
And the idea is how should you vary q

23
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,800
as a function of time in an optimal way.

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,300
What are the considerations?

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,190
Well, if you dump all your shares at once,

26
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,690
you're going to get a worse price.

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,273
Because people will know you're there.

28
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:11,230
There's not enough liquidity in the market.

29
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,570
If you go really slowly on the other hand,

30
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,440
you'll incur a lot of risk.

31
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,350
So if there are different trade offs,

32
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,020
we can capture those in a function that

33
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,060
involves penalties for the different things that

34
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,760
might go wrong, and ask about solving

35
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,930
for a policy as a function of time.

36
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,700
This is very different from solving for a single scalar

37
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,110
variable at a point.

38
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,140
What we're doing is we're asking about something

39
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,160
that we're varying with respect to a function, a function

40
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,970
of time.

41
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,590
And we want to solve for a function.

42
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,760
So how do you differentiate with respect to a function?

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,350
This is a classical problem, and I'd

44
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,330
like to show you a simple example in just

45
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,890
a couple of pictures.

46
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,410
And as I said, we're not going to be using this directly.

47
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,600
But you will see the flavor of this

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,130
in some of the applied problems if we look at,

49
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,980
for solutions to the problem of optimal trading.

50
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,500
So the first thing is to consider

51
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,380
that we have a function, q of t, which

52
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,270
is what we're going to control and what we want to solve for.

53
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,290
And we're going to let the Lagrangian now, be

54
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,010
a function of q and of its first time derivative,

55
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,320
which I'll call q dot.

56
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,330
So q dot represents dq/dt.

57
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,200
OK, and we're going to construct a function called the action,

58
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,550
but that's just the name.

59
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,650
It's a S. And we're going to integrate

60
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,160
this function across time.

61
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,640
And we're going to consider S as a function of functions.

62
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,150
So S is a function of different q's.

63
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,120
If you pick a different trajectory, q of t,

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,690
stuff it into L, along with a time derivative,

65
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,770
q dot, you'll get a different number.

66
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,240
So what we want to ask is, given a particular functional form

67
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,350
of L. And given an arbitrary function of q, I can compute S.

68
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,910
And I want to know what function q,

69
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,730
gives me the minimum value of S.

70
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,290
So here's how we're going to do it.

71
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,080
First, we're going to characterize our deviations.

72
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,960
How do we average over all possible functions?

73
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,620
Well, here's one way we could do it.

74
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,300
Let's start with the particular q

75
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,450
and look at it as a one parameter family of deviations.

76
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,230
So let's let the alpha just be a parameter scalar

77
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,440
that we can vary.

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,530
And we'll say that when alpha is 0,

79
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,140
we have our starting function.

80
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,980
And we're going to vary it in proportion

81
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,130
to some other unknown function, x of t.

82
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,710
So x of t is arbitrary, but what we'd like

83
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,810
is at the endpoints of the integration, when

84
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,040
t is equal to 0 or big T, at the initial or the terminal point,

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,720
that this deviation part, alpha xt should vanish.

86
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,850
So for arbitrary alpha, we're changing q

87
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,130
in the direction of the function x.

88
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,380
But we're leaving the endpoints fixed.

89
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,630
Now you could say, well, you just move the problem

90
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,910
from an unknown q into an unknown x.

91
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,890
And that's true, but what we're going to see

92
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,530
is it's not going to depend on which x we pick.

93
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,050
So let's just substitute this informally.

94
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,970
Let's see what we get for our results.

95
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,160
And then we'll apply to a couple of simple examples.

96
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,850
So I'm going to substitute, this expression,

97
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,440
this alpha-dependent expression for q into my integral for S.

98
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,640
And I'm going to say that an optimal solution would

99
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,570
be when the derivative of S with respect to alpha varnishes.

100
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,870
That is, at least over this particular direction

101
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,230
for varying q, I'm varying q in the direction

102
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,420
of a particular deviation x of t--

103
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,010
It's a time-dependent function.

104
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,250
I don't know what it is.

105
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,060
But certainly, if this is going to be stationary,

106
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,240
if it's going to be a critical point, then as I very alpha,

107
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,920
this should be equal to 0.

108
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,440
So I'm going to take dS d alpha.

109
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,450
And I'm going to apply the ordinary chain rule.

110
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,283
That's going to be partial of L with respect

111
00:04:57,283 --> 00:05:01,440
to q times partial of q with respect to alpha, plus it also

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,110
depends q dot, partial of L with respect to q dot,

113
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,320
times partial of q dot with respect to alpha.

114
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,300
And the whole thing is integrated dt.

115
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,540
And in more general cases, L might be more complex.

116
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,600
And sometimes it's given an explicit time dependence.

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,540
We're just going to look at this simple form.

118
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,140
It's just a function of q and q dot.

119
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,470
And we're q and q dot as being independent for the moment.

120
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,770
Now, let's substitute.

121
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,110
We know that the partial of u with respect to alpha.

122
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,150
Here's q.

123
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,340
So I take the partial with respect to alpha.

124
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,810
It's just x of t.

125
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,830
So this first line, I have partial L with respect

126
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,600
to q times dq d alpha, is just partial

127
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,520
of L with respect to q times x.

128
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,310
And in the second term, the partial of q

129
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,140
dot with respect to alpha, well, q dot is dq/dt.

130
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,650
So the partial is just going to be dx/dt.

131
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,190
It's going to be the derivative of x with respect to time,

132
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,400
times this part is unchanged that's in front.

133
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,570
Now let's do an integration by parts.

134
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,350
Let's take the second term, integrate by parts,

135
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,390
and move the t derivative over to the left-hand side.

136
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,930
So instead of t acting on x, I'm going

137
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,170
to get d by dt acting on the first term.

138
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,950
As usual, when I do integration by parts, I have a minus sign.

139
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,360
And I have a boundary term I need

140
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,390
to consider as well, which has this form-- partial of L

141
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,090
with respect q dot times x, evaluated

142
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,570
at the end point the integral, t equals big T to t equals 0.

143
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,240
Now the boundary term for my integration by parts

144
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,030
vanishes, because x vanishes when t

145
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,560
is that either the end points.

146
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,450
That's the condition I add here.

147
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,450
And now this term the remains has

148
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,500
the quantity in square brackets, all multiplied times x of t.

149
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,190
Integrated dt is equal to 0, and in this equation,

150
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,410
has to hold for any function, x of t

151
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,590
that you might choose to consider.

152
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,460
Well, the only way that can be true for any x of t

153
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,370
is if the quantity of square brackets vanishes.

154
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,870
And that gives us what are called

155
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,830
Euler-Lagrange equations.

156
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,840
So the Euler Lagrange equations satisfy the condition

157
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,540
that the action is stationary when q is such

158
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,480
that it satisfies this equation-- partial of L

159
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,350
with respect to q minus the derivative with respect

160
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,860
to time, the total derivative with respect

161
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,610
to time with the partial of L with respect

162
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,525
to q dot needs to vanish.

163
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,150
And this is well known to people who've

164
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,980
studied classical mechanics.

165
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,140
For example, this gives a different way

166
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,320
of formulating Newton's second law, F equals Ma,

167
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,080
force is equal to mass times acceleration.

168
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,830
Here's how we do it.

169
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,070
We take a look at constructing Lagrange here.

170
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,360
We think of q as representing the position of a particle,

171
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,940
q dot is representing its velocity.

172
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,460
And q double dot, the second derivative with respect

173
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,370
to time, as representing the acceleration.

174
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:05,150
Here is our functional form for L. It looks like the energy.

175
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,890
We'll that V be the potential energy.

176
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,770
But notice, this term looks like kinetic energy--

177
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,180
1/2 m q dot squared, minus some function of q

178
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,470
that's independent of q dot.

179
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,680
If this were the energy, there would be a plus sign here.

180
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,003
And it has a minus sign.

181
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:21,920
In any event, if you're not familiar with this

182
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,990
in classical mechanics, just take it

183
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,390
as a particular functional example.

184
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,770
Let's apply the rules.

185
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,007
Partial of L with respect to q dot is going to be just--

186
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:33,799
this is the only term with the q dot in it.

187
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,480
It's going to be m times q dot.

188
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,539
Partial of L with respect to q it's

189
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,880
going to give me minus derivative of V

190
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,219
with respect to q.

191
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:45,230
And that tells us, when I substitute it

192
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,890
into this equation, that m q dot, which is mass times

193
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,430
acceleration, is minus the prime of q,

194
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,730
which in classical mechanics, is equal to the force.

195
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,375
Specifically, if we take a problem where V of q

196
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,630
is quadratic in q, this represents a harmonic

197
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,320
oscillator.

198
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,080
We have that the force is minus kq.

199
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
It represents restoring force.

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,130
If q gets large and positive, the force

201
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,810
is in the negative direction.

202
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,960
And I'm going to get this very concrete differential equation

203
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,740
and q double dot minus kq.

204
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,130
And the solutions to this are sines and cosines,

205
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,550
which you can check, satisfy the equation, with the frequency

206
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,240
given by square root of k/m where k and m are

207
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,680
primary for the problem.

208
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,410
K showed up in the potential, V. M showed up

209
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,720
in our original Lagrange function here, as m.

210
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,420
So that's an example as to how we

211
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,450
can get a differential equation out of this general principle.

212
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,780
But what it tells us is not just this

213
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,940
is how a harmonic oscillator behaves.

214
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,720
It tells us that of all possible things that a harmonic

215
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,320
oscillator could do, not the ones that actually does,

216
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,155
all the things that could do, the correct solution--

217
00:09:57,155 --> 00:10:00,050
the one the Newton tells us is the right solution--

218
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,650
also happens to be the one that minimizes

219
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,210
this interesting integral here.

220
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,660
So it turns out that while Newton's equations

221
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,140
are pretty good, that we can generalize this principle

222
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,170
to many, many more problems than the specific differential

223
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,180
equations that Newton came up with.

224
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,900


225
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,578
Here's another example.

226
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,495
This is from the paper from Almgren and Chriss

227
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:25,150
that we'll look at more, which is

228
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,450
about optimal ways of dividing a trading solution.

229
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,500
Their key idea is to take a look at penalizing both trading

230
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,858
fast, because of the high market impact that

231
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:36,400
would be incurred if you try to trade

232
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,090
a large block of shares too quickly, and inventory risk--

233
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,970
that is if you hang on to your shares for too long,

234
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,860
there's market risk that they might change in value.

235
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,100
Now in their solution, they end up

236
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,660
with something which is discrete.

237
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,830
They do a multi-period problem.

238
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,850
But if we were to take the continuous time limit,

239
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,740
we could replace their discrete sum

240
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,860
by the integral that would have this general form, which

241
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,100
looks an awful lot like the harmonic oscillators solution

242
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,660
we just saw that looks like Newton's equations.

243
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,620
So they have a term in delta q, which represents

244
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,600
the change in the quantity.

245
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,240
It represents the speed of trading.

246
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,510
And they have a term that ends on q squared, which depends

247
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,290
on the quantity that's left.

248
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,980
So we see we have an action term in this interval.

249
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,320
We have something that depends on q dot squared,

250
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,450
something that depends on q squared,

251
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,570
just as we did in our example from Newtonian mechanics.

252
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,690
So it's very similar, except that the harmonic oscillator

253
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,960
would have the wrong sign.

254
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,940
This would be a repulsive force.

255
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,940
So it wouldn't be a very sensible for a harmonic

256
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,880
oscillator.

257
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,700
But the mathematics goes through almost the same way.

258
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,120
The difference is that the solutions instead

259
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,480
of being sines and cosines, are exponential with a plus

260
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,620
or minus sign.

261
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,360
And when we impose boundary conditions,

262
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,230
we find a particular linear combination of them

263
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,860
that involves a plus sign an a minus sign in this form that

264
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,560
involves hyperbolic functions.

265
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,510
But it's basically a linear combination

266
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,960
of the two solutions.

267
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,210
So in this picture, we have a problem

268
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,110
that was formulated initially as a recursive problem, very

269
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,780
discretely, about what happens over small periods of time.

270
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,740
But we have a trade-off between the desire

271
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:23,290
to minimize risk and improve speed at a short distance,

272
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,010
with a global problem where we need an optimal global solution

273
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,950
that might not necessarily be an iterated set

274
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,470
of myopic, short-term solutions.

275
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,000
And the calculus of variations tells us how to do that.

276
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,170
It says solve the entire trajectory all at once.

277
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,260
And these are examples of what those solutions look like.
