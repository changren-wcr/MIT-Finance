00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,078


1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:02,620
PROFESSOR: In order to express things

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,650
in terms of known quantities, we used recursion relations

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,920
for the price and for the inventory remaining, which

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,980
are pretty simple.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,700
So if I've got a Wt and a future point

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,620
I don't know that necessarily.

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,580
But I can express it certainly, in terms of Wt minus 1

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,470
and qt minus 1, which is the thing that I

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,710
wanted to vary and choose.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,810
And similarly for the price, I can

11
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,580
express the relationship between p of t minus 1 and t minus 2

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,790
in this way, using the recursion relation for the price

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,760
evolution.

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,610
So if we substitute that into the results

15
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,075
from the previous slide, you get a whole bunch of algebra to do.

16
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:41,703
But when we combine the terms--

17
00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:43,120
so what we're going to do is we're

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,740
going to substitute that in.

19
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,050
We're going to compute the expectation.

20
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,390
Computing the expectation, we're always

21
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,860
going to track where the random variables appear,

22
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,650
the only randomness that's going to appear

23
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,015
in the epsilons, which appear in the price coefficients

24
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,390
So we're going to look everywhere

25
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,810
where there's a price it appears with an uncertainty for what

26
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,520
the future price variation is.

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,260
That's going to contribute non-trivially

28
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,760
to the expectation.

29
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,070
Once we've computed the expectation,

30
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,630
there's no more randomness.

31
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,090
But there is dependence on the control variable,

32
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,250
in this case, q of t minus 1.

33
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,690
We minimize that.

34
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,315
And here, we can see that we're going to minimize this.

35
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:23,110
And this has a quadratic form plus some constant that's

36
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,010
leftover.

37
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,080
So the minimization term is going

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,330
to involve minimizing a quadratic form.

39
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,280
The reason it's quadratic does come

40
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,710
from our choice of a linear cost impact function

41
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,620
at the beginning.

42
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,410
So for more complicated functions,

43
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,650
the algebra in the derivatives get a little bit more

44
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,250
complicated.

45
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,730
But the general idea is what we see here.

46
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,450
So we want to minimize that quadratic function

47
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,100
and find our decision variable.

48
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,810
When we do that, the constant doesn't matter.

49
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,920
And what we find is our decision variable for our next

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,900
to last period, is that what we should do

51
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,340
is we should trade half the remaining shares.

52
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,530
So that's the solution.

53
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,310
That's an output.

54
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,110
That's not a guess.

55
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,050
So we've got that this should be half the remaining shares that

56
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,400
minimizes the function that we saw on the previous slide.

57
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,180
We take this result, and we plug it in to evaluate the function,

58
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,940
assuming that we've made that optimal choice.

59
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,440
And we get a new expression for the value function

60
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,640
in terms of state variables that are known at time t minus 1.

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,980
We know what the previous observed price was.

62
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,840
We know what the inventory was.

63
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,640
And now by substituting in our optimal solution for q hat,

64
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,950
we can express things this way.

65
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,400
And this is the value that we'll have

66
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,250
a time t minus 1 under the assumption

67
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,440
that we're going to follow an optimal policy

68
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,670
for the remaining two time periods.

69
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,270
So this is the desired closed form expression.

70
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,780
It depends only on the two things I've written here--

71
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,710
the price and on the inventory, which we know.

72
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,060
Well, let's keep going.

73
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,763
So there's going to be more algebra.

74
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,180
But it's going to be the same idea

75
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,380
until we get to the beginning.

76
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,440
We use one more step.

77
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,100
We do a substitution for our inventory.

78
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,310
We write out our expectation.

79
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,760
We do the expectation by identifying each occurrence

80
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,260
of the random variable.

81
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,740
We regroup terms so that we can group things in terms

82
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,350
of W times something with p.

83
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,880
So we group the W's together.

84
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,590
We group the p's together.

85
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,760
We minimize by varying the q's for the next time period.

86
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,980
We find that this also gives us a quadratic function.

87
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,160
The solution to this quadratic function

88
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,660
is going to be that the optimal trade at time t minus 2,

89
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,030
two periods before the terminal value,

90
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,020
is going to be 1/3 of the remaining inventory.

91
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,890
We keep going.

92
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,420
We substituted it in.

93
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,910
We get our new value function at this point.

94
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,980
Again, it's a function of p.

95
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,350
It's a function of W that are known.

96
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,660
And as a term that's linear in p,

97
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,050
terms that are linear and quadratic and W,

98
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,220
it's just the coefficients that change.

99
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,490
So as Bellman set out and as we hoped we would find,

100
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,090
the structure of the problem is the same in each period.

101
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,550
In each time period, we have to do the same thing--

102
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,310
compute an expectation, minimize,

103
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,019
and substitute variables.

104
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,930
And in each time period, we have a formula

105
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,730
that's got the same structural form as the one before.

106
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,640
So we know how to solve it each time.

107
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,200
It's just the details that change

108
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,310
a little bit in each period.

109
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,350
So we keep going.

110
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,610
And we find that at each time step,

111
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,740
we have the same solution.

112
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,700
We get a quadratic in every period.

113
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,360
And each time, we got some fraction

114
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,570
of the remaining shares that's going to decrease linearly

115
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,310
with the number of time steps that are remaining.

116
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,470
We take that value.

117
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,910
We substitute it in.

118
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,420
And for our arbitrary k, we find that we get this result.

119
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,050
It's something that's quadratic in W. It's linear and p.

120
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,410
The only thing that's changing is this k dependent coefficient

121
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,350
as we go.

122
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,500
We keep going all the way back to the beginning

123
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,990
to where k is the t minus 1.

124
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,790
And we're back in the initial period.

125
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,610
And for the initial period, we solve that.

126
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,340
We find that q hat in first period

127
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,600
is W1, which is our whole inventory divided by t.

128
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,730
In that's just Q/T. So what our solution has told us--

129
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,520
and here's our optimal value that we have here,

130
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,460
again is the same structural reform that we had before,

131
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,080
something that's linear in p.

132
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,540
It's quadratic in W1.

133
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,180
And therefore we found the first trade

134
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,150
size is 1/T for the total.

135
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,790
The second trade size is 1/(T-1) of the remainder.

136
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,670
So the optimal solution that we found

137
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,060
is we should divide up our trade quantity into equal slices.

138
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,430
And you might have guessed that as a starting point.

139
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,913
Why don't we start equal?

140
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:56,330
But here, we've shown that there's

141
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,900
a balancing between the uncertainty

142
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,210
that we have in the time periods and the market

143
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,630
impact that we have.

144
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,750
So the market impact that we have--

145
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,840
remember, if we trade too fast, we're

146
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,910
going to incur a high market impact that

147
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,250
then is going to affect the subsequent trades.

148
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,580
And we're looking for the balance between them.

149
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,900
In this particular case, with this special choice

150
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,880
of market impact function, we've gone

151
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,420
through these steps are the same steps you would do.

152
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,860
If you'd like, you can try it out,

153
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,520
going through with a more complex market impact function.

154
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,560
For example, a quadratic market impact

155
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,920
function instead of a linear.

156
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,840
The expected cost at the initial time--

157
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,830
therefore, we can go, and now we can substitute back in.

158
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,463
Because we know what the expected quantities

159
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:45,130
are going to be.

160
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,410
We know what the quantities traded

161
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,700
are going to be in each period.

162
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,283
We don't know what the prices will be.

163
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,700
But we do know what the market impact is.

164
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,750
So if we substitute that in, we find

165
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,170
that we're going to get the expected value of Q/T

166
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,880
times the sum of the prices.

167
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,460
This comes out because our trade quantities are actually

168
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,430
constant.

169
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,060
And then we can move the expectation inside

170
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,370
and look at the sum of the expected prices.

171
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,270
If we do that, we're going to get sum over little t

172
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,620
from 1 to big T.

173
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,420
We can do this sum explicitly.

174
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,565
It's just T(T+1)/2 .

175
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,830
And we got our final result, which

176
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,680
is that the term involves what we would have

177
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,060
had if there were no frictions.

178
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,220
If theta were equal to 0, we would have just

179
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,800
had the total quantity times the initial price

180
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,430
plus an expected part that's due to the transaction costs.

181
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,330
And this piece is quadratic in Q, in the total quantity,

182
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,160
not in the quantity done individual period.

183
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
So it's proportional to theta, which

184
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,990
is our market cost parameter.

185
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,580
And its quadratic in the number of shares.

186
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,940
So under this solution, the minimum cost solution

187
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,780
is to trade equal slices to divide up our trade.

188
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,730
If it's over 10 days, we do 1/10 per day.

189
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,550
But we find that the market impact,

190
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,470
relative to a frictionless trade,

191
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,740
relative to the mark to market value of a portfolio

192
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,470
is going to be quadratic in the number of shares.

193
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,690
Market to market is a standard way

194
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,240
of accounting for the value of an investment, where

195
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,110
we look at what the quantity is that we hold in an account.

196
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,820
And we multiply times the market price.

197
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,870
And that means the value on a market to market basis

198
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,480
assumes that it could be liquidated with no impact

199
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,200
costs.

200
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,110
And that's not a fair assumption for almost

201
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,130
any non-trivial investment.

202
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,460
So this tells us there's a significant deviation

203
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,880
between the actual expected liquidation cost

204
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,380
and/or acquisition cost in this case, where we're buying--

205
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,570
this it's q squared.

206
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,070
This would be the same if we're market to market or selling.

207
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,920
But the expected acquisition cost

208
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,515
is going to be a function that's quadratic in Q.

209
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:52,170
And that's going to differ from what the market to market cost

210
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,740
would be, which would simply be the first term this expression.

211
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,510
So we can compute with the expected transaction costs are.

212
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,790
It does depend on the number of time periods.

213
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,260
So if we were to spread this out over more time periods,

214
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,710
t, the longer we spread it out, the lower we

215
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,590
can make the transaction costs but even the limit

216
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,950
where we do it over an infinite number of time periods,

217
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,130
the total transaction cost is going to be finite.

218
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,500
And it is going to be proportional to Q squared.

219
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,130
If we compare with say, trading everything

220
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,110
in the initial period, we can see

221
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,850
that we would have incurred a higher transaction costs.

222
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,450
So if we doped all our shares in period one,

223
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,150
we would have ended up with a cost that would have also

224
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,320
been proportional to Q squared, but without the factor of 1/2.

225
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,190
So by this particular case, by slicing our trades

226
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,490
and spreading them out over time, we can lower the costs.

227
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,420
And we can lower them as much as by a factor of 2, but not more

228
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,330
than that.

229
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,120
So in both cases, we have market impact.

230
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,050
But by optimally executing our, trades

231
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,270
we can cut the transaction costs in half.

232
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,510
So to summarize what we've seen for the Bertsimas and Lo

233
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,020
solution for optimal trading, the cost of optimal execution

234
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,490
is half the cost of immediate execution.

235
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,360
The cost is quadratic in the total trade quantity.

236
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,700
If the quantity is small, then Q squared might be small.

237
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,170
But the impact is permanent.

238
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,110
So the idea is that each trade we do

239
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,940
leaves its mark on the subsequent trades.

240
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,990
And that's why these quantities build up

241
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,240
and why it's important to work from the end

242
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,560
back to the beginning.

243
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,330
There are a lot of things that we left out of this analysis.

244
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,450
So this model is quite specialized.

245
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,460
And you can generalize it to more realistic cases.

246
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,510
It doesn't account for things like a temporary market

247
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,200
impact that might go away.

248
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,390
That's often the case in markets where we're looking dynamically

249
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,920
over multiple time scales.

250
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,370
It doesn't penalize the opportunity costs of delay.

251
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,380
After all, if we're buying the shares,

252
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,810
maybe we're not just buying them for liquidity reasons.

253
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,018
Perhaps we're buying shares because we have a signal.

254
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:05,360
We know we have good forecast for the future price.

255
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,130
We think that the value is going to go up.

256
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,180
And the longer we wait, yeah, we might get a lower cost.

257
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,720
But we might lose out of the expected gain in the returns.

258
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,760
So perhaps we should include that in our trade

259
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,730
off as well, the opportunity cost of waiting.

260
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,550
We're not penalizing for risk, for volatility

261
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,810
in the final value.

262
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,300
And we're not really asking about

263
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,910
whether this particular trader or investor has

264
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,270
different preferences, different risk tolerances that

265
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,810
might favor faster or slower execution.

266
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,540
But it is an example of using dynamic programming

267
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,850
to get a recursive structure for the problem,

268
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,750
finding an optimal policy so that we know before we even

269
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,600
begin what our actions will be in the future,

270
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,470
subject to all of the conditions that we might find along

271
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,844
the way.

272
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:53,344
