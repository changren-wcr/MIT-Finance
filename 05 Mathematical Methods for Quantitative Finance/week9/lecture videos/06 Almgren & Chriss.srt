00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,870
PROFESSOR: Techniques for finding optimal policies can

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,770
be broadly applied for finding optimal strategies

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,120
in a wide variety of settings.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,680
The space of optimal trading strategies

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,060
looks at how we might devise trading in a world

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,330
where there's some uncertainty about the environment, where

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,090
there may be adversaries on the other side who are trying

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,930
to thwart our optimal methods, and where

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,990
we may try to define an optimal policy

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,000
subject to a number of things that are

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,960
unknown about the environment.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,820
So what we'd like to do is come up with an optimal policy.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,610
But these models are also helpful for exploring

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,310
how marketplaces work and how there's

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,570
an interplay between, possibly, different kinds of agents,

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,340
different kinds of actors who might have

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,310
different sets of preferences, different information sets,

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,180
and so on.

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,580
So we can use strategic models to take

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,160
a look at market structure to look

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,070
at even features of developing models for market

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,210
microstructure.

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,530
Where does liquidity come?

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,120
From where do bid offer spreads come from?

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,070
How do prices actually come to incorporate information?

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,950
When it comes to practical strategies for a trader

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,860
or portfolio manager, the starting point

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,900
is to think of what your objective is.

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,880
What is it you would like to optimize?

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,890
Do you want to minimize your costs?

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,770
Maybe if you're a trader acting as an agent for a client,

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,390
that should be your objective.

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,460
If you're trading on your own account,

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,000
you might have a concern where you

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,740
would like to minimize your costs,

36
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,580
but you also don't want to give up opportunity costs if you're

37
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,280
trading for a reason, and you might have a trading signal

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,510
that decay, for some reason.

39
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,750
Do you want to minimize your risk?

40
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,710
Do you want to maximize your utility?

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,230
What are the constraints that you're subject to?

42
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,800
So we need to think about what it is we want to extremize,

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,040
and then we want to define policy variables we have

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,500
under our control, state variables

45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,170
that we need to monitor that would affect our decision,

46
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,170
and we need models for how the state variables would evolve

47
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,280
in time on their own, absent our participation, just

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,030
in the general environment and how they respond to the control

49
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,870
decisions that we make.

50
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,380
So one common way to approach this

51
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,850
is to look at minimizing the cost for a given level of risk

52
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,390
subject to, perhaps, the expected utility function that

53
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,898
reflects what our risk preferences are so

54
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:28,440
that it could be a general class that

55
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,330
might be different for different people

56
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,700
with different preferences.

57
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,280
So let's consider this case, where

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,105
we want to buy or sell a block of shares for little quantity q

59
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:41,540
and at time t.

60
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,070
Let's divide the total trade horizon into n sub-periods.

61
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,430
Let's allow it to be invisible, possibly without the t

62
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,210
going to 0.

63
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,060
But let's think of this as being finite because we typically

64
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,760
are trading in finite periods.

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,818
Trades are discrete.

66
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:58,610
The time periods don't need to be discrete.

67
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,220
But let's imagine that we're at least re-evaluating

68
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,460
the possibility of trading at regular intervals delta t.

69
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,650
We can always choose not to trade.

70
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,560
Trade quantity in a given period could be 0.

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,850
But the available trading times we'll denote by t sub k,

72
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,790
which are going to be at k delta t in clock time,

73
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,870
where k will go from 0 up through n.

74
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,400
Let's let q sub k be the amount that we hold at time k.

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,990
And we'll have boundary conditions

76
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,360
that-- let's say that we're selling a block of shares

77
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,200
this time.

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,890
And in this case, we're going to start with initial value big Q.

79
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,450
And we're going to decrement until we

80
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,370
get to a terminal value in our final period at-- of 0.

81
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,640
So the amount that we trade in a given period of time

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,410
is going to be delta qk.

83
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,050
It's just going to be the change in shares between one

84
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,470
period and the next.

85
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,170
And that's where we get to decide.

86
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,870
So part of our strategy, part of our policy,

87
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,780
part of our optimal solution and program

88
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,450
is going to be to determine sequence delta

89
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,660
k so that the shares add up to the total number q

90
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,180
that we sell over this period of time.

91
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,700
So a strategy, a solution, to this optimization problem

92
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,700
is find an algorithm that assigns values delta qk based

93
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,730
on, at each time stop, the information that's available

94
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,300
up to that point in time.

95
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,900
So what we need to do is devise a set of rules

96
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,550
you could hand off to someone.

97
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,518
You don't know what the future prices are.

98
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:28,810
You do have a model for what their stochastic evolution

99
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,530
might be.

100
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,400
But that way, someone could take your set of instructions.

101
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,740
At any point in time, they could say, aha,

102
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,330
I've got this many shares left.

103
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,250
Here's the price that I observe.

104
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,420
What should I do?

105
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,760
In the example of Bertsimas and Lo,

106
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,250
we saw that, actually, the optimal program

107
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,780
didn't depend on the prices.

108
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,060
It didn't-- it was the same thing no matter what.

109
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,920
It was just due to equal trading.

110
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,890
So that was a very stylized example.

111
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,090
More generally, it could depend on things

112
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,900
that evolve that are not yet known at the beginning,

113
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,930
and that's what we want to do when we devise a strategy.

114
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,190


115
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,070
So what price process might we use for trading?

116
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,110
We're going to look at a specific example.

117
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,700
It was developed by Almgren and Chris optimal trading policies.

118
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,550
So let's take a look at their assumptions.

119
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,910
And I encourage you to take a look at their original paper.

120
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,170
So for the drift rate, the--

121
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,240
during the price period, we're going

122
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,580
to think about this as a short-term trading

123
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,350
example, where the drift rate is going

124
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,200
to be taken to 0 as an initial approximation.

125
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,740
So we're not going to include the opportunity costs.

126
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,390
Those could be added later.

127
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,380
That might be a reasonable example.

128
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,270
It might not.

129
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,920
But we're going to do this to simplify the mathematics.

130
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,430
So one immediate specialization we're making

131
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,040
is to have no draft, just randomness.

132
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,240
And this is an obvious generalization

133
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,990
that you can make and redo the derivation to take a look at.

134
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,900
We're going to let the price process diffuse so

135
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,550
that there will be randomness.

136
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,830
And we're going to allow there to be market impact so

137
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,290
that our trading affects the final price.

138
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,440
So really, if we're setting up typical elements

139
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,560
of an optimization problem, we like

140
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,820
to get the realistic details.

141
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,830
But the minimum ingredients that we need

142
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,530
are two things that we want to minimize,

143
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,790
which are at odds with each other.

144
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,590
That's the basic feature we have.

145
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,960
So in this case, we're not minimizing the opportunity

146
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,460
cost.

147
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,320
We're leaving out that one leg.

148
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,690
But we do have two other legs that will give us

149
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,110
a non-trivial problem.

150
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,360
One of them is that we want to minimize risk.

151
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,140
The other is we want to minimize cost.

152
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,370
And those two are going to conflict with each other.

153
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,210
So we're going to assume that there is a speed of trading

154
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,290
that we could define.

155
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,440
Let's think of a variable delta q over delta t.

156
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,800
And we're going to assume that our market impact is a function

157
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,310
of the trading speed.

158
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,670
The more we trade in a given time period,

159
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,830
the higher the market impact.

160
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,360
We're also going to allow for a two-part market impact model.

161
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,460
We're going to think of there being permanent,

162
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,980
as well as temporary, market impact.

163
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,310
A permanent impact affects all future trades.

164
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,070
And a temporary impact affects the price

165
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,870
that you get in that period.

166
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,540
You might think of it as being due to order book structure,

167
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,300
due to the fact that you need to cross the bid offer spread

168
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,150
and go deeper in the order book than the initial price.

169
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,400
But it won't affect the next trading period

170
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,810
because liquidity might be replenished.

171
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,600
So there are two possible things.

172
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,700
Obviously, you can specialize, where you set

173
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,670
one or the other of these to 0.

174
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,530
But let's include a two-part model market impact.

175
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,420


176
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,300
So the market impact shows up in the pricing evolution

177
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,290
with a model that looks like this.

178
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,710
Let's assume that the price in one period

179
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,470
is given by the price in another period plus two components.

180
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,600
One of them is a random movement.

181
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,200
So zk is going to be a random variable.

182
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,140
Sigma is going to be the volatility associated

183
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,780
with the change in delta square root of delta t--

184
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,740
so what we'd expect for sigma square root of delta t--

185
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,470
to be the size of the shock that we would get

186
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,960
during a time period delta t.

187
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,505
And that's the diffusive part.

188
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,880
And we're going to assume that we have a permanent market

189
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,360
impact that's some function g.

190
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,000
And our assumption is it only depends on the rate of trading.

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,670
It doesn't necessarily depend on the number of shares

192
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,650
that we have in inventory because that's not

193
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,850
known by the market.

194
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,480
The amount that we push into the market in a given time period

195
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,760
will be seen by the market.

196
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,650
Those are the shares that we expose.

197
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,110
And those might realistically be modeled

198
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,030
as affecting future periods.

199
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,520
And the impact that we have is going

200
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,280
to be some function that depends on the rate at which we're

201
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,740
trading times the size of the time period

202
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,550
if we have the same rate over a longer time interval.

203
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,070
We're going to have a larger market impact.

204
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,660
And we'll also include that there

205
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,080
might be a temporary market impact that just affects

206
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,410
the price during a particular period that affects

207
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,710
our execution costs for one set of trades,

208
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,220
but not for the subsequent time periods.

209
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,800
So we have g represents a function of arbitrary form.

210
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,600
We'll pick some examples so we can solve this later on.

211
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,810
But g represents permanent market impact.

212
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,960
h represents temporary market impact

213
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,620
that we might have for the short term.

214
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,160
So we like to look at the total trading cost.

215
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,710
And obviously, we'd like to minimize

216
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,640
what we lose relative to a frictionless set of trading.

217
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,110
So in the case where we're selling,

218
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,910
we'd like to maximize the cost.

219
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,410
And we can think of what's sometimes

220
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,720
called the implementation shortfall as being

221
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,690
the difference between a frictionless trade

222
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,850
and the real-world frictions where we're always

223
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,240
going to lose something.

224
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,530
So what do we have?

225
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,730
Well, we've got our frictionless price is quantity

226
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,080
times the initial price.

227
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,380
That's what we'd have if there were no impact at all.

228
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,340
We could implement everything all at once.

229
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,430
And we're going to have subtracted

230
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,190
from that what the actual impact is

231
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,540
of the price changes over the trades that we actually do.

232
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,090
So if we break this into parts, we

233
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,210
have one piece that comes from the diffusivity terms

234
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,430
from all of our trades and we have

235
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,330
another part that comes from the permanent market impact term.

236
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,850
And we're summing this over all periods,

237
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,770
with delta q being the quantity that we

238
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,180
do in each period times the impact time in each period

239
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,820
and the piece that's left over that is non-transient

240
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,130
that affects only the parts that are done within each period.

241
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,280
So this part here, this final term

242
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,030
that's the temporary increase is multiplied by delta q.

243
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,160
It's only the change that we have.

244
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,300
This part here depends on q, the decreasing balance

245
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,920
for the number of shares, even though this term here depends

246
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,127
only on the trading velocity.

247
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:55,710
But we've taken something that-- where

248
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,500
we have initial variables big Q and P0,

249
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,840
initially known price and quantity.

250
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,880
We have unknowns, which are the q's and delta q's.

251
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,170
And we need to determine-- find the optimal policy.

252
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,170
And we've substituted p tilde k, which

253
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,420
is the price we receive in each period.

254
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,540
And we've expressed it in terms of these other variables, some

255
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,440
of which are unknown, including this random variable, z sub

256
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,330
k, others of which are functions of the yet to be determined

257
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,540
policy.

258
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,240
So this is g of delta q and h of delta q.

259
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,140
So this is the expression that we'd like to optimize.

260
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,660
So implementation shortfall we can think about

261
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,520
as something that we measure after we're

262
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,990
done with our program--

263
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,730
that if we're selling a bunch of shares,

264
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,850
our effective final price is less than p0--

265
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,420
and we hope to receive.

266
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,360
So the final price could actually be less

267
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,660
or could be greater due to the randomness of the diffusion.

268
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,010
We're not taking that into account here.

269
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,790
So let's assume that all the trades are executed.

270
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,310
So it's not always the case in markets

271
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,270
that, when you send in a quantity--

272
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,640
when you observe a price, you send in the quantity

273
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,450
that you want.

274
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,937
Depending on whether you do market orders or limit orders,

275
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:12,770
you're necessarily going to get the quantity

276
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,103
you want at the price you thought you were going to get.

277
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:17,840
But let's assume that all the trades are filled regardless

278
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,960
of the price movement.

279
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,200
Let's not consider unfulfilled orders.

280
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,980
And let's note that before we start trading,

281
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,110
the realized effective price is a random variable.

282
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,560
So we're going to need to take expectations,

283
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,750
and we want to optimize the expectations.

284
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,800
So we're going to optimize either the expected cost

285
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,923
or the variance or both or maybe some linear combination.

286
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:41,715
So what do we have?

287
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:44,810
Well, let's look at what the expected cost and variance are.

288
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,720
The expected cost-- I take the expectation of the previous

289
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,515
result. I have the expectation of my random variable

290
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:51,715
in the z's.

291
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:53,090
It's going to drop out because it

292
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,220
was arithmetic Brownian motion and 0 mean,

293
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,760
and we didn't have a drift term.

294
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,070
So the expected cost that we have has these two terms, which

295
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,570
are written in terms of my function

296
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,360
h and j in terms of the permanent and temporary market

297
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,260
impact.

298
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,120
And the algebraic structure is a little bit different.

299
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,020
We're going to massage those so they have a common form.

300
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,360
This has a qk because this depends on the total amount,

301
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,790
and this depends on the incremental amount.

302
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,650
And then if we compute the variance,

303
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,170
the variance does depend on the diffusive term.

304
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,990
This expected cost term is independent of sigma

305
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,410
because the fluctuations were equally likely to help us out

306
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,310
as to hurt us.

307
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,040
But the variance absolutely depends on sigma.

308
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,450
That will only hurt us.

309
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,310
So this depends on sigma squared.

310
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,910
And it's a positive quantity.

311
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,925
It depends on the sum of the q squareds.

312
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:44,520


313
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,180
To look at a concrete example, let's make some assumptions

314
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,820
for the market impact functions.

315
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,490
If we take the permanent impact function

316
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,780
g to be of linear form--

317
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,510
so it's something proportional to the trading speed.

318
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,710
Let's call it gamma times v, where v is the trading speed

319
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,420
delta q over delta t.

320
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,140
We'll find that the final permanent change depends

321
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,760
on the total amount that we have, q.

322
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,360
And what's going on is that when we have this kind of market

323
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,580
impact function, the early trades

324
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,170
are going to push down the price on the later trades.

325
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,210
So it's permanent.

326
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,780
The more we trade early, the more it hurts us later on.

327
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,060
If we trade more slowly at the beginning,

328
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,070
there's less impact on the later trades,

329
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,860
but there will be greater variance.

330
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,030
So we're going to need to find an optimal balance

331
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,220
between those two features.

332
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,470
So there's a bunch of algebra where

333
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,730
the contribution from the expected shortfall that

334
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,630
comes from the permanent impact function--

335
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,100
and with this identity above me, we can simplify some of that.

336
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,980
I can rewrite this sum of the delta q's

337
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,510
by writing it this way.

338
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,020
I can expand it out, expand out this square,

339
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,630
regroup some of the terms, and I can pull out

340
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,480
an overall factor of the-- from-- this is

341
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,850
the sum of squared differences.

342
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,780
I can get the total value of q, quantity

343
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,620
squared, by completing the square minus another term here

344
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,480
that just depends on the differences

345
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,850
and shows up here in the second term,

346
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,860
where I have q times the differences.

347
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,870
And then I can re-express this term

348
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,440
in terms of q, which is a constant and something which

349
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,970
is quadratic in the trading velocity.

350
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,990


351
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,790
What about h?

352
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,820
Well, let's let that be linear as well.

353
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,040
And the choice chosen by Almgren and Chris

354
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,330
is one we can stick with.

355
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,670
Let's let there be something that depends on-- maybe

356
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,240
on the absolute value.

357
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,300
So we'll let it depend on the sign.

358
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,550
We're going to-- not going to assume that we ever

359
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,380
get helped out by trades.

360
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,050
So there's never any positive benefit to trading.

361
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,870
If you're a market maker and you are providing liquidity

362
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,820
to the markets, then you can make money on your trades.

363
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,640
We're going to assume that that's not the case here.

364
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,650
So remember that h is going to be multiplied times the trade

365
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,040
that we do in a given size.

366
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,010
So that's why the constant term--

367
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,900
we want to make sure it's going to have the appropriate sign.

368
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,490
So it's-- we are going to lose money regardless of whether

369
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,968
we're buying or selling.

370
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:16,760
That's why we have the sign function there.

371
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,968
And the other term is linear.

372
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:19,910
And it's going to multiply a delta q.

373
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,710
So we have that down here, when we

374
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,770
substitute in that linear expression in the top.

375
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,330
This is just an assumption.

376
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,060
Eta and c1 are constant coefficients.

377
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,490
And when we substitute that general form,

378
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,570
we're going to get something in expression,

379
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,840
which is the contribution to the expected cost--

380
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,880
is something that depends on the absolute value

381
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,440
of the number of shares that we trade

382
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,220
and something that's quadratic.

383
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,660
So if we combine those terms from the h and the g,

384
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,550
from the temporary and the permanent,

385
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,430
we find that our expected cost is

386
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,340
going to have term that's going to be constant

387
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,000
plus a term that's linear with an absolute value

388
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,890
plus a term that's quadratic.

389
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,140
If all the terms have the same sign,

390
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,270
then we can drop the absolute value.

391
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,430
That's assuming, as in the little grid example

392
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,819
we had, that we're not changing directions--

393
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,460
that if we want to sell shares, our strategy is not to buy some

394
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,290
back and then resell them.

395
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,579
That might be possible.

396
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,618
You could imagine a scenario with asymmetric market impact

397
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:19,410
where, if you go in the opposite direction,

398
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,530
you fake out the market, induce a price change that's

399
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,530
in your favor, and then you turn around on the other side.

400
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,450
We're going to assume that the markets don't respond that way

401
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,990
and you are not trying to manipulate them in such a way.

402
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,270
So we'll remove the absolute value.

403
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,790
And then we'll have a term which is--

404
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,320
which now simplifies.

405
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,830
If all of the delta q's have the same value,

406
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,220
then we can sum them up.

407
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,520
We get big Q. So we have a constant term in front.

408
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,650
We've got some parameter here whose sign

409
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,470
is going to depend on the chosen parameters in the problem.

410
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,210
And we've got something which is quadratic in delta q.
