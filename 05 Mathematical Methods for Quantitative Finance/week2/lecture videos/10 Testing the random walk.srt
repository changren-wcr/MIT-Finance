PROFESSOR: The random walk model, like many models,

1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,460
can and should be tested when it's applied against real world

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:07,960
data.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,030
So let's do that.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,240
The random walk model has a long history in finance.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,690
It actually began back over a century in 1900

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,720
with Bachelier, whose mathematics thesis

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,680
studied the movements of stock prices on the Paris Bourse.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,590
It was not much appreciated by his dissertation committee.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,400
And the work was forgotten for a long time.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,700
And we'll talk in more modern terms.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,200
By the 1960s, random walks had reappeared in finance,

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,870
had been rediscovered, including Bachelier's work.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:47,110
And the idea was that not only might random

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,390
walks provide a good model for the way stock prices seem

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,480
to behave in the market.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,530
It would explain why there's so much randomness and noise

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,380
and why not everybody can get rich trading stocks.

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,070
But at a deeper level, it might be

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,540
a key to understanding how markets should behave

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,270
and how markets serve not only as

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,790
places where value is exchanged but where

22
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,770
information is exchanged.

23
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,940
And the idea is very simple.

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,290
The idea is that if people had access to information

25
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,380
in the markets, then if everyone knew

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,940
what something should be worth, then

27
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,357
the price should be at that value.

28
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:28,732
If you knew that something was going to be worth twice as

29
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:31,150
much tomorrow, why would you sell it today for anything

30
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,150
less?

31
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,110
So in a-- if we take that one step further,

32
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,790
we have this notion that if markets

33
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,630
were efficient in the sense that investors are taking

34
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,700
into account the available information,

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,190
then the only reason prices should change

36
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,380
is the arrival of new information

37
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,780
that hadn't been anticipated.

38
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,820
That's sort of the definition of news.

39
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,880
And in such a world, prices would behave randomly.

40
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,380
So somewhat paradoxically, randomness of prices

41
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,860
would be a sign of markets operating efficiently.

42
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,550
That is, a good market, a well functioning market,

43
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,120
is one where things look chaotic.

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,200
So this was promoted by a number of celebrated economists,

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,670
including these papers that I am showing you here.

46
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,880
One by Eugene Fama, who said specifically

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,640
that we can model stock prices as random walks.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,260
And Paul Samuelson, who looked at exactly how and why it

49
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,390
was that this paradox might work mathematically.

50
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,400
And he has one of the most wonderful titles

51
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,540
in the paper, the Proof that Properly Anticipated Prices

52
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,960
Fluctuate Randomly, which captures this paradox.

53
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,603
But we're not interested just in the theoretical side.

54
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,020
We want to see the empirical side.

55
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,460
So what I'd like to do is show you how this can be tested.

56
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,570
And we'll follow another set of economists

57
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,780
who did celebrated work a couple of decades after this.

58
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,660
And you have the advantage of coming to this a couple decades

59
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,680
after them.

60
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,770
And you can check data now and see if they were right.

61
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,240
And who you agree with.

62
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,970
So what I'd like to do is review these results,

63
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,070
show you the computational approach,

64
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,290
give you some of the computational tools,

65
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,400
and then let you loose on the data.

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,050
OK?

67
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,210
So this is a great starting point

68
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,230
for doing empirical analysis and for seeing

69
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,790
how we might test different ideas

70
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,570
over different periods of time.

71
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,240
So the basic questions, though, that

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,793
motivate this are this question as to how stock prices--

73
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:36,460
I'll talk about stocks for concreteness.

74
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,700
But this could apply to any asset that

75
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,800
is investable and its tradable.

76
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,240
We do want to think about this primarily as being something

77
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,650
that we're going to apply to either exchange traded

78
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,810
instruments or things in a very active public market.

79
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,510
So that the data is observable.

80
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,180
It is essential that people be able to observe the data

81
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,200
and what goes on.

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,730
And possibly for different versions

83
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,380
of the efficient markets hypothesis

84
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,340
have access to other amounts of information.

85
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,310
But our examples will be with stocks

86
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,670
and the generalizations that are most easily

87
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,740
accessible with these computational tools

88
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,590
are those that come from published

89
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,130
prices on exchange traded assets of different kinds.

90
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,990
So we want to ask two things.

91
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,070
One of them is that we have the question about how

92
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,360
stock prices do behave.

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,930
That's an empirical question.

94
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,310
And then behind that is how stock prices should behave.

95
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,070
And as a background idea, let's think

96
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,600
of this idea of Fama and Samuelson and back to Bachelier

97
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,450
that possibly our null hypothesis should

98
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,920
be that stocks behave randomly.

99
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,520
Which sounds kind of crazy and radical when you first hear

100
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,740
it, but let's assume that that's the case,

101
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,800
let's follow this logic.

102
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,330
That it's the sign of a well functioning market.

103
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,080
And let's see how the behavior actually works.

104
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,617
So many people, depending on your background,

105
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:01,450
you might come to this with different ideas.

106
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,420
You might think that asset prices should be deterministic.

107
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,647
That's certainly true if you buy a bond

108
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:10,230
or you put money in a savings account.

109
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,980
You know how much money you should get out

110
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,830
if the bond is risk free and guaranteed.

111
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,460
And we've seen that in other financial instruments

112
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,700
and financial settings.

113
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,250
But when it comes to things like stocks,

114
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,660
there's a lot of uncertainty.

115
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,660
So it could be that there are general trends

116
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,550
that we could now and discern but there's some noise.

117
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,570
So maybe it's deterministic but for a little bit of noise.

118
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,210
Or maybe things are fundamentally random

119
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,590
and there's nothing deterministic at all.

120
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,480
So behind this, these are the questions again motivating it.

121
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,610
Are markets efficient?

122
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,810
And for many financial applications, really what this

123
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,500
comes down to is if they're not efficient in the economist

124
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,150
sense, we can ask a very practical question

125
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,190
that every investor has in mind.

126
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,930
Are asset prices predictable?

127
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,810
So the random walk model would say

128
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,260
that they're not except in a certain kind of trivial way.

129
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,200
And deviations from the random walk,

130
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,990
if we were to reject a random walk model, that

131
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,970
opens the door to the question to some of these questions like

132
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,860
are asset prices predictable?

133
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,960
What might be alternative models that we have?

134
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,390
So let's take a look at the data.

135
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,000
