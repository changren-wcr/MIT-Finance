00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
PROFESSOR: Let's take a look at the random walk model, which

1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,770
is going to be our first and most basic example

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,050
of a stochastic process, and it's

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,150
building block for many more complex models

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,060
and finance, as many applications in other fields

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,270
as well.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,610
So the first notion that we want to examine

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,490
is that of a stochastic process.

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,820
So a stochastic process is a time dependent random variable.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,050
So we saw random variables x, y, z before,

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,770
and they occurred individually, we could add them up.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,930
But now imagine, that we have one that's labeled by times.

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,240
So for each time we get a different value.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,190
Now there are two important different cases.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,050
One of them is where time evolves continuously,

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,690
and our variable S of t can be thought

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,800
of as a function of a continuous real variable t.

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,790
The other case, is where t evolves discretely.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,200
And we have a sequence of points S 1, S 2, S 3 and so on,

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,140
that are separated in time.

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,900
When these are taken at uniform intervals,

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,210
we use these as the basis for a time series model.

22
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,240
After all, when we talk about time series data,

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,380
we think about a sequence of observations, usually labeled

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,820
by an integer, and sequential in time.

25
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,220
And typically, considered a uniform intervals, or at least

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,540
we like to think of them as uniform intervals.

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,500
So the continuous time is more complex

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,145
and uses different mathematical tools.

29
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:28,770
So we're going to deal with that later.

30
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,050
Within the discrete case, what are some

31
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,960
of the attributes and properties that we'd like to be aware of?

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,770
Well, we're going to label these with integer indices,

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,530
and there are cases where something might

34
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,840
be a finite or infinite length.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,020
But we'll typically pick an origin, we'll call time 0,

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,120
and then we'll go forward from there.

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,580
We think about these being equally spaced,

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,810
but all that's required is that, the applications

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,520
view them as equally spaced.

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,230
An example from finance, in the equity markets,

41
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,680
is its conventional to look only at market day.

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,290
So we exclude weekends and holidays, and number

43
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,680
of the days sequentially.

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,630
That doesn't apply, for example, for earning of interest

45
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,940
that happens on a calendar day basis.

46
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,610
But we might still label points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

47
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,130
10 to cover a two week period, even though the period is

48
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,000
14 days and the gap is longer over the weekends.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,440
The choice of origin is going to depend on our convention and/or

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,550
applications.

51
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,420
We'll see interestingly, you might

52
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,560
want to keep an eye on this, usually it's not a big deal

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,510
and it's usually obvious where to begin.

54
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,170
But some of the mathematical properties strictly speaking,

55
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,640
such as stationarity, require series to be infinitely long.

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,520
And, of course, that's not true in financial applications.

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,590
Markets haven't been around infinitely long,

58
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,600
and we usually don't want to go back

59
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,970
to the beginning of time in any event.

60
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,630
Moreover, when we look at how to simulate

61
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,655
some of these processes, put them on a computer,

62
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:01,530
we're not going to be able to deal too easily

63
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,480
with infinite processes either.

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,680
So although the choice of an origin

65
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,190
is different from whether the integers run

66
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,970
from minus infinity to infinity or from 0 to infinity,

67
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,560
there are distinctions in the mathematics,

68
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,720
for a financial applications they shouldn't matter.

69
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,250
But it's something that we ought to check, as we go.

70
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,020
Now discrete time processes.

71
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,770
So we're to be talking about our often constructed

72
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,310
by taking an existing value and adding a new increment.

73
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,940
And this gives us a recursive definition, a building block,

74
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,470
a building method for a series.

75
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,300
So we start with a particular value,

76
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,170
we add a new increment x, that gives us our next value,

77
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,680
we add 1 and so on.

78
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,810
So we can also--

79
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,030
we can either think of a recursive definition.

80
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,360
Or we can just think of the value at a given point,

81
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,720
as the sum of all the increments that have come to that point.

82
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,230
Now of course, if we have the sequence S 1, S 2, S 3, S 4,

83
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,885
we can recover the increments by differencing successive ones.

84
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:06,510
And we'll see that that's very natural,

85
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,210
when we look at asset prices.

86
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,390
That the difference between price observations

87
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,570
or their logarithms, will be related to the returns

88
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,830
over a given period.

89
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,610


90
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:24,200
Time series are used for modeling processes that evolve

91
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,520
or that are observed discreetly in time.

92
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,550
So what we care about is that there

93
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,160
are discrete observations, discrete moments where

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,450
we might observe, measure, or draw

95
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,400
a value of a random variable.

96
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,020
It could be, that there's something

97
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,000
that's happening continuously, and we just

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,830
observe it periodically.

99
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,190
Or it could be a process that's genuinely discrete.

100
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,890
Also the values themselves can be

101
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,750
either continuous or discrete.

102
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,840
But the characteristic of a time series,

103
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
is that there are discrete values.

104
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,570
Now because of that, we often do describe them

105
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,990
in recursively, where we think about what the previous value

106
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,940
is and there's some innovation.

107
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,560
And this gives us--

108
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,420
when we think about this constructively,

109
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,920
notion about how things do evolve

110
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,530
in time and about how information arrives.

111
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,600
So we're always building on the past,

112
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,590
we're never drawing information from the future.

113
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,520
What does it mean to solve such a model?

114
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,180
Well, what we'll see is that, will

115
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,990
be interested in the entire sequence of random variables.

116
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,100
and it's often more natural to think of the entire trajectory,

117
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,540
the entire path.

118
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,670
But at a minimum, what we want to ask

119
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,340
are some description, some attributes,

120
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,270
some properties of the distribution of not yet

121
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,320
observed values, and possibly to construct

122
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,050
probabilistic forecasts for what they might be.

123
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,830
Some examples of things that could

124
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,590
be modeled via time series that evolve in time that

125
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,570
have this cumulative nature, we might

126
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,630
be looking inside a corporation and its cumulative revenues,

127
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,280
or its income or its profit.

128
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,220
And we might take its values, such as I 1, plus I 2 plus I 3,

129
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,440
say quater 1, quater 2, quater 3.

130
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,418
And adding up to the cumulative revenue for a firm,

131
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:15,710
we might be interested in the evolution of stock prices

132
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,050
and more of a lot more to say about this later on.

133
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,960
If we think of little r as representing

134
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,000
the logarithmic return of a stock price,

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,210
then we can see that actually, we

136
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,680
could write the value of the stock

137
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,890
price at time t as an initial value

138
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,170
plus the cumulative effect of returns

139
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,035
during period 1, period 2, period 3, period 4.

140
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:38,720
We'll be coming back to this very quickly.

141
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,500
And the simplest model of all, is the random walk model.

142
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,000
