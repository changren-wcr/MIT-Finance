1
00:00:00,742 --> 00:00:02,950
PROFESSOR: Let's generalize the random walk model now

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,920
by adding two parameters.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,780
So what we'll do is we will take our basic standardized random

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,900
variable, z, and we're going to multiply it times 1

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,700
constant called sigma.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,440
And that's a scale factor.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,360
And then, we're going to add another constant, mu.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,650
So it's very simple-- just a linear generalization

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,820
of our previous z.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,600
So we'll call this linear combination sigma z plus mu.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,660
We'll give it a new name.

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,930
We'll call it r.

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,930
We still have the property that the steps

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,820
are independent in each time period.

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,350
That follows from the independence of the z's.

16
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,460
So the z's are our same old friends the z's we had before.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,040
And the new random variable, not surprisingly,

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,430
is going to have a different mean and variance.

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,720
The two parameters that we have, sigma and mu,

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,930
are going to be interpreted in financial applications

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,710
as parameters that describe risk and return, which are the two

22
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,100
basic elements we need of course, for understanding

23
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,530
investments, for understanding financial markets.

24
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,780
And this is the simplest non-trivial model

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,500
that we've got.

26
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,040
So let's see where that takes us.

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,340
If we want to match this on-- just to give you a heads up

28
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,820
for where we're going--

29
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,300
consider stock prices.

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,070
Observe regularly, say daily--

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,350
P1, P2, P3 are different stock prices.

32
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,030
And we can think of the return from one period to the next

33
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,493
as being possibly modeled by a random variable.

34
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:30,910
We don't know in the future what's

35
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,830
going to happen from one day to the next.

36
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,590
We can ask what's the distribution from which

37
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,370
these variables are drawn.

38
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,840
And if they are drawn from an IID distribution,

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,600
if they're independent and identically distributed,

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,990
what would be the consequences of compounding these returns

41
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,000
over a long period of time?

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,910
The identification we typically make

43
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,560
is to identify r sub t, which I've denoted with a little r,

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,470
to be the logarithm of the price ratio.

45
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,380
And this is close to the simple return numerically.

46
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,630
But we'll see that this is a better

47
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,060
model both empirically and theoretically.

48
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,240
We can go backwards from these returns

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,420
to the prices in the same way that we mentioned before,

50
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,920
that we can add and iterate the process if we

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,800
have a recursive idea of what the returns are

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,360
and the prices are.

53
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,340
And we can build up the price series

54
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,940
by looking at a compounded sum of returns.

55
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,410
Because we've taken the logarithm

56
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,140
to get the little bars, we exponentiate to get the prices.

57
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,220
So this is how we can think about where

58
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,180
these r's in this generalized random model,

59
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:47,850
these r's are going to fit in to a model for asset prices.

60
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,390
Now, since the expectational operator is linear,

61
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,570
we're going to generalize our previous results.

62
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,310
It will be almost as easy as what we did before.

63
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:04,020
So we have that the return is just a constant time z plus mu.

64
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,360
We know that the expectation of a constant,

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,890
and we know the expectation of a sum

66
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,700
is the sum of the expectations.

67
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,120
So the expectation of the sum is mu plus sigma times

68
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,980
the expectation of z.

69
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,440
And we remember that the expectation of z is 0.

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,000
So very simply, the expected return of r sub t is mu.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,380
What about the variance?

72
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,030
The variance is defined as the expectation of the square

73
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,980
of the variable minus its mean.

74
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,290
We just computed the mean on the line above.

75
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,830
And r minus mu is sigma z.

76
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,360
We take that squared.

77
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,480
The constant, sigma squared, comes out of the expectation.

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,150
The expectation of z squared is 1.

79
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,310
So we're left with the variance of r is sigma squared.

80
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,670
And then our last relationship among the z's translates here

81
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,310
as well.

82
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,660
And this gives us the covariance of two

83
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,820
r's taken at different periods of time.

84
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,810
The definition of the covariance is the expectation

85
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,030
of the product of two random variables,

86
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,040
relative to their means.

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,700
Because rt and our rt prime have an arbitrary time index,

88
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,130
they have the same mean.

89
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,529
And this is just the same thing as the expectation value.

90
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,110
It's proportional to the expectation

91
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,620
value of the zt equals zt prime at two different times.

92
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,900
And that's equal to 0, as we've seen before.

93
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,292
Now, here's where it gets interesting.

94
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's take a look at what happens when we

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,540
add a bunch of them together.

96
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,100
So let's look at defining a new thing I'll call X big T

97
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,080
to be r1 plus r2 plus r3.

98
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,960
And what we're interested in is the dependence on time.

99
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,810
So the r's are independent of each other.

100
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,400
But we'd like to know how the distribution of X

101
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,790
depends on the moments of the individual r's,

102
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,490
and in particular how it depends on how many of them

103
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,130
we have-- that is what's the time dependence.

104
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,520
So once again, we use linearity.

105
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,030
We take expectations of both sides of this equation,

106
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,370
and we expand out.

107
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,870
What do we find?

108
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,380
First, for the mean, the expectation of XT

109
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,170
is the expectation of r1 plus expectation of r2 and so on.

110
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,200
Each of these expectations is identical.

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,520
This is mu plus mu plus mu, T times.

112
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,040
And that gives us T times mu.

113
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,750
So remember that our standardized,

114
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,230
our pure random walk standardized, just

115
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,180
the sum of the z's had been 0.

116
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,130
Now we have a slightly different result,

117
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:38,660
because each of the r's has a non-zero mean.

118
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,690
The result is T times the individual mean.

119
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,400
How about the variance?

120
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,490
The variance is only slightly more complicated.

121
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,520
We just need to do a little bit of algebra.

122
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,310
The variance, as always, is defined

123
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,650
as the expectation of the square of the variable minus its mean.

124
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,850
We just computed the mean.

125
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,420
It was T times mu.

126
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,300
Now, here's a convenient trick.

127
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,440
Let's write it out.

128
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,790
Let's write T mu is mu plus mu plus mu plus mu.

129
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,350
And let's expand out X. So that we

130
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,590
can group this together in these suggestive and interesting

131
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,120
groupings, as the expectation of r1 minus mu plus r2

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,850
minus mu, plus, and so on up to rT minus mu.

133
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,400
So each of these things--

134
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,680
r minus mu as a unit, is the random component

135
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,010
of our process.

136
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,270
We can think of mu as being a deterministic piece.

137
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,970
It's the amount that gets added in every single period.

138
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,790
And we're also getting a random component.

139
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,890
That's our sigma zT term.

140
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,400
So these are the sum of these random variables.

141
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,760
Since each of these r minus mus is a sigma z1, sigma z2, and so

142
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,450
on, we have a sigma squared that pulls out of the expectation,

143
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,580
because it's a constant multiplier.

144
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,190
And then, we got to use our previous result--

145
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,520
that we have the expectation of the sum of z's quantity squared

146
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,220
is just T. So, now we have this scale factor of sigma squared.

147
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,150
And that's our basic result for this generalized random walk.

148
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,500
So to summarize-- the generalized random walk model

149
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,620
is constructed as a sum of IID random variables,

150
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,870
r1 plus r2 plus r3.

151
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,440
Each of these generalizes our standard z

152
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,230
by multiplying it times 1 constant, sigma,

153
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,060
and adding another mu.

154
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,020
We can think of these as being related to volatility,

155
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,960
the risk associated with an investment,

156
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,170
and mu, the constant deterministic return

157
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,680
that we would have if we turn volatility off.

158
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,660
The mean and the variance are linear in time.

159
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,970
So as before, we apply linearity and compute expectations.

160
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,300
Notice that we're not computing here, the full distribution

161
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,990
of x.

162
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,020
And we haven't used the full distribution of the individual

163
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,620
r's.

164
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,600
We've just used the mean and variance

165
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,010
of r's to get the mean and variance and covariances,

166
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,580
and those properties for x and T.

167
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,350
Our basic result that's going to be

168
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,050
important for financial applications

169
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,450
and for our intuition about randomness

170
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,420
and financial markets, is that the mean

171
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,440
is proportional to time.

172
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,940
And the variance is proportional to time,

173
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,990
which means it's square root, which we associate

174
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,860
with the volatility grows as square root of T.

175
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,509
That is the volatility, the standard deviation of x sub T,

176
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:38,409
is sigma times the square root of T.

177
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,539
