00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:02,380
PROFESSOR: Monte Carlo simulation

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,470
means we use computers instead of our pen and paper,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,940
to work out consequences of probability models

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,790
and stochastic processes.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,670
What we do is, we simulate stochastic processes

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,670
by drawing random numbers using the random number

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,200
generator on a computer.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,870
And this can be found in most programming languages.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,170
This provides us with really an idealized test

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,465
lab for exploring some of the ideas

11
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:30,340
we've talked about and for much more advanced

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,990
financial applications.

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,210
The reason is, that because we're

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,280
doing the simulation ourselves, because we're

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,530
deploying the random number generator that we're

16
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,420
parameterized, that we're coding,

17
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,100
we know where the data comes from.

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,040
In the real world we don't know the true data generating

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,690
process, that's part of the subtlety and art in model

20
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,450
building as we try to infer that, that's

21
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,980
what we're trying to solve.

22
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,652
In the Monte Carlo lab, we assume that that's known,

23
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:58,360
and we'll see it still gives us our hands

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,060
full of a lot of things that we need to check out.

25
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,943
But if we can't understand and do the analysis with data

26
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:07,360
that we've generated ourselves, we

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,920
have no hope for doing it in the real world.

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,140
On the other hand, doing things thoroughly in a test lab,

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,130
gives us great idea about the abilities and limits of some

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,640
of our analytical tools.

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,100
So we'll find out how much accuracy and precision,

32
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,400
we can have in different kinds of simulation settings.

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,330
So the idea is, that we're going to assume a particular model,

34
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,810
we're going to assume that we know the way the world works,

35
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,120
and we're going to generate data that is consistent with that.

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,750
So those properties will all be true self-consistently

37
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,760
because we built the model that way.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,908
We can then for some purposes, forget

39
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:43,450
that we knew where the data came from

40
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,300
and analyze it as if it were real world data.

41
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,700
But typically, one of the applications that we'll do,

42
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,910
is we'll generate a large number of possible outcomes.

43
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,790
So think of doing a simulation for the evolution of a stock

44
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,120
price, or an entire stock market, or some other asset

45
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,930
price.

46
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,150
In the real world we only get to see history once,

47
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,300
and when we look at actual historical data,

48
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,460
we only have one history.

49
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,620
We can't redo the experiment.

50
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,120
We might be able to get more data,

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,620
by looking at different time periods

52
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,690
or going further back in time.

53
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,180
But that's not the same thing, as repeating everything

54
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,960
under the same conditions.

55
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,620
So here will be limited only by our computers

56
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,590
abilities and the time we're willing to commit to it.

57
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,100
But the usual process, involves taking a large number

58
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,190
say, 10,000 or a million different simulations.

59
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,370
And constructing what we'll call an ensemble

60
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,240
a set of possible hypothetical paths that might have

61
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,020
happened, each of which typically being equally likely.

62
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,650
And then, instead of what we've done so far,

63
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,590
where we've computed properties of a distribution.

64
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,980
Like moments in the distribution, mean,

65
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,270
and variance by doing mathematical expectations

66
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,490
against a known probability density,

67
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,910
here we're going to do statistical calculations

68
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,330
against the empirical data set that's been generated

69
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,100
through our Monte Carlo data.

70
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,830
And what we'll see is, that the results typically

71
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,490
become more precise as we look at more and more data, which

72
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,920
is only limited again by our computational resources.

73
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,690
So I'll show you some examples, and I'll you

74
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,815
should run them yourselves.

75
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:26,260
So I'm providing some code here, and you

76
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,850
can take a look at in the R programming language.

77
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,970
And you can play around with all the parameters.

78
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,595
And you can take a look at what happens

79
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:35,590
as we increase the number of simulations,

80
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,240
or as we change some of the parameters.

81
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,430
So it's a great chance to try some things out

82
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,680
in a different setting apart from the pencil and paper

83
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,870
things that we've done before.

84
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,520
To build applications that we have

85
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,500
are going to include asset price dynamics

86
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
that we'll look at now.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,010
Option pricing, which we'll look at a little bit later on.

88
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,520
And many applications in portfolio and risk management.
