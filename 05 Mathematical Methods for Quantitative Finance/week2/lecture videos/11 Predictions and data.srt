00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
PROFESSOR: The random walk model that we've seen thus far

1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,480
is a two-parameter model, as this

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,860
is our generalized random walk.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,590
We have two parameters, mu and sigma, which are constant.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,860
And that tells us how the returns get generated

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,370
in subsequent periods.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,520
So one of the things about this model

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,800
is if we're to look at data and try to match returns

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,170
to this model, obviously, that means

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,440
that if mu and sigma really are the constants

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,170
and this really is the model, then it means that if we

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,030
observe, measure, and estimate the parameters, mu and sigma,

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,680
they should be the same in any time period we look at,

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,700
to within sampling error and statistical estimates.

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,060
So one way you could think of testing the model

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,840
is we could say, well, this is the model.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,390
Let's do mu and sigma.

17
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,890
Can we estimate them?

18
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,120
Do we get constants?

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,380
Then we're done.

20
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,300
Well, that's a little bit too specific.

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,360
And it doesn't generalize quite as nicely.

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,860
So what we're going to do is we want

23
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,180
to look at quantifying how big the variations are, so we can

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,110
get an idea as to how significant departures might be

25
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,740
if there are any, and to give us some insight as to what

26
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,330
other directions might be available

27
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,440
and what might be driving the results.

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,440
So what we're going to do is we're

29
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,700
going to look at some properties of the random walk--

30
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,610
in particular, the way that the variance scales,

31
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,250
with time, which we've already seen for the pure random walk

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,120
model.

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,070
And we're going to apply that to data

34
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,000
by looking at aggregating data over different observation

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,230
frequencies.

36
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,160
And let's do that concretely with particular stock.

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,650
And the stock that I like to use for this example

38
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,240
is Tootsie Roll.

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,295
The Tootsie Roll company makes wonderful candies

40
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:42,670
that will stick to your teeth, and make your dentist very

41
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,110
happy, probably over time.

42
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,640
And you'll enjoy eating them.

43
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,240
But a couple of reasons why I picked Tootsie Roll-- but you

44
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,400
can and should pick your own company to do the same thing.

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,540
First of all, the company is founded in 1896,

46
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,050
and has one of the longest track records

47
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,120
for any publicly-traded company.

48
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,630
So most companies, even the most venerable ones eventually

49
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,169
end up either going out of business,

50
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,660
acquiring or being acquired by somebody else.

51
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,540
And it's unusual to find extremely long time series.

52
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,190
There are only handful of companies

53
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,040
that go back to the beginning of the 20th century.

54
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,560
And data providers usually don't go back before 1926.

55
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,590
But Tootsie Roll is one of them, so that's one good reason.

56
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,770
It also recently found popularity

57
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,610
with the wallstreetbets crowd on Reddit.

58
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,380
So if you want to look at some real challenges

59
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,380
to the random walk model, you should take a look

60
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,490
at the data from 2020.

61
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,590
So we're going to cut off a bit before that.

62
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,350
Because certainly, the madness of crowds

63
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,115
is a subject for a whole other course

64
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:44,240
that we can take a look at.

65
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,670
But if you want to test the null hypothesis,

66
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,750
I'll leave that data out of sample.

67
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,910
And you can try it out on more recent data.

68
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,810
And finally, one of the reasons I like Tootsie Roll is they

69
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,580
ran a famous add back in my childhood ages

70
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,970
ago, with an owl and animals in the forest.

71
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,330
But the owl was the wise one who was

72
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,670
able to answer the question-- how many licks

73
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,300
does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.

74
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,820
And you should go look at that video on YouTube

75
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,880
or on Tootsie Roll's corporate website if you can find it.

76
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,250
It's a great example of empirical science at work.

77
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,707
So the approach we're going to take, as I mentioned before,

78
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,040
is falling to other economists--

79
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,120
Andrew Lo and Craig MacKinlay, who tested the random

80
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,620
walk model on a variety of data in the late 1980s.

81
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,720
And their approach was to look at some general properties

82
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,730
that we would expect to find if the random walk model held,

83
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,910
scaling behavior and by looking at the variance.

84
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,340
And they were able to analyze data

85
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,400
and came up with some really interesting results.

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,820
So I want to show you what they did.

87
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,070
Give you some code to show you how you can do it yourself--

88
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,360
and we'll take a look at the results for one example,

89
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,630
for the case of Tootsie Roll stock.

90
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,240
Lo and MacKinlay applied this for individual stocks.

91
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,550
They looked across stock indices.

92
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,040
They looked at equal weighted, market cap weighted indices.

93
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,110
And I strongly recommend taking a look at their original paper,

94
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,930
after or before or alongside going through this.

95
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,330
So what were the elements?

96
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,940
They were looking at what's called a variance ratio

97
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,480
test, that we'll define in a moment, which

98
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,960
lets us get at the behavior of a random walk

99
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,910
in the following way-- we have a problem

100
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,220
if we were to apply the data.

101
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,590
The version that we saw, where we

102
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,840
saw that the variance of a random walk

103
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,950
grew linearly with time, is great.

104
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,142
If you look at longer and longer time periods.

105
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:47,350
But if we think about doing that with financial data,

106
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,350
we immediately see that there's a problem, which

107
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,870
is something might have changed in the market.

108
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,530
It's not the same data if this were

109
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,080
generated from a random number generator and a Monte Carlo.

110
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,030
Sure that would work.

111
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,520
But we have a lot of different potential things

112
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,480
that might come into play if we look at 1896 to 2000.

113
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,570
And then the next 20 years and the next 50 years and so on,

114
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,920
a lot of economic things change.

115
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,770
And perhaps we don't need to assume

116
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,260
that over the entire period that everything was random.

117
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,460
There might be over some period.

118
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,030
So the idea that Lo and MacKinlay applied

119
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,410
was to look at the variance over random walks

120
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,920
of different lengths taken not by extending the time period,

121
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,260
but by increasing the observation frequency.

122
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,620
That is they subdivided into smaller and smaller chunks

123
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,030
so they could look at one month returns, one week returns, one

124
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,300
day returns, and so on.

125
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,750
In the case of Lo and MacKinlay, they did weeks.

126
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,640
Conversely, we could aggregate up.

127
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,730
So we could think of a base observation frequency.

128
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,130
I'll use daily frequencies.

129
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,720
Lo and MacKinlay used weekly.

130
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,850
And we could say what happens if I compute

131
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,570
using one day, if I compute using two days, four days,

132
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,430
15-day periods, and so on.

133
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,060
And in each case, if the observation period

134
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,070
gets longer and is more coarse grained,

135
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,350
that there will be fewer returns in the sum.

136
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,090
So that will give us some behavior,

137
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,310
and let's just do the arithmetic and we'll see.

138
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,120
And then we'll compare it with the data.

139
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,570
So what we'll do is we'll construct a test that nicely

140
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,090
eliminates a lot of things that we don't really

141
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,640
want to worry about from real world market and the data.

142
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,240
And then we'll compare and see what the consequences are.

143
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,100
So let's first look at some of the data.

144
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,450
So I've gotten this data from Yahoo Finance.

145
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:43,000
in R using the tidyquant package and the tq_get() function.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,560
You can pull this data in, or you

147
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,050
can download it and do the same thing in Excel if you want.

148
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,980
But let's take a look.

149
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,090
Here's an example of recent period

150
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,610
of prices for Tootsie Roll stock, ending through 2017.

151
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,850
As I mentioned, we're leaving out the Reddit period.

152
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,320
If I compute the log returns from the successive price

153
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,360
differences on a daily level and I plot their time series,

154
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,880
I get this graph of differences, differences

155
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,600
of the logs over here.

156
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,000
And what we can see is a few interesting features--

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,470
and this is typical of all sorts of stock returns.

158
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,700
You should try this out.

159
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,250
First of all, it's noisy.

160
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,720
There are a lot of ups and downs.

161
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,690
Although the first graph on the left looks like Tootsie Roll

162
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,180
had a very successful period in this.

163
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,190
And the stock price rose a lot.

164
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,260
If we look at it day-by-day level, what we see

165
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,140
is lots of noise.

166
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,050
There lots of ups and downs.

167
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,020
If we even try to look at what the mean is,

168
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,060
if we try to eyeball and draw a line through it,

169
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,210
the line you see through it is the origin .

170
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,270
It's hard to say that the mean is

171
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,680
significantly different from 0.

172
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,020
And that's typically true on a one-day level

173
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,400
at high frequencies, financial data,

174
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,950
it's very difficult to discern what

175
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,940
the mean return is that will aggregate over

176
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,380
a long period of time.

177
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,110
But then we also notice that there are these spikes.

178
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,450
This is really not uniform volatility.

179
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,940
It doesn't look like uniform randomness.

180
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,000
And to compare that, look behind me at this graph here.

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,800
This shows a simulated white noise process.

182
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,480
White noise just means that we're

183
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,010
drawing from a random, normal distribution

184
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,788
with constant volatility.

185
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:28,330
And you can see that there's a pretty clear envelope function

186
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,740
here that's at around say, the equivalent of plus or minus

187
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,330
say, three standard deviation.

188
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,840
So I've normalized this graph on the right

189
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,280
to have the volatility equal to the empirical volatility

190
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,270
of Tootsie Roll.

191
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,480
So just kind of intuitively looking at the two,

192
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,430
does Tootsie Roll look like the random walk?

193
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,300
Those graphs look kind of different.

194
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,350
But obviously, that's not enough to make a definitive statement,

195
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,770
much less to tell us if a random walk isn't good,

196
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,350
what might be a better model for Tootsie Roll.

197
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,910
We can look at summary statistics.

198
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,250
And I've got a bunch of them here in R,

199
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,300
including ranges for the values over time.

200
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,790
And we can take a look at the distribution

201
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,090
for the statistics.

202
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,880
So we've got numbers overall.

203
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,460
For example, over time, the mean annualized return is 8 and 1/2%

204
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,340
with the volatility of 24%--

205
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,950
kind of typical numbers for a stock.

206
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,650
The histogram, we can take a look at--

207
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,800
how does it look to you?

208
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,770
So we've go, it's a single peak.

209
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,500
It's humped.

210
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,480
See if we can get that back, I'm sorry.

211
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,090
So it has a single peak.

212
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,750
It's humped in the middle.

213
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,480
Notice it looks kind of narrow and peaky, not nice

214
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,610
and rounded like a typical Gaussian distribution.

215
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,310
It has fat tails, which don't show up here

216
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,470
because the tails are really small.

217
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,500
But you might have heard of fat tail distribution.

218
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,400
A corollary of distributions, since the probability has

219
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,740
to sum to 1, is that if they've got fat tails,

220
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,660
then they also have to have thin middles.

221
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,610
There's less probability in the middle

222
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,050
than you would otherwise.

223
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,990
Notice that it is roughly symmetric.

224
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,190
That is upside and downside returns are about the same.

225
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,748
And we look at returns, not prices.

226
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,790
Why do you think that is?

227
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,580


228
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,640
You can try it, and take a look at the price distribution.

229
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,020
The reason that we expect that the return distribution,

230
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,190
from an investment perspective, is likely to be stationary.

231
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,610
That is the price levels are not, or shouldn't

232
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,470
be important to investors.

233
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,290
What matters is the return that you have.

234
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,510
So if the initial price is $10 or $100 or $1,000,

235
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,590
it shouldn't matter.

236
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,530
The price levels will depend on the actual history

237
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,080
of the stock, and where it started out and where it went.

238
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,550
Whereas in the case that we're especially interested in here

239
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,092
for, random walk-type behavior, the returns

240
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,300
are always going to be independent of where we start.

241
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,040
So prices would just introduce a lot of artifacts of history,

242
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,800
whereas the returns tell us what's actually going on.

243
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,720
And as I said, they are what's interesting for the investors.
