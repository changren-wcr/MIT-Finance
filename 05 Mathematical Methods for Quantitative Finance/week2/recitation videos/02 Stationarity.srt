00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,560
PROFESSOR: Exercise.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,650
Let's let xt be defined as z cosine omega t plus z prime

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,650
times sine omega t, where omega is a constant--

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,950
and think of it as a frequency, let's let it not be a rational

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,300
multiple of pi--

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,310
and let's let z and z prime be independent,

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,350
normalized, random variables.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,330
So show that xt is weakly stationary

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:34,030
or if you don't think it is, show that it's not.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,398
So pause the video, take a few minutes,

11
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:38,690
and see if you can work it out.

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,482
And then we'll do it on the board together.

13
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:54,950


14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,690
OK, let's take a look together.

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,040
So first of all, let's compute the mean and the variance.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,159
So the mean is going to be 0 because z

17
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,530
and z prime each have mean 0.

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:14,970
So we can compute that e of xt is going to be cosine omega t--

19
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,670
which is just a scalar with respect

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,680
to our random variable--

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,420
times the expectation of z plus sine omega t expectation

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,030
of z prime.

23
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,500
And this is 0, and this is 0, because those have mean 0,

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,470
and therefore this is equal to 0.

25
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,680
OK, that part was easy.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,030
How about the variance?

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:50,490
Well since the mean is 0, the variance of xt

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,320
is going to be the expectation of xt squared.

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,040
And again, what are we going to see? xt squared

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,660
is going to have that expression on the top, this expression.

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:11,540
We're going to have this term, squared, this term squared,

32
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,870
and a cross term of this with this.

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,810
The cross term is going to have vanishing expectation

34
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,780
because it will be an expectation of z and z prime,

35
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,330
and what we'll have is going to be--

36
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,580
just by doing it out, this is going

37
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,350
to be the expectation of z squared times cosine

38
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,900
squared omega t plus--

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:41,920


40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,840
let's try this here--

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,190
plus expectation of z prime squared times sine

42
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,430
squared omega t plus the vanishing term, which

43
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:01,005
is going to be 2 cosine omega t sine omega t expectation of z

44
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:02,790
z prime.

45
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,270
In this last term vanishes, because that's

46
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,590
equal to 0 because z and z prime are statistically independent.

47
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,370
Now this term here is equal to 1,

48
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,300
this expectation is equal to 1, so we're

49
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,200
left with cosine omega t squared plus sine squared omega

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,760
t, which is just equal to 1.

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,931


52
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:29,610
Let's keep our colors consistent if we can.

53
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,860
And that's equal to 1.

54
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,870
Now let's look at the two point function,

55
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,520
or the autocovariance function.

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:45,020
So we will look at the expectation of xt

57
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,670
with xs where t and s are just two different arbitrary points

58
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,480
in time.

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,150
We could do t and t minus k, but let's write it

60
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,840
out this way for the moment.

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,700
OK?

62
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,630
So we just substitute in, and this is our basic trick

63
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,800
for most of these.

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,070
We just substitute in the defining equations,

65
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,120
we do out the algebra, we apply linearity,

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,330
and we compute the expectations in terms of our building

67
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,360
blocks, which usually we can reduce to basic z's.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,075
So we'll be doing this trick again and again.

69
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,700
The one other trick that will be doing that you saw in lecture,

70
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,550
is will be using stationarity and recursion

71
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,770
to sometimes replace something with a t

72
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,740
by something with the t minus 1, or will take something

73
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,680
on the right hand side and use it to substitute

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,730
for the left hand side.

75
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,770
But here we're just going to do a straight calculation

76
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,560
for this problem.

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,260
So what's xt?

78
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:44,900
Well xt was given by the z cosine omega

79
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:51,650
t plus z prime sine omega t.

80
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,880
And x sub s is given by the same thing,

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,200
just with t replaced by s, z cosine omega s plus z

82
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,490
prime sine omega s.

83
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,140
And let's close all our brackets.

84
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,250


85
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,140
And now what are we going to have?

86
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,620
Well we're going to have the two z's will come together.

87
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:30,420
So we're going to have the expectation of z squared times

88
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,860
cosine omega t cosine omega s.

89
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,600


90
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,790
And if you can see where we're going with this,

91
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,620
I'll write this out just this one time

92
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,620
and then I'll start doing these a little faster.

93
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,210
We're going to have also expectation

94
00:05:50,210 --> 00:06:00,600
of z prime squared times sine omega t sine omega s,

95
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,520
and then we have the cross terms,

96
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,950
which involve z multiplied by z prime and z prime multiplied

97
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,760
by z.

98
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,230
But we don't need to keep those, we

99
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,410
know that the expectation of z times z prime vanishes.

100
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,840
So what we're left with here then

101
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:31,980
is cosine omega t cosine omega s plus sine omega t sine omega s.

102
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,230
And if you recall from trigonometry,

103
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,850
that's the formula for the difference of angles.

104
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,520
So this is equal to cosine of omega times t minus s.

105
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,700
Now the exact form is not that important,

106
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,730
although it's kind of cute that this comes out.

107
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,920
The important thing is that it depends only

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,170
on the difference t minus s.

109
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:57,390
So stationarity is the property that if we shift t and s--

110
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,210
if we shift these two points by an equal amount,

111
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,200
that all the expectations of the probability

112
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
distributions, at least the first and second moments all

113
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,180
stay the same.

114
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,780
And here that's satisfied.

115
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,680
We see that the mean was 0, the variance

116
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,550
was 1 independent of time, and the two point function

117
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,090
which does depend on time, does so only

118
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,680
through differences between those two points.
