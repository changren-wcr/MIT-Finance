1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:08,650
PROFESSOR: Exercise-- let's let xt be zt plus theta zt minus 2.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,900
The z's are IID normalized random variables,

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,790
means 0 in variance 1.

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,050
And let's let A be the average of the first four

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,410
observations-- let's say x1, x2, x3, x4.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,910
And you can generalize this, and you

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,160
should after you've done this.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,370
But here, let's try this.

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,650
Using the results that we did in the previous exercise,

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,150
let's see what we can say about computing the mean

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,230
and the variance of A So pause the video now.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,000
And A is an average.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,980
It doesn't have a time index, but it's

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,340
based on a particular set, not an infinite sum

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,460
of random variables.

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,520
So A constitutes a new random variable.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,900
What it its mean?

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,815
What is its variance?

19
00:00:53,815 --> 00:01:05,030


20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,410
Let's compute.

21
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,180
Plug in the formulas and take some expectations.

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,040
So first of all, it should be obvious that the expectation

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,750
of A is going to be 0, because it's the sum of a bunch of 0

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,240
mean variables, each of the x's.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,660
What about the variance?

26
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,760
So we have the expectation of A squared.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,460
This is the variance of A with the covariance

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,080
of A with itself.

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,380
Sorry, let me rewrite that.

30
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:47,010
Let's do it a little bit more neatly, as A. And then

31
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,480
let's just use our definition.

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:02:00,500
This is going to be 1/16 the expectation of x1 plus x2

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,672
plus x3 plus x4, quantity squared.

34
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:09,380
So what we're going to do, is we're going

35
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,850
to expand out the quadratic.

36
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,900


37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,050
Take expectations, simplify terms,

38
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,045
and get our result. So what do we have here?

39
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:21,670
We're going to have two kinds of terms.

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,090
We're going to have terms in x1 squared plus x2 squared

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,707
plus x3 squared plus x4 squared.

42
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:28,790
Let's just write this out.

43
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,910
This is going to be 1/16 of--

44
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,080
now, we'll have the expectation of let's just

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,000
call it x1 squared plus 2 squared

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,410
plus 3 squared plus x4 squared.

47
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,660
But remember, these are independent

48
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,050
and identically distributed.

49
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,497
So that whatever the variance is,

50
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:53,830
they all have the same variance.

51
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,410
And actually, we know what that variances.

52
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,550
This is going to give us 4 times 1 plus theta squared,

53
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,010
because we just computed that.

54
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,610


55
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,150
Now, what about the cross term?

56
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,370
So the cross terms are going to be interesting.

57
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,213
So we're going to have 2x 1x2 plus 2x 2x3 and so on.

58
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:13,880
But the only ones that are going to have

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,400
non-vanishing expectation are going

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,510
to be x1, x3, and x2, x4, because they're

61
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,580
separated by two time indices.

62
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,170
That's the calculation that we just did a moment ago

63
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,680
in the previous exercise.

64
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,260
So we're going to have this plus-- let me write down

65
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:40,510
2 expectation of x1, x3 plus twice

66
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:46,100
the expectation of x2, x4.

67
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,130
And we'll close our big bracket over here.

68
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,570
And we know what those are.

69
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,540
This is going to be plus 2 theta,

70
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,010
plus 2 more theta over here.

71
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,500
So we have our final result--

72
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,780
the variance of A is going to be 1/4 of 1

73
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,810
plus theta plus theta squared.

74
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,520
Again, our principles were take the basic process,

75
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,930
expand out the things inside the expectation,

76
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,790
write things out algebraically.

77
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,180
Expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations.

78
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,450
Reduce things down to z's or to previously known product

79
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,440
formulas.

80
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,400
And then, get the final numbers in terms of the parameters

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,360
of the problem.

82
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,170
And there we are.

83
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,500
I hope that answer matches yours.

84
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,000
