1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,760
PROFESSOR: Consider a stationary process.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,370
xt is epsilon t plus theta times epsilon t minus 2, where theta

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,210
is a constant and epsilon is a 0 mean random variable

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,800
with variance sigma squared.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,830
So this is a notation you'll often see in the literature,

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,470
and you can be tempted in fact, you can just rescale the sigma

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,500
and re express things in terms of a completely standardized

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,400
random variable z.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,020
They're just simple linear transformations.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,990
But in this notation, we would typically

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,060
write that the expectation is 0, that the variance is sigma

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,370
squared, and since the mean is 0 the covariance of epsilon t

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,640
and epsilon s is equal to 0 unless t is equal to s.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,835
So when t and s are different we get 0,

15
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:52,710
and when t and s are equal, we get the previous result.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,250
We sometimes write those in a compact notation

17
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,500
using the Kroncker delta notation,

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,330
where that's simply defined here.

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,390
This delta t sub s just is something

20
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,660
that's 1 when the indices are equal and it's 0 otherwise.

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,180
So here's our question.

22
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,660
Is the series x sub d stationary?

23
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,830
And find the mean, the variance and the autocorrelation

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,220
function.

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,355
So why don't you pause the video, solve these questions,

26
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:25,730
and then come back and we'll do it together on the board.

27
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:44,410


28
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,250
OK.

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,690
Let's look at solving this problem.

30
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,030
First of all, is it stationary?

31
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,310
It is a stationary series because we have

32
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,240
expressed things recursively.

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
If we shift things in time, we still

34
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,340
have the same relative relationship

35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,580
of the axis across different points in time.

36
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,000
How about computing the mean?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,120
Well the mean we can do just by expectation.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,680
We take expectations it's linear,

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,460
so we have that the expectation of x--

40
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,200
this is zero expectation, and this

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,190
is theta times 0 expectation, so that's equal to 0.

42
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,240
How about the rest of it?

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,375


44
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,000
Well I'm going to simplify things a bit

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,860
by letting epsilon t be sigma zt.

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,895
And then I'm going to divide through by sigma.

47
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:38,520
I'm going to keep calling my variable--

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,630
I'll call it little x, and then at the end

49
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,500
we can switch variables and we can multiply everything

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,710
through by sigma if we'd like.

51
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,410
So I'm going to have the defining equation

52
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,350
that xt is now going to be zt plus theta

53
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,960
times z of t minus 2.

54
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,055
And we've seen that the expectation of xt is 0.

55
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:11,050
The variance is xt squared, and that's just

56
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:20,830
the expectation of zt plus theta zt minus 2 quantity squared.

57
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,830
Obviously what's going to happen as we expand this out,

58
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,320
the cross term will have vanishing expectation

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,150
because zt and zt minus 2 are necessarily two time steps

60
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,880
apart.

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,470
So that's going to vanish, and the final term

62
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,210
we're going to be left with is going

63
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:45,460
to be expectation of zt squared plus theta squared expectation

64
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:51,590
of zt minus 2 quantity squared, or in other words

65
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,330
1 plus theta squared.

66
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,690
And if we multiply through by sigma squared,

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,030
we'll get the answer to our original question

68
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,820
in terms of big X. Is that what you got?

69
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,360
All right, now let's take a look at the autocorrelation function

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,120
and things will get interesting.

71
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,758
So the autocorrelation function, or ACF is defined--

72
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:11,425
and we're just going to do calculations,

73
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,870
so we're just going to use our definitions.

74
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,959
So our ACF is going to be obtained

75
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:27,850
by just computing expectation of xt and xt minus k.

76
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,580
Now remember, this is a special case when the means are 0.

77
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,560
More generally what we properly should write

78
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,860
is it's the covariance of xt in xt minus k.

79
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,110
But it's the same as this expectation in the case

80
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,270
where the means are 0, and otherwise

81
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,730
as we know we would subtract off the product

82
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,050
of the expectations.

83
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,840
So what do we do?

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,690
Let's just substitute in.

85
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:57,160
So we have this is going to be the expectation of zt

86
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,790
plus theta zt minus 2--

87
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,140
let's change colors here--

88
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:13,860
times z of t minus k plus theta of zt minus k minus 2.

89
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,880


90
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,560
Now when we do the expectation, what's going to happen?

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,930
Well, we know that zt could be paired with--

92
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,550
it can't be the same as this one,

93
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,380
we're excluding the case where k equals 0.

94
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,430
We've already done that, that's the variance.

95
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,670
So we know the t and t minus k have to be different.

96
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,910
And we know that t minus 2 and t minus 2 minus k

97
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,270
have to be different.

98
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,980
So the term with no thetas and determined theta squared are

99
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,230
both going to have varnishing expectations of the z's.

100
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,830
So we're left with two possible terms.

101
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:08,560
So we're left with theta times the expectation of z

102
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:19,870
t minus 2 times z t minus k plus theta times the expectation

103
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:29,810
of zt with z t minus k minus 2.

104
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,620
Now usually, one comment I should make

105
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,470
is that often we do things only for positive k

106
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,970
and we think going forward.

107
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,100
Formally for stationary series--

108
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,510
and it's a property you can check

109
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,430
and you can show from the definition--

110
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,760
that if we take k to minus k, that the autocovariance

111
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,020
functions are the same.

112
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,420
We often don't think of them that way because we usually

113
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,700
want to think about autocovariance and lag

114
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,620
variables because we expect information

115
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,660
to propagate forward in time, not backward in time.

116
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,020
So there's no time travel rule in finance.

117
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,330
But formally we could have either of these, but what

118
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,910
we can see is if we look at the two expressions,

119
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,940
we can see right away that generally they will vanish

120
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,820
except if k is equal to 2.

121
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,020
If k is equal to 2, then the first expression

122
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,700
will have expectation 1, and otherwise it will vanish.

123
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,180
And in the second term, this one here,

124
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,720
this will generally vanish unless k were equal to minus 2,

125
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,280
in which case this would give me an expectation of 1

126
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,230
and this expectation would vanish.

127
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,210
So either way when we put these together,

128
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:58,630
what we're going to get is that this is equal to theta

129
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:07,330
if k is equal to plus or minus 2, and it's equal to 0

130
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,050
otherwise.

131
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,840


132
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,830
And of course, if we want to go back and put in our sigmas,

133
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,600
we would multiply this through by sigma squared.

134
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,140
So the interesting thing about this structure

135
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,340
is that it's only a quadratic term, it's very simple algebra

136
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,420
that we've done.

137
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,900
And because of the way the variables get paired together,

138
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,990
there are only certain combinations

139
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,700
that have a chance of meeting.

140
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,549
So we've reduced something that does involve

141
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,620
lag propagation of time, so there

142
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,409
are things that are moving forward two time steps ahead.

143
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,770
But when we express things in terms of the z's, we

144
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,800
need the z's to be coincident, or the same time index,

145
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,740
and that picks out the terms that are going to be there,

146
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,540
and then the result is just what we

147
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,260
get by doing a little bit of algebra.

148
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,000
