1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,870
PROFESSOR: We study discrete time stochastic processes

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,050
in order to develop models that help us make inferences

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,960
and predictions about data that's observed over time.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,558
We look to the past to understand how data arose

5
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,100
and to try to figure out what the underlying mechanisms where

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,980
they produced it, and we look to the future

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,470
in applying models to make predictions and to take action.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,230
So time series models are useful in a number of ways.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,790
They can summarize data, provide useful descriptive statistics

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,070
such as measures of serial correlation,

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,470
they can be used for filtering, for detrending,

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,180
and more generally to differentiate

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,360
a noisy background from potentially meaningful signals

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,070
that might otherwise be obscured.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,680
By quantifying the balance between signal and noise

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,870
in the context of a model, we can

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,800
have some guidance in identifying opportunities

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,810
and managing risk.

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,630
Most financial market data is noisy.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,790
Can we determine whether two sets of data

21
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,830
describe similar market conditions?

22
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,390
Did they come from the same model?

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,420
Do they have the same underlying data generating process?

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,069
Did an old model break?

25
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,930
Has there been a new regime change?

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,893
If we need a new model, how do we know when it's needed?

27
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:11,310
How do we know what its connection

28
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,840
should be with the old one?

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Time series models help us perform simulations,

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,410
make predictions, evaluate data adequacy,

31
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,280
quantify expected performance, and improve decision making.

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,020
Now we started with a bunch of stationary models,

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,330
and in this recitation we'll do a few exercises

34
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,130
and we'll talk about stationarity.

35
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,720
So stationarity means that we can shift the model in time.

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,890
It doesn't have a fixed origin.

37
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,050
That means when we write down things, definitions like these,

38
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,300
that if we shift the time index--

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,950
not that the data will be the same,

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,350
but that the probability distributions are the same

41
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,610
and that the defining equations are the same.

42
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,370
And you can see that for each of these,

43
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,480
for the generalized random walk model, for this moving average

44
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,863
model, and for our old friend the AR1 model.

45
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:02,280
In each of these cases if you were

46
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,460
to replace t by t plus k or t minus

47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,539
l, the equation would take the same form.

48
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,355
Now stationarity in reality is much too strong a condition.

49
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:15,480
It would almost never hold.

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,850
First of all, it would require that the conditions

51
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,170
be the same forever.

52
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,780
And financial markets haven't been around forever,

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,210
and they might be around forever in the future,

54
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,180
but certainly not under identical conditions.

55
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,170
So what we really require for applying them--

56
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,570
we don't expect it to literally hold in practice,

57
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,778
but for the mathematics to be sensibly applied

58
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:38,820
we have a couple of things that we need to check.

59
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,237
One thing that we want to check is

60
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:42,450
this thing about long memory.

61
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,770
Do we need things infinitely far in the past?

62
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,820
So if we can find out and show in our models

63
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,910
that the initial conditions do not

64
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,970
have an infinitely long persistence over time,

65
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,972
that after some period of time at least

66
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:58,680
the behavior of the models doesn't depend

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,510
on the specific initial conditions,

68
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,480
or if it started a finite point in the past, then

69
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,930
at least we have a chance of applying these usefully.

70
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,720
Second, we don't want full stationarity.

71
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,550
We usually only require something

72
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,640
called weak stationarity, which uses

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,560
the first and second moments only.

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,630
So it says that the first moments, the means,

75
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,200
should be time invariant, and the second moments,

76
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,810
the variances and two point functions

77
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,880
like the autocovariance functions,

78
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,060
should depend only on the difference in time indices,

79
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,840
not on the exact location of a particular point in time.

80
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,510
And that's a good thing because usually

81
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,160
don't know what the higher moments are,

82
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,577
and we certainly don't know that everything is stationary.

83
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:43,390
So weaker conditions are good for us.

84
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,620
So keep in mind that the financial world does change.

85
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,590
We don't expect to find universal laws that will always

86
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,560
be applicable, we expect them to hold some period of time.

87
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,120
It might be a number of years, it

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,800
might be in a high frequency trading

89
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,550
context for a number of days, but there's

90
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,180
some persistence over which we can apply these models to help

91
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,520
understand signals and noise.

92
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,380
And if we're lucky, a model will be successful for a long time.

93
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,790
It'll have a good and stable run,

94
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,430
but eventually we want to be on the lookout for when

95
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,960
it will no longer be useful.

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,930
When it comes to an end it could be through a crash, a crisis,

97
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,530
a pandemic, or changes in behavior, changes

98
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,290
in institutions, changes in systems

99
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,390
of financial intermediation.

100
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,310
But for right now what we want to discuss

101
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,220
are some practical ways that we can

102
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,680
look at some examples of problems

103
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,210
with stationary time series using our tools of linearity

104
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,250
of expectation operators, and now we

105
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,150
add this additional feature that, for a stationary series,

106
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,350
we can shift them in time.

107
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,530
And that means that we can use translations or recursion,

108
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,490
and it can take a number of different forms.
