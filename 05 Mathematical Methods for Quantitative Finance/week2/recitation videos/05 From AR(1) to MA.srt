1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,109
PROFESSOR: Let Rt minus mu be equal to minus lambda

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,720
times Rt minus 1 minus mu plus sigma zt,

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,130
that's the definition of our AR1 process.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,140
Now can you show that this AR1 process can be rewritten

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,960
as a moving average process?

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,660
Let me give you two hints.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,730
Number one is to use recursion, and number two is to keep

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,140
in mind what the goal is, is to express Rt on the left hand

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,900
side, and something that doesn't have any R's on the right hand

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,840
side that only has z's.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,460
That's a general rule that we have.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,610
They can be of different lags, but there should be only

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,690
z's on the right hand side and no R's.

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,420
So see if you can do that, come back.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,790
Pause the video, see if you can work it out, and then come back

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,575
and we'll look at it together.

17
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:14,030


18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,380
So I'm going to simplify notation a little bit for me

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,600
by removing some of the scaling, let's

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,480
get rid of the mu's and the sigmas and boil things down

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,620
so they're a little bit easier to follow.

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,060
So I'm going to define a new variable

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:37,350
I'll call y sub t to just be Rt minus mu divided by sigma.

24
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,040
So you notice that this looks like a standardized random

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,520
variable, but be careful because the sigma is not necessarily

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,790
the variance of R. In fact, we know it's not.

27
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,330
It's the parameter that multiplies z.

28
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,140
So this is just a definition, and in terms

29
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:02,570
of which I can rewrite my AR1 process of the form yt

30
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:11,300
is equal to minus lambda yt plus z sub t.

31
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,160
Now what I'm going to do is make a series

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,270
of recursive substitutions.

33
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,220
So the first thing I'm going to do

34
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,270
is I'm going to leave this zt right here.

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,650
And what I'm going to do-- oops, sorry.

36
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,700
This should be minus 1, very important.

37
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,030
So what I'm going to do-- so this is our expression,

38
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,830
let's just compare it and check.

39
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,620
So what I've done up here is I've divided through by sigma,

40
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,540
and then after dividing through by sigma,

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,850
this is y sub t, which is here.

42
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,820
The minus lambda stays, this divided by sigma

43
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,750
is y sub t minus 1, and then zt over here

44
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,740
comes from dividing this term by sigma.

45
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,580
So that's just our previous expression.

46
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,260
What I'm going to do, though, is now

47
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,460
I'm going to take this piece here

48
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,700
and I'm going to take y sub t minus 1

49
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,540
and substitute it in this expression.

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,900
So it'll be a little bit more convenient

51
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,160
if I put the z on the left hand side.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,350
So let's do it like this.

53
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,830
I'm going to write down that yt is

54
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:28,040
equal to zt minus lambda times y t minus 1,

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,340
but that's the same thing as zt minus lambda times--

56
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,990
let's change colors.

57
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:45,650
Now y t minus 1 is just z t minus 1 minus lambda times y

58
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,500
of t minus 2.

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:57,990
That is, this expression here just corresponds to this

60
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,850
by using this entire definition.

61
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,050
That is, if I take t and I replace it by t minus 1,

62
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,280
this becomes t minus 1, this becomes t minus 2,

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,510
and that's what I have here.

64
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,480
This is z t minus 1 minus lambda times y of t minus 2.

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,589
We simplify, and then we do it again.

66
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:26,100
So to simplify, this is going to be zt minus lambda times

67
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,440
z t minus 1.

68
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,720
And now I'm going to have plus lambda squared times

69
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,890
y of t minus 2.

70
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,470
Let's substitute in for that y of t minus 2.

71
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,130


72
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:57,830
This is going to be equal to zt minus lambda z t minus 1

73
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:11,000
plus lambda squared times z t minus 2 minus lambda of y t

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,900
minus 3.

75
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,330


76
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,250
And we can simplify that.

77
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,730
Let's expand that out and you can see the pattern coming.

78
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:32,880
z t minus 1 plus lambda squared z t minus 2 now minus lambda

79
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,990
cubed times y of t minus 3.

80
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,780
So we're going to keep going, and what's going to happen

81
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,600
is we're going to push the y farther and farther off

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,553
to the side.

83
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:47,970
And there there's one thing that's

84
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,600
important to keep in mind, which is that lambda, remember, must

85
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,270
be less than 1 in absolute magnitude, otherwise

86
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,830
this series blows up.

87
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,790
So we can imagine that as we push y farther and farther

88
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,570
back--

89
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,390
because t minus 3, t minus 4, t minus 5--

90
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,700
each time it's being made smaller and smaller,

91
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,610
not only can we run this recursion infinitely,

92
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,340
assuming we could go infinitely far back,

93
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,400
but any residual term that's left over

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,810
is getting smaller, and smaller, and smaller.

95
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,980
So finally, we can write this as an MA series,

96
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,140
but the trick is it's of infinite order.

97
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,790
So what do we get?

98
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,160
We write this out and we can summarize our result.

99
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,120
So we continue going down, and finally what we're left with

100
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,510
is an expression that y sub t can

101
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,210
be written as the sum from k equals 0

102
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:51,040
to infinity of minus lambda to the kz sub t minus k.

103
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,300


104
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,810
So this is our formal result for this expression.

105
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,930
We know that in practice we're not really

106
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,910
going to be able to do infinite sums,

107
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,730
but we expect that it's going to be a good approximation if we

108
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,310
truncate after a reasonable number of terms

109
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,030
because they're all being suppressed by powers of lambda.

110
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,220
So even if this is a formal expression,

111
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,320
it encodes one thing that's actually quite important,

112
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,310
which is that this is not just an infinite sum

113
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,210
in both directions.

114
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,390
It's a semi-infinite sum into the past.

115
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,470
What that means is that this shows that yt,

116
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,460
because it can be expressed as a sum of all of the previous

117
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,930
z's--

118
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,570
and I've eliminated the previous y's,

119
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,500
so we're back to our original variables,

120
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,640
remember that this is in fact the same thing

121
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,410
as Rt minus mu over sigma.

122
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:59,630
So we can write this for R sub t as just sigma times yt plus mu.

123
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,440
What this shows is that it depends only

124
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,840
on z's of the same time or earlier.

125
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,320
So in particular, it means that if we

126
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,810
take two different times--

127
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,220
if I were to compute, for example,

128
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:25,120
the expectation of z sub s with y sub t,

129
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:33,500
this is going to be 0 whenever t is earlier than s.

130
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,230
So if we pick a point subsequently,

131
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,470
this term here, this sum includes

132
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:47,170
from our starting point, from lag 0

133
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,170
from t, all the way to the past-- t minus 1, t minus 2,

134
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,560
t minus 3, if we pick something that happens after that it

135
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,800
is necessarily uncorrelated.

136
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,310
And that means-- in coming back to our AR1 model--

137
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,330
that we have an interesting result that's

138
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,585
actually important in doing other derivations.

139
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:08,860
And now that we've shown it, it should

140
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:17,840
be intuitively reasonable that whenever

141
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,800
we have crossed terms of this form--

142
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,670
whenever we look at the expectation or the covariance

143
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,960
of one of the z's--

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,330
one of the noise terms with one of the excess return pieces,

145
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,110
the Rt minus mu, at a different point in time

146
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,180
this expectation is going to vanish.

147
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,740
These have no covariance.

148
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,350
So intuitively, it makes sense that the noise

149
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,740
is independent of the general variable,

150
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,400
but now here, we can see that as a consequence

151
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,810
of the temporal structure, that we can write the AR1 process

152
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,160
in terms of an MA1 process in the semi-infinite past

153
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,940
or in the infinite past.

154
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,467
