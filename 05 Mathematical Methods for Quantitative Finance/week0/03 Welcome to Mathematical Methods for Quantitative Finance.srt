PAUL MENDE: Welcome to 15.455x, Mathematical Methods

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,720
of Quantitative Finance.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,440
I'm Paul Mende, and I'm your instructor for this course.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,610
The main topics that we cover are probability, time series

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,330
models, discrete-time stochastic processes,

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,140
continuous-time processes, linear algebra,

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,510
and optimization.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,410
Our approach in this course is to develop mathematical methods

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,390
that are applied in finance.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,920
We're oriented toward practical and innovative problem solving.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,630
So we'd like you to understand where the ideas come from,

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,610
how to use them, not only in standard situations,

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,310
but in novel ones, where maybe some

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,740
of the standard assumptions don't apply.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,770
We'll survey the key ideas and tools and methods

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,340
in each of these areas.

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,400
And we'll provide a foundation for applications

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,460
in industry and research and for further study,

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,530
depending on where you are in your career

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,870
and where you are in your studies.

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,250
Learning in the class is very much hands on.

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,400
You'll be doing examples, you'll be doing problems,

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,960
you'll be doing applications.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,350
And mostly, you should be asking questions all the time.

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,470
Where does this apply?

26
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,700
What do the results mean?

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,400
What are some counterexamples?

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,830
How do we generalize?

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,570
We begin with probability because

30
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,820
of the basic observation that financial data

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,020
is noisy and financial data--

32
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,910
excuse me, financial decisions, more generally,

33
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,920
are characterized by uncertainty.

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,470
So we need probability.

35
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,020
Probability is the language of uncertainty.

36
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,470
And we want to ultimately be describing an uncertain world

37
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,980
and making good decisions under uncertain conditions.

38
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,560
So we begin with the basic review

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,525
of probability and a few key ideas

40
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:50,310
that we'll be building on to describe how events unfold

41
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,670
in a sometimes noisy world.

42
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,610
Look at discrete-time stochastic processes

43
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,750
that characterize the evolution of random variables

44
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,720
to describe financial and econometric quantities.

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,150
We want to think about the entire past, present,

46
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,210
and future trajectory of different quantities

47
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,250
of interest.

48
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,480
So we'll be developing some specific time series

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,810
models that find a variety of applications.

50
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,510
We'll be looking at numerical, as well as analytical,

51
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,570
techniques to solving closed form, to solve numerically.

52
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,550
We'll see how to estimate parameters

53
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,520
and how to identify what might be the appropriate model

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,060
for different situations.

55
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,430
We'll then take a look at things in continuous time,

56
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,530
and we'll see it's much more interesting

57
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,040
than simply your ordinary delta t goes to 0 limit.

58
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,540
We'll see stochastic processes become fractals,

59
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,440
and we need a whole new calculus, the ito calculus,

60
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,330
to describe stochastic financial variables.

61
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,760
So we'll develop that.

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,180
And then we'll see how we can go from these stochastic equations

63
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,180
back to more familiar partial differential equations

64
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,160
and look at some of the key equations that

65
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,460
are important in finance and some that have application

66
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,940
to important areas, such as derivative pricing,

67
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,160
option pricing, and so on.

68
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,810
We'll look at linear algebra, because pricing relationships

69
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,170
and many other relationships among financial variables

70
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,040
are linear.

71
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,400
And linear algebra captures the essential relationships

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,770
and constraints among financial quantities

73
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,940
to identify what are independent drivers, to identify

74
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,700
how many independent securities might be in a market,

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,730
and we'll look at applications, such as market completeness,

76
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,600
security replication, and arbitrage.

77
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,840
Finally, we'll look at optimization.

78
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
Whether it's trading, investments,

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
or other kind of decision making under uncertainty,

80
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,440
we'd like to take the best action or find the best policy.

81
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,800
We often have to do so in the presence not only of

82
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,280
uncertainty, but constraints.

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,530
So we'll take a look at constrained optimization

84
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,480
in single and multivariate settings,

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,050
in a single period settings, and over multiple time horizons.
