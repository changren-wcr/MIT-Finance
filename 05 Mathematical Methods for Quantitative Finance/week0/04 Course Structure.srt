00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,920
EGOR MATVEYEV: In this video, I would

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,170
like to talk more specifically about the structure

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,520
of this course.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,560
It is an instructor-based course,

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,080
and we will be releasing content each Wednesday

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,600
at 15:00 hours, Coordinated Universal Time or UTC.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,620
Each week's content will have three components-- lectures,

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,110
recitations, and problem sets.

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,570
Lecture videos deliver the main content

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,450
and introduce you to major concepts.

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,270
We encourage you to engage with the concept checks that

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,490
accompany the lectures.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,410
We have received feedback from our learners

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,930
that these are a useful learning tool,

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,960
and we hope that they help you understand the material

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,730
of each learning module.

17
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,120
Recitations are designed to bridge the gap between lectures

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,800
and problem sets.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,220
The recitation content will help you understand and apply

20
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,800
the relevant lecture concepts and will

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,540
help you to solidify your understanding of the material.

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,390
Problem sets in this course are due each Wednesday

23
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,410
at 15:00 hours UTC.

24
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,960
You have exactly one week to finish problem sets.

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,600
As a matter of policy, homework deadlines will not be extended.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,730
We do recognize, however, that circumstances

27
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,230
can arise that prevent you from meeting every single deadline,

28
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,060
and we want to offer some flexibility.

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,090
Therefore, we will drop your lowest homework score

30
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,100
at the end of the course.

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,890
We would like to emphasize the importance

32
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,290
of working diligently and consistently

33
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,000
throughout the course.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,890
Do not fall behind.

35
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,640
Content is cumulative.

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,240
And, if you do not work consistently,

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,720
it will be difficult to catch up.

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,900
Data shows positive correlation between consistent work

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,190
and final exam scores.

40
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,330
In other words, if you would like to get a higher grade,

41
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,990
you need to work consistently.

42
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,230
My advice to you is to start each week's work early

43
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,170
and to put effort into learning the material.

44
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,080
You should plan to spend at least 10 hours a week

45
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,211
to succeed in this course.

46
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:08,669
You will not pass this course if you spend two hours a week

47
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,900
on it.

48
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,760
Because of this time commitment, we

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,420
advise you to first realistically determine

50
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,020
if you can afford to spend this much time each week.

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,620
If you decide to take this course,

52
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,760
we strongly advise you to plan ahead, to schedule time

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,700
each week to study, and to work consistently.

54
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,220
Our teaching team includes PhD students

55
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,580
who will help you learn the content of the course.

56
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,370
To interact with the teaching team and your peers,

57
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,360
use the discussion forum.

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,930
The discussion forum is your one-stop shop

59
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,990
designed to address all course-related questions.

60
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,260
If you want to interact with your fellow learners

61
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,300
or if you have a question that you would like

62
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,880
to ask the teaching team, we invite you

63
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,980
to participate in the forum.

64
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,190
The forum has two types of posts, a question

65
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,720
or a discussion.

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,290
The difference between the two is as follows.

67
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,390
If you just want to share some insight or make a comment,

68
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,190
post a comment as a discussion.

69
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,710
However, if you would like to receive an answer,

70
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,090
then post it as a question.

71
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,190
Here are some specific tips.

72
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,080
Before asking a question, take time

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,050
to think about the material.

74
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,660
Rewatch the video lecture or recitation video.

75
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,660
We have invested considerable resources

76
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,540
in making the content very clear.

77
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,670
So chances are, if you have a question,

78
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,700
the answer is already there.

79
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,910
When asking a question on the forum, be specific.

80
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,330
Provide a descriptive title so it is easy for your peers

81
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,270
to find your question, and it's also easy for us

82
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,270
to understand what a question is about.

83
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,280
We have designated discussion points

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,820
at the end of each module.

85
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,670
So make sure to post your questions

86
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,290
in the relevant forum.

87
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,630
Always be polite and respectful.

88
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,220
We have learners from all corners

89
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,490
of the world from different cultures and backgrounds.

90
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,020
Please be polite and respect each other.

91
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,560
We take ethics very seriously.

92
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,540
During the final exam period, we will

93
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,370
close the discussion forum.

94
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,380
The final exam is individual work,

95
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,780
and we do not allow learners to share information

96
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,700
or to collaborate.

97
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,279
We expect you to follow the honor code of edX

98
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,600
and to uphold MIT's standards of academic integrity.

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,550
We are glad you're with us.

100
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,160
Welcome to Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,910
and to our MicroMasters program.
