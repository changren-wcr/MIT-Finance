00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,882
EGOR MATVEYEV: Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,882 --> 00:00:03,350
And welcome to mathematical methods

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,180
for quantitative finance.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,150
This course is part of a MIT's MicroMasters Program

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,830
in Finance.

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,920
To the learners who have taken other courses in this series,

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,240
welcome back.

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,740
To the learners who are joining us for the first time,

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,570
I would like to welcome you to our MicroMasters program.

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,070
My name is Egor Matveyev.

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,830
I'm the executive director of the MicroMasters program

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,770
and a faculty member of the Finance Group at MIT Sloan

13
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,270
School of Management.

14
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,600
I joined the Finance Group at MIT Sloan four years ago.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,660
I have taught various finance courses in our MBA,

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,200
master's in finance, and MBA Sloan Fellows program.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,450
The scope of my teaching includes introductory classes

18
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,520
to MBA students and Sloan Fellows,

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,580
as well as an advanced elective in corporate finance.

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,430
I also teach MIT Sloan's action learning course

21
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,490
in corporate finance and investment banking.

22
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,010
My academic research covers areas of corporate finance,

23
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,700
corporate governance, organizational economics,

24
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,800
and asset management with a particular focus

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,670
on asset management of nonprofit foundations and endowments.

26
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,410
In this video, I would like to give you

27
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,040
an overview of the MicroMasters Program in Finance.

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,920
Our program consists of five courses--

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,440
Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance,

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,830
Foundations of Modern Finance parts I and II,

31
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,500
Financial Accounting, and Derivatives Markets.

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,900
By successfully completing all five courses,

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,840
you will earn the MicroMasters credential in finance from MIT.

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,380
How does completing the MicroMasters program in finance

35
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,920
benefit you?

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,360
First, it can be used to advance your career.

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,820
All of our courses have the same rigorous content

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,620
that we teach to our in-resident students at MIT Sloan.

39
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,540
In all our courses, we have developed

40
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,110
individual proctored exams that allow us to test your knowledge

41
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,060
and allows you to show your understanding of the subject.

42
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,040
Our testing process is rigorous and complies

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,210
with our internal practices for MIT students.

44
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,040
Earning our credential will allow

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,320
you to demonstrate your financial knowledge

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,820
and your skills at the level of the MIT Sloan.

47
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,610
Second, our MicroMasters credential

48
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,190
can be a first step in earning a master's degree

49
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:22,530
in finance, either at MIT or at our pathway universities.

50
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,800
If you're currently a sophomore in an undergraduate program,

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,135
starting our MicroMasters program now

52
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:29,760
would allow you to complete the program

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,420
by the beginning of your senior year,

54
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,760
right in time for your applications

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,250
to master's programs.

56
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,290
At MIT Sloan School of Management,

57
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,690
learners who earn the MicroMasters credential

58
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,590
in finance are eligible to receive credit for four courses

59
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,500
upon acceptance into the program.

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,810
This would allow you to waive the summer term

61
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,000
and accelerate program completion.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,540
The list of pathway universities that accept our MicroMasters

63
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,930
credential is growing and is available on our website.

64
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,000
Even if you are not currently interested in a full master's

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,850
degree, our MicroMasters credential

66
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,400
may give you an edge in the labor market,

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,560
as our committee of credential holders

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,500
grows and more employers become familiar

69
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,590
with the rigor of our content and testing.

70
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,240
You're also welcome to take our individual courses.

71
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,660
For example, if you already have a strong general foundation

72
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,120
in finance and you would like to deepen

73
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,850
your understanding of derivative securities and markets,

74
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,500
you can take our derivatives course

75
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,020
and earn a certificate specifically for that course.
