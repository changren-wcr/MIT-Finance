1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,490
PROFESSOR: The quantity V satisfies a differential

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,580
equation that's very similar to the Black-Scholes equation.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,350
The prefactor we put in front, the e to the minus rt minus t,

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,310
the discounting factor adds an extra term minus rV

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,890
when we take time partials with respect to it.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,880
One partial acts on the prefactor,

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,370
the other partial acts on the function

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,990
V, and we can cancel out an overall prefactor

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,070
in the equation.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,200
So the equation that's satisfied by V

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,300
looks very similar to Black-Scholes,

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,920
except there's a mu here.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,610
And what we ought to have is an r where we see a mu.

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,460
Now, V would satisfy the Black-Scholes equation

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,780
if instead it were based on this Ito process.

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,760
dS equals rSdt plus sigma SdB.

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,040
That is, if we changed the drift rate

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,410
and replaced it by the risk-free rate,

19
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,200
then the equation would be Black-Scholes.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,870
And what that means is that if we

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,440
want to solve the Black-Scholes equation, what we can do

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,530
is take the expression we wrote down for V, everywhere where

23
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,130
we see mu, cancel it out and replace it

24
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,700
by r, and that's going to satisfy this differential

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,870
equation.

26
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,110
Now, there's a reason for this that we're not driving here,

27
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,870
but you'll see it in the finance portion of the MicroMasters

28
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,770
course.

29
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,760
And what you'll see is that this is called risk-neutral pricing.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,490
Risk neutral you can think of as meaning that there's

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,980
no particular compensation for risk,

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,725
that all assets under risk-neutral pricing

33
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:39,140
and under risk-neutral probabilities

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,000
grow at the risk-free rate.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,010
So under this assumption that we're using the risk-neutral

36
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,800
measure, sometimes called Q-measure,

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,320
and that the Ito process evolves not with a real-world value mu,

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,440
but with this fictitious drift rate r--

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,830
under that set of assumptions, then we

40
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,600
can find a solution to the Black-Scholes equation.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,840
And we know that the V that we wrote down before

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,110
solves that, provided we make that substitution.

43
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,660
And here is the relationship that we have

44
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,550
that V must satisfy.

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:19,760
The e to the minus rt times V at S of t at an earlier time

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,410
is equal to the expectation of e to the minus r big T

47
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,340
at a later time of the value of the function evaluated

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,270
at that later time, where this expectation is taken

49
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,670
by averaging over the probabilities

50
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,630
for all possible values of ST at future time

51
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,950
big T under the probability density that is not

52
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,340
the real-world one with mu, but the risk-neutral one

53
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,250
where r has replaced mu.

54
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,130


55
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,190
So there are two ways that we can get Black-Scholes equations

56
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,050
doing this.

57
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,090
One of them is we can do the integral.

58
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,670
The other way is we can evaluate that expectation

59
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,765
that we wrote down.

60
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:06,000
So the Monte Carlo techniques, which

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,150
we'll see a little bit later, involve

62
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,120
taking that expected value and replacing it

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,140
by an arithmetical average instead of theoretically

64
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,080
computing the weighted average of all possible outcomes

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,120
for all possible price evolutions.

66
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,360
Under this risk-control measure, we'll compute a set of them,

67
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,300
a large number of them, and we'll take an average.

68
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,000
The other way is we just plug in and do some integrals.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,230
That is, we already have the probability density functions,

70
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,750
so let's compute V from the integral formula

71
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,080
that we wrote down.

72
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,820
We can think of V as being an expectation over terminal

73
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,690
values.

74
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,820
But in the end, we just have some integrals to do.

75
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,000
So let's take a look at an example where, for instance,

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,650
we think of a call option with strike price K at time big T,

77
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,780
and we're at time little t currently.

78
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,640
Well, V of St in the present--

79
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,100
that should be a big S--

80
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,580
is going to be the probability density times the terminal

81
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,730
value.

82
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,160
And when we substitute in our definitions

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,410
for our specific payoff that we want,

84
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,010
we get this integral expression here, which we can do.

85
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,019
And we can take x and x prime, which

86
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,720
were logarithmic variables from our original change

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,480
in variables, and change them back and do the integral.

88
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,970
Or to be more explicit, we can write

89
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,500
this formula using our results.

90
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,485
So the full risk-neutral probability distribution

91
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:39,540
when we change back from logarithmic variables

92
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,860
to s where x was log s and we change back,

93
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,040
we have this expression down here

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,300
is just the probability density.

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,470
It looks pretty big and ugly, but that's because

96
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,610
of our changes of variables.

97
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,610
This really is everything that we

98
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,270
began with for the basic probability

99
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,220
density for a set of random walks

100
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,440
with a drift coefficient mu.

101
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,390
Now, this is a Gaussian probability density.

102
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,330
We're going to do a Gaussian integral.

103
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,450
This piece here is the exponential weighting

104
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,340
from the discounted present value.

105
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,840
And then for my payoff function, I'm going to put in S minus K.

106
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,460
And it's easier to do the integral

107
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,470
if we work in exponential variables

108
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,320
and try to have these logarithms inside the integral.

109
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,840
So a change of variables is helpful here.

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,150
We can go from this exact result.

111
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,660
By letting x equal log S, we have this.

112
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,000
Recognize this is in a Gaussian form.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,770
And let's take a look at three features.

114
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,680
The first feature is like in our barrier case,

115
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,260
we have a lower limit of integration.

116
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,260
If the stock price is below K, there's no value,

117
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,670
there's no contribution.

118
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,800
The payoff function is 0.

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,110
If we're above the strike price, there are two.

120
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,850
Terms there's S minus K. So we can do two different intervals.

121
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,710
The second one is easy.

122
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,190
K is just a constant.

123
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,320
It comes outside.

124
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,480
And this is going to give us something in phi.

125
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,870
It's going to give us a cumulative distribution

126
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,870
function because I have just e to the minus x

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,650
squared over 2 in the appropriate units integrated

128
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,000
from something to infinity.

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,500
So that's going to give me something

130
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,770
in phi, where phi, as usual, is defined in this way.

131
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,930
And the other term is not much harder.

132
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,940
Because this is e to the x prime,

133
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,240
I complete the square in the exponent, do the integrals,

134
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,870
and I'll get another function phi.

135
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,900
So the result of plugging this in and changing back

136
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,070
the variables is we get the Black-Scholes solution, S times

137
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,060
phi evaluated at argument I'll call d plus.

138
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,920
In literature, these are often called d1 in d2.

139
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,430
I like to write them as d plus and d minus.

140
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,480
But I have one term in d plus minus the present value

141
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,560
of the strike price Ke to the minus r T minus t times

142
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,340
phi of d minus.

143
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,580
So the definition of d plus and d minus,

144
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,170
they really just come from changing

145
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,420
variables in the integral and looking

146
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,010
at the limits of integration.

147
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,670
In this case, d plus or minus is this first expression

148
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,000
plus or minus 1/2 sigma squared root of T.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,250
And this first expression does have

150
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,480
an interesting interpretation.

151
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,220
So the logarithms are-- because it's

152
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,130
price changes and relative returns on stocks

153
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,190
that matter more than price levels, the ratio

154
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,360
that we see here is the ratio of the stock price

155
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,630
S, the current price, to the present value

156
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,910
of the strike price.

157
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,610
Or we could turn it around and ask about the forward value

158
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,360
of the stock price relative to the strike price, which would

159
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,010
be what we'd see at expiration.

160
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,160
So this numerator is a measure of how far

161
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,500
we are in or out of the money.

162
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,870
If S is larger than the denominator,

163
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,960
the logarithm is going to be the logarithm of a number that's

164
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,130
bigger than 1.

165
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,838
And if it's below, it will be the logarithm

166
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:02,380
of a number that's less than 1, which

167
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,730
will be a negative number.

168
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,080
And it'll be 0 if the function-- not if it's not the money,

169
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,950
not if S is equal to K, but if it's at the money forward

170
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,790
and if that ratio inside the logarithm should vanish.

171
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,980
So that's a measure of how far away

172
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,860
we are from the at the money forward value.

173
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,320
And the denominator, the sigma over square root

174
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,680
of T minus t, that's telling us how far the stock

175
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,330
price, or the log stock price more

176
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,049
precisely would be expected to diffuse given the volatility

177
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:36,500
sigma and the time remaining until expiration.

178
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,000
