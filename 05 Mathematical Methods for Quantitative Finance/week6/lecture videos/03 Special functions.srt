1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,890
PROFESSOR: There are a few functions

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,402
that help summarize some of the results.

3
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:06,360
We won't need these for everything we're doing,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,580
but they are convenient to keep in mind

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,603
and you will see them certainly in the literature.

6
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:13,020
The first thing I'd like you to do

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,420
is take a look at this picture that typically we

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,810
see when representing the payoff for a call option

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,710
at expiration.

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,350
If we have a stock of price S and the strike price

11
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,360
at price K, the price at which the option can be exercised,

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,184
we only exercise if the price is above, say, K is 100,

13
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:36,420
S is $120, that means that we can buy a stock for $100

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,590
and sell it for $120 and our profit would be S minus K.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,180
Or if S is below the strike price,

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,620
we wouldn't exercise it at all.

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,420
That would be a money-losing proposition.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,890
And the value is 0.

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,690
So this is typically shown in a graph

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,030
like this, where it's flat for low values

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,590
and then it increases linearly above.

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,370
We can rewrite that in terms of the absolute value function

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,110
in a simple way, which you can check.

24
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,480
It's 1/2 of the absolute value of S minus K plus S minus K. So

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,820
if S is above K, this doubles.

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,540
And if S is below K the absolute value flips the sign of this

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,070
and we get 0.

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,530
The reason I wrote it that way is if I'd like to take--

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,260
consider taking the derivative of this function,

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,600
it's a lot easier in the absolute value form.

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,400
And if you look at the picture, you can see what we have.

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,220
The left for S below K, the slope is 0, the line is flat.

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,560
For S above K, the slope has line--

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,320
the line has slope 1.

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,770
So the first derivative of that function has a name.

36
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,550
It's called the theta function, or the heavy side function,

37
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,840
or the step function.

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,440
And its equ-- value is equal to 1 if S is bigger than K.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,130
And it's equal to 0 if S is less than K. And the value at 0

40
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,960
depends slightly on how we define it,

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,120
either 0 or sometimes a 1/2.

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,800
We take it as the limiting case.

43
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,980
But in any event away from the point 0,

44
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,250
we see that it has this shape.

45
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,980
What do you think its derivative is?

46
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,850
Well, its derivative is 0.

47
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,360
That is the curve is flat on the left and flat on the right.

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,260
It's flat everywhere except at the origin where

49
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:20,790
the slope changes infinitely in an infinitesimal period of time

50
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,420
or in a 0 point of time.

51
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,000
And, in fact, this defines--

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,490
this-- we can represent something

53
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,500
called the Dirac delta function that

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,550
has the peculiar property that its 0 everywhere except when

55
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,020
its argument vanishes.

56
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,090
There it's equal to infinity.

57
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,460
But the area under its curve, which

58
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,100
is infinitely high and of 0 width, is equal to 1.

59
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,210
Now, it sounds strange.

60
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,240
But, in fact, one way to represent the delta function

61
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,420
is as the limit of our friend, our special solution

62
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,360
to the diffusion equation-- this Gaussian in the limit

63
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,340
where t goes to 0.

64
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,580
Now, we've seen that to get our special solution

65
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,350
and initial conditions that we can

66
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,230
take a limit of an integral-- change

67
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,940
variables inside the integral.

68
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,710
But sometimes we might want to take the limit directly.

69
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,110
And if we want to do so, this delta function notation--

70
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,780
thinking of this as the limit of the Gaussian,

71
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,920
it has these properties where its integral is equal to 1--

72
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,830
gives us a result sometimes more directly.

73
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,840
The properties that the delta function

74
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,340
has that are worth keeping in mind are the following.

75
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,620
We usually don't look at it on its own.

76
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,550
In fact, properly speaking, we can only look at it

77
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,650
in an integral integrated in--

78
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,370
against another function.

79
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,250
So one way that we see it is if I

80
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,120
take delta of x against f of x, gives me f of 0.

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,310
And this is sometimes called a generalized function

82
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,400
or a functional, which is something that takes functions

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,050
and maps them to real numbers.

84
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,640
So, in this case, this takes the function f of x.

85
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,530
And although I've written as an integral,

86
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,870
I get the value at a particular point.

87
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,940
The point is not always 0.

88
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,730
The point is wherever the argument of the delta function

89
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,660
vanishes.

90
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,330
So if it's delta of x minus y times

91
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,850
f of x, that gives me f of y.

92
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,050
And that is also--

93
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,730
gives us a way that you'll sometimes

94
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,030
see for summarizing the rule about the initial conditions

95
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,823
for our integral form of our general solution

96
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,365
to our partial differential equation.

97
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:22,840


98
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,160
If we have inhomogeneous equations where

99
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,020
we have something that doesn't depend

100
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,030
on our variable of interest on the right hand side,

101
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,390
then we can use these functions to generate general solutions

102
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,890
as well.

103
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,320
Although the results are a little bit more complicated,

104
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,580
I've written them down here.

105
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,538
And we're not going to be doing that right now,

106
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:46,290
but you will see them in the same discussions

107
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,230
of partial differential equations that we've had.

108
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,600
So you can know the functions that we're looking

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,065
at, the Green's functions-- this exponential--

110
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:58,920
this special Gaussian exponential form is of general

111
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,490
use and it lets us generate overall time-dependent

112
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,520
solutions where we might have a differential equation with

113
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,420
some, for example--

114
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,780
that doesn't depend on p on the right hand side,

115
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,860
but is some function of z and t on the right hand side.

116
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,480
And if I ask not what function p sets as equal to 0,

117
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,710
but what gives me a solution for an arbitrary h,

118
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,840
then these integral expressions, using my special function here,

119
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,140
let me generate a solution by doing an integral

120
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,730
where I have an arbitrary function h.
