00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,380
PROFESSOR: In looking at probability densities,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,350
we were asking a question about the likelihood

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,990
of finding a random walk or possibly

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,560
the value of financial asset at some time in the future

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,730
under an uncertain set of probability assumptions.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,590
But we don't just need to ask about the value of the stock,

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,780
or the value of an underlying, or the value of a random walk.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,710
We can ask about the value of functions

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,550
of any of those things.

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,800
So we can ask about more general future payoffs.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,590
We can ask about general derivatives.

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,170
How they behave in the future if their function

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,180
say of a random walking stock price.

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,050
And we can compute not only the distributions,

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,150
but some expectations.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,930
What we're going to see is these expectations satisfied

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,090
differential equations.

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,790
And the differential equations are going to be quite familiar.

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,670
So let's go back now to our stock prices.

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,140
If we remember, our standard model

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,710
for a stock diffusion for geometric Brownian motion,

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,930
it's given by this EDO process.

23
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,950
dS is mu Sdt plus sigma SdB.

24
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,670
And we know that by changing to logarithmic variables,

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,890
that the logarithm of S is a random walk with the drift

26
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,090
and a volatility coefficient.

27
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,523
And therefore, it has a probability density.

28
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:29,440
It's going to be a little bit more complicated

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,910
because the logarithms.

30
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,770
But it's an example of the logarithm.

31
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,420
And S is an example of everything

32
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,750
that we've looked at in looking at probability density

33
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,890
functions that vary with time that solve the diffusion

34
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,950
equation.

35
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,750
So when there's a drift term, remember we have an extra part.

36
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,570
The Fokker Planck equation or the backward equation.

37
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,320
And the probability density in logarithmic variables,

38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,720
if we flip them back now to--

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,570
if we go from log variables where

40
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,020
log S represents a random walk back to our original S,

41
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,410
and we create the analogous probability density,

42
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,509
the probability of arriving at ST a time big T given

43
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:14,260
that we started at price at this time T

44
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,660
satisfies a differential equation.

45
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,110
And that differential equation has all the plus sides.

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,540
And it takes this form partial of p with respect

47
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,100
to t plus a familiar pre-factor sigma S squared over 2.

48
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,990
Second partial of p with respect to S

49
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,130
squared plus an unfamiliar term with the mu with the drift

50
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,730
coefficient times S partial of p with respect to S.

51
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,430
It's familiar in our context of random walk probability

52
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,270
densities.

53
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,770
But it's not one that we saw when

54
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,830
we derive the Black-Scholes equation, which you remember

55
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,360
is independent of the value of the drift term mu.

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,450
So here we have in terms of S variables

57
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,600
the differential equations satisfied by the probability

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,215
density or a stock that follows its standard EDO process.

59
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:03,510


60
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,360
Now we can compute some expectation values.

61
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,920
And we do this in the usual way where we take the probability

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,830
weighted average.

63
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,050
So suppose I have some function.

64
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,980
It's a function of S sub T of the terminal values.

65
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,190
And I'd like to compute its expectation at an earlier time

66
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,060
t.

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,870
Well, I compute that by taking my probability density.

68
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,570
I multiply it times the function in question.

69
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,120
I take the probability weighted average.

70
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,890
I integrate over all the values ST. And that's my expectation.

71
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,960
The kind of thing that we have in mind

72
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,400
is going to be something like the payoff on a call option

73
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,040
where big T represents the time when the option expires.

74
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,540
So to compute an expectation, we compute this probability

75
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,720
weighted average.

76
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,300
We do the integral and we're done.

77
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,060
Notice that inside the integral, the coordinates

78
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,860
from the starting point big S and are just S and T

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,720
are constants inside the integral.

80
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,400
They don't do anything they're not integrated against.

81
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,830
So the result is some function of the stock price and time.

82
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,730
So the expected value where we're

83
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,045
computing the expectation of some terminal values at time

84
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:20,298
T is itself a function of the starting point S and T.

85
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,620
And It satisfies the same differential equation as p.

86
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,840
The equation that we wrote down on the previous slide.

87
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,830
So f satisfies a differential equation.

88
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,440
It also has interesting initial conditions.

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,380
In the limit where little t goes to big T,

90
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,610
we think this is arriving at the expected value.

91
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,560
We can go through the same argument

92
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,990
either by looking at the Gaussian form

93
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,690
here, and changing variables in the interval.

94
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,420
Or by using the delta function to say

95
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,530
that when the big T goes to little t,

96
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,300
the probability density approaches delta function.

97
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,900
Either way we do it, we find it satisfies

98
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,450
the initial conditions that this large value when

99
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,590
little t goes to big T takes the expected result.

100
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,030
No pun intended.

101
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,820
f of S because this will be f of S evaluated

102
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,030
at the terminal point S sub t where it's

103
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,640
no longer random because we're evaluating at time big T what

104
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,440
the value will be a time big T.

105
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,300
Let's take things one step further.

106
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,650
Let's think about f and compute its present value.

107
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,690
So the present value is the discounting

108
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,270
under the continuous risk free rate.

109
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,030
It's e the minus RT of some quantity.

110
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,330
That is, we think of the future values

111
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,130
as being what their value would be

112
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,610
if they earned compound interest at a rate r continuously

113
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,890
compounded for a given period of time.

114
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,650
The present value reverses that.

115
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,660
It says let's find out the value now

116
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,940
that would be required to get a given future value.

117
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,220
So I'm going to define V to be the present value of F

118
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,040
where I'm going to multiply it times the usual factor

119
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,360
that we see in finance.

120
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,520
e to the minus r times the amount

121
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,280
of time left to expiration, which in this case

122
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,440
is big T minus little t.

123
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,840
Now what equation does V satisfy?

124
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,080
e to the minus rT times F is just

125
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,200
e minus rT minus t times the expectation.

126
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,100
But remember we saw that f of St is just the terminal

127
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,030
value of our function.

128
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,440
So we can rewrite this as the present value

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,570
of the expectation of V itself evaluated

130
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,920
at the terminal value.

131
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,990
That is to say that V anad S sub t at an initial time

132
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,410
is equal to the discounted present value

133
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,070
of the expectation of the terminal value.

134
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,490
And this expectation, of course, is computed with probability

135
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,570
density p.
