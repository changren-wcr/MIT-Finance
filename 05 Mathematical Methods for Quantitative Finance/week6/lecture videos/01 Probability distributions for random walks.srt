1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,000
PROFESSOR: Ito processes are generalized Brownian motion,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,780
and Brownian motion is a continuous time random walk.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,840
We've looked at how to describe the evolution of a random walk

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,550
in differential and in integral form,

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,880
and now, let's consider an ensemble,

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,090
a whole set of paths and random walks,

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,220
like those you can see behind me.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,670
We start at a particular point, and each of these paths

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,430
is an equally probable realization

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,900
of what might happen.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,880
These are paths simulated on a computer,

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,180
where I have taken the expression for an Ito process,

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,220
discretized it, and in this case,

14
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,400
we can see that, from the same data generating

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,550
process with the same drift rate and volatility,

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,560
some of our paths go up.

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,310
Some of them go down.

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,230
None of them are straight for any period of time.

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,400
But if we think about this as time evolves, as we go from

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,910
left to right, and we think of considering cross sections

21
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,410
at a particular point in time, what does the distribution look

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,010
like?

23
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,830
What is the probability of a random walk

24
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,960
appearing at a given distance from the origin?

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,540
Well, from this picture, we can see a few things.

26
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,910
First, we can see that the outcomes are indeed random,

27
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,590
that whether we're up or down or where

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,630
we are depends on which paths.

29
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,420
So many, many outcomes are possible at any given

30
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,710
point in time.

31
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,100
We also can see that the width of the distribution

32
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,710
grows over time, and there's no surprise.

33
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,635
We know that the variance grows linearly,

34
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:33,010
that the standard deviation grows

35
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,200
with the square root of time, and that

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,100
means that individual random walks tend to diffuse away

37
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,210
from the origin.

38
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,850
The longer time goes on, the greater chance

39
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,790
they have of reaching a larger distance

40
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,570
and the more improbable it is they're found near the origin,

41
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,240
even though the center of the distribution

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,100
remains the most probable place.

43
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,880
So let's think about-- keep this picture in mind,

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,010
of random walks.

45
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,840
We want to think about, for a given

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,240
point in time, what the distribution of outcomes

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,740
that is.

48
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,350
What the probability distribution function is?

49
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,170
What's the likelihood, at a given point in time,

50
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,780
that I end up here versus here versus right

51
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,750
in the thick of things or right down here?

52
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,810
And that, of course, is a function of time,

53
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,570
but typically, we think, of course,

54
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,760
of starting with initial conditions

55
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,950
and letting time evolve forwards.

56
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,900
What we're going to see and take advantage

57
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,540
of is that, for a given initial condition,

58
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,120
we can ask about probabilities of reaching future outcomes.

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,000
The probability distribution functions

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,770
we have, though, will be a function

61
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,930
of the initial starting point, and the fact

62
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,540
that it depends on both endpoints of our walk--

63
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,380
the initial starting point and the uncertain future outcome--

64
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,170
will be helpful for us for solving the Black-Scholes

65
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,790
equation.

66
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,681
So let's start with basics--

67
00:02:56,681 --> 00:03:01,310
give a random variable, mean mu, and variance sigma squared--

68
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,530
which we write in this way.

69
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,950
We say that x is drawn from a normal distribution of mean mu

70
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,450
and variant sigma squared.

71
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,350
We have the familiar Gaussian probability density function.

72
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,740
p of x is a normalization factor, one of our square root

73
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,940
to pi sigma squared.

74
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,270
e to the minus x minus mu quantity squared--

75
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,760
that tells us that the center of the peak

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,650
is when the exponential vanishes,

77
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,280
when x equals mu, divided by 2 sigma squared,

78
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,990
which tells us-- which normalizes the distribution.

79
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,820
Sigma is the width of the distribution,

80
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,560
and that tells us that we can think

81
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,430
about how far we are from the peak in units of sigma.

82
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,010
If our distance from the peak in units of sigma

83
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,380
is the same, when we change sigma,

84
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,190
the probabilities will be identical.

85
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,650
So that's for a single random variable.

86
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,240
Now, a time dependence stochastic process,

87
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,520
x sub t, which we've seen, which we've looked at,

88
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,730
saying Ito process with constant coefficients mu and sigma,

89
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,590
as a generalized arithmetic Brownian motion,

90
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,810
has variants sigma squared t, and its got mean mu t.

91
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,240
That is, the mean grows linearly with time.

92
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,192
The variance grows also linearly with time.

93
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:22,150
So what does that mean?

94
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,730
That means xt, the end point, the distance we've

95
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,910
traveled from the initial point, is a Gaussian distributed

96
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,990
random variable.

97
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,280
That's true for all time scales t, from dt infinitesimal

98
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,290
to macroscopic time scales, and that

99
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,660
means we know what the probability distribution is

100
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,770
for the endpoints.

101
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,340
We know the probability density function is the same as the one

102
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,250
we had before, but where now, it's a function of t,

103
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,590
and we put in t in the appropriate places.

104
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,500
Mu gets replaced by mu t, and sigma

105
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,110
squared get replaced by sigma squared t.

106
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,320
And you can check that this is still appropriately normalized.

107
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,640
But the picture is now quite different.

108
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,395
This is what we saw on the previous slide.

109
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:10,450
The peak of this distribution moves at speed t.

110
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,100
If mu is a positive number, it moves to the right.

111
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,110
If mu is a negative number, it moves to the left,

112
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,160
and I've illustrated that up here behind me.

113
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,430
So this might be the peak at one point.

114
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,470
This is at a point mu t.

115
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,040
And as time goes on, the peak moves to the right.

116
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,670
These are subsequent time steps, and as the distribution

117
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,090
moves to the right, we also see that, with the peak,

118
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,640
sigma squared of t broadens out over time.

119
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,580
So this probability distribution describes a time varying bell

120
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,530
curve, the Gaussian shape.

121
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,520
It moves to the right for positive mu at speed mu,

122
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,190
and it broadens out with time.

123
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,390
That also means that if we're to run time backwards, that as t

124
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,960
gets smaller and approaches 0, that we would be moving

125
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,610
in the opposite direction.

126
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,430
That is, that the peaks get narrower--

127
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,580
the curves get narrower and narrower

128
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,470
and get more and more concentrated

129
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,460
at a central value.

130
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,370
So that's our Gaussian distribution.

131
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,230
We've just applied it in a new way.

132
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,080
We've seen it in many settings, and here's one more.

133
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,200
You can check that this probability distribution

134
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,890
function, p of xt, satisfies a differential equation called

135
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,290
the Fokker-Planck equation, and I've written it here.

136
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,440
Partial derivative with respect to t minus sigma

137
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,670
squared over 2.

138
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,850
Second partial with respect to x plus the mu

139
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,360
dependent term mu, partial of p with respect to x.

140
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,270
And you can check that by taking partial derivatives,

141
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,640
and in fact, each of the partial derivatives

142
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,950
is proportional to p itself because

143
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,810
of the exponential nature here.

144
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,410
And the prefactor doesn't change that, so all of the terms

145
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,300
can be written as proportional to p.

146
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,100
If you take the appropriate partials,

147
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,080
substitute them into the equation,

148
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,700
you'll see that this, in fact, is

149
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,360
a differential equation for that probability density function.

150
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,580
So just to recap--

151
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,950
this probability density function

152
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,400
measures the distribution.

153
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,710
If we do this for a Monte Carlo simulation,

154
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,940
the histogram at a given point in time

155
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,538
would be one of these curves, and it

156
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:22,580
would be an approximation to one of these curves.

157
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,920
And as time goes on, the peaks move out,

158
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,500
but in particular, the curve broadens.

159
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,150
So that was for a random walk that began at the origin

160
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,790
and went to a point xt.

161
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,910
But now, suppose we're specific about starting

162
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,890
at a particular point, x0 t0.

163
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,350
And in this notation, you can read this

164
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,930
as the probability to be at x big T

165
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,960
at time big T given that we started at x0 at time t0.

166
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,550
So it looks a little complicated.

167
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,130
There are for arguments, but the first two

168
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,930
are measuring the probability of being observed

169
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,300
at this point in time, given that we

170
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,860
started deterministically at point x0 and t0.

171
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,790
Now, in this expression, this is just from time and space

172
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,690
translation.

173
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,488
Everything depends on t minus t0 and x minus x0.

174
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:24,530
So this is the same expression that we wrote down

175
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,430
before if you take the special case where x0 equals 0

176
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,650
and where t0 equals 0.

177
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,070
But it's interesting to note that, having written it down,

178
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,880
even though big T and t0 have very

179
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,809
different interpretations--

180
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,570
one is where we observe a random variable.

181
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,640
The other is where we begin our random walk.

182
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,940
But time t0, we know exactly where we are.

183
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,850
The distribution has to be concentrated at x0.

184
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,370
Despite the fact that they have very different meanings,

185
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,420
as a function, we can evaluate p both as a function

186
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,170
of its first two arguments or as a function of its last two

187
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,980
arguments.

188
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,710
And if I think about it as a function of x0

189
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,440
and t0 holding xt and big T fixed,

190
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,930
then I find that it satisfies a different differential

191
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,720
equation called a backward equation,

192
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,820
and it's backward because we're looking

193
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,590
at the wrong point in t.

194
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,560
That is, this is asking a slightly different question.

195
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,100
It's saying, if I wanted to observe the probability

196
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,700
at a particular value at a particular ending point,

197
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,890
how does that depend on where I start?

198
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,840
The probability will change, obviously.

199
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,840
The farther away I am, depending on the distance

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,830
in time or in space, the smaller the probability will be.

201
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,310
So it's a fair question to ask how this function depends

202
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,130
on the two arguments x0 and t0.

203
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,730
Because it's so similar, because everything depends only

204
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,120
on differences, I can replace partial of p

205
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,240
with respect to t by the negative of the partial p

206
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,590
with respect to t0.

207
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,990
And similarly, for the x derivatives, so

208
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,760
this term changes sign.

209
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,020
This term changes sign.

210
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,150
This one would get 2 sign changes

211
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,410
because there are two x0.

212
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,190
So now, where before, we had two relative plus signs and one

213
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,890
minus sign, all three of these signs

214
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,740
are positive in this differential equation.

215
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,290
In this equation, we haven't derived from anywhere else.

216
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,070
All we're saying is, if we plug in this expression,

217
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,130
this Gaussian curve into this differential equation,

218
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,180
that the equation is satisfied.

219
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,000
