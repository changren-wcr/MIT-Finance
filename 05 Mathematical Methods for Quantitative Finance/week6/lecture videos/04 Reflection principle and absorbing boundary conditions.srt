1
00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:02,500
PROFESSOR: We talked about initial conditions

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,410
for the diffusion equation, but more broadly

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,080
differential equations can be formulated

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,210
with boundary conditions that could appear

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,830
at different points in time.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,010
Or they could be conditioned on the spatial variables

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,219
that we have.

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,380
So I'd like to talk about a few examples of boundary problems.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,180
And a couple of tricks that are helpful in their solution.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,640
The first trick that we'll take a look at

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,860
is called the method of images.

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,409
And the idea is that suppose we wanted

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,050
to take a look at the probability of getting

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,240
from point A over here to point B at this end.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,560
If we just wanted to get from point A to point B,

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,650
and we're taking, say random walks

17
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,570
or going up and down by 1 unit, we know how to do that.

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,970
It's just combinatorics.

19
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,150
We count all the ways that we can get all the possible steps

20
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,380
to take us there.

21
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,120
But suppose I had a condition, and I

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,410
say I want you to get from A to B without crossing this line.

23
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,840
So here I've got this is 6.

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,110
I want to get to 8 in a certain number of time steps.

25
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,070
But I want to do it without ever crossing this boundary at 5.

26
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,830
That makes the counting much more complicated.

27
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,010
And in the continuous time case, which we want to get to,

28
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,180
makes it impossible.

29
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,130
How are we going to count the paths?

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,660
Well there are two things that we

31
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,870
can do to get away from counting the work in this case

32
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,600
and they generalize nicely to continuous time.

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,810
The first thing is we'll think about stating things

34
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,280
relative to the boundary.

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,540
We'll think about what it means to hit the boundary.

36
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,940
And the second thing we'll do is we'll

37
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,790
use an artificial construction that

38
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,210
will look at the mirror image of some parts

39
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,203
of our path in the boundary.

40
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:46,870
So let's take a look at this first case.

41
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,060
Suppose that if I want to get from point A

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,890
to point B without hitting C, I imagine that if I hit point C,

43
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,010
I'm dead.

44
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,280
So I want to know what the probability is to get there.

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,977
And we'll call that a survival probability.

46
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:02,560
How do I get from one place to another

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,570
without hitting an intermediate condition?

48
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,370
And it's something we've already talked

49
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,680
about in the context of Gambler's Ruin

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,720
where we hit a boundary and the game is over.

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,360
And we've looked at a number of discrete problems

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,970
where if there's a particular draw down

53
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,970
in a financial balance, then that

54
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,100
affects the outcome in which probabilities

55
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,880
contribute to a final answer.

56
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,970
So here we've got another version of the same thing.

57
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,580
But here's our approach to solving it.

58
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,122
What we're going to do is we're going

59
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:31,090
to say that, first of all, some paths will

60
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,670
go from A to B without ever hitting the boundary.

61
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,470
But there are some that do hit the boundary.

62
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,000
What we could do is instead of just counting the ones that

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,720
don't hit the boundary, we could count them all

64
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,780
and then subtract the ones that hit the boundary.

65
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,050
How do we do that?

66
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,980
Well, the way we can characterize all the paths that

67
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,170
hit the boundary is to notice that if they hit the boundary

68
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,510
one or more than one time, then they definitely

69
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,040
hit it at least once.

70
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,180
What I do is look at this blue path behind me.

71
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,340
What I do is I take a look at the first place where

72
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,400
it hits the boundary.

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,850
So I look at this blue path that starts above.

74
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,770
It hits the boundary here.

75
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,360
Then it goes below and above.

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,980
It hits it a second time.

77
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,420
It bounces around.

78
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,680
And finally it arrives at point B. So what I'm going to do

79
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,500
is I'm going to focus on this first crossing point.

80
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,670
This first place where it touches our barrier.

81
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,430
And around this point, I'm going to draw a mirror image.

82
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,150
And that's this red line.

83
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,420
So you notice that this red line is

84
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,660
this segment of the blue line reflected in the barrier.

85
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,240
So if this is one unit above the barrier,

86
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,720
this starts one unit below the barrier.

87
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,390
Everything after the first passage point

88
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,290
continues the same.

89
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,070
So these paths are in one to one correspondence.

90
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,360
For every path starting at A that gets to B

91
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,510
and hits the boundary, there is exactly

92
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,500
one path that starts at an image point below the boundary

93
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,870
and also finishes at B.

94
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,710
How many such plans are there?

95
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,010
Well that's an easy thing to count

96
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,990
because those are unrestricted.

97
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,570
Because every path where I've done

98
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,899
this reflection trick starts below the barrier.

99
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,000
And they all finish above the barrier.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
They necessarily cross the barrier.

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,090
So the barrier is no restriction in the counting of these paths.

102
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,550
They all cross it if you want for free just

103
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,340
by virtue of where they're starting and endpoints are.

104
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,080
So if I want to compute the barrier,

105
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,910
now I have an easy rule.

106
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,010
I compute the probability to get from A to B unrestricted,

107
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,550
and I subtract the probability to get from the mirror

108
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,940
point, this fictitious point below the boundary, where

109
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,440
I never could be because otherwise I

110
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,550
would already by definition be out of the game.

111
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,230
We would be dead.

112
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,140
But to go from this fictitious point up to here.

113
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,080
And I subtract that probability, and that gives me

114
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,600
the survival probability.

115
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,490
Now this generalizes nicely for continuous time processes.

116
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,050
And it leads us to an interesting way

117
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,730
to think about boundary values for differential equations.

118
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,330
So in terms of our diffusion equation,

119
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,090
suppose we have a barrier at z star.

120
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,140
We start at some point z0 that has to be above z star.

121
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,930
Again, if we're at the barrier or below,

122
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,480
and where our survival probabilities is already

123
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,430
0 like our Gambler's Ruin problem,

124
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,470
the first thing I can do is I can say,

125
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,950
let's look at the unrestricted probability

126
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:42,710
to get from z0 to anywhere in time t.

127
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,590
And while I just measure my distance from z0

128
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,050
and z minus z0 in time t.

129
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,320
And that's given by p0.

130
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,510
I'd like to subtract the mirror image that is the probability

131
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,800
to get from the mirror point, which is 2z star minus z0.

132
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,820
And I want to subtract that probability.

133
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,120
Well, that's just the same p0 function.

134
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,620
p0 of z minus its origin, its starting point,

135
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,410
to z star minus z0, t.

136
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,930
And if I combine those two expressions,

137
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,240
I get this result right--

138
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,260
excuse me.

139
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,540
I get this result right here, which

140
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,180
you will notice is not a probability density.

141
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,140
And it shouldn't be.

142
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,080
It doesn't normalize to 1 because the longer time

143
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,090
goes on, the more chance there is

144
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,550
that we will have hit the boundary the less chance

145
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,470
there is that we will survive.

146
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,690
It certainly should be a positive quantity.

147
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,640
And you can check that it is.

148
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,890
Here's its most interesting property.

149
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,840
It obeys the property that when z is equal to z star,

150
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,860
it vanishes.

151
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,450
The two terms cancel each other out.

152
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,840
That's exactly what should happen.

153
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,040
z equals z star at any point t means

154
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,288
that we're at the boundary where we no longer survive.

155
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,080
So we could have started from the beginning

156
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,020
and said this is our boundary value on the problem.

157
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,200
We are looking for a function ps of z

158
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,890
and t that satisfies the diffusion equation such

159
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,630
that whenever it's evaluated and star any time t,

160
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,010
it's equal to 0.

161
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,310
That's an example of a boundary where in this case

162
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,070
a kind of barrier which we can't cross.

163
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,070
Now of course that solution is only a solution for t

164
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,150
greater than 0.

165
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,880
And it's only a solution above the barrier for z

166
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,440
greater than z star.

167
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,200
You'll notice that this expression here we've

168
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,930
written down doesn't exist for negative times.

169
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,700
That's OK because the square root.

170
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,520
But it does exist for all values of z that

171
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,230
is this expression makes sense.

172
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,750
But it doesn't really solve our differential equation

173
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,950
because if z were below z star, the probability has already

174
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,740
gone to 0, and we wouldn't want to get something negative.

175
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,770
The complete solution to this boundary value problem

176
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:01,830
is that the probability to survive to z and t

177
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,810
is given by 1 over the square root of 2 pi

178
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,300
t times this expression.

179
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,890
Minus the Gaussian exponential with the distance

180
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,580
measured from the image charge.

181
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,530
But if z is below is z star or equal, then the value is 0.

182
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,050


183
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,190
Now this was for a symmetric random walk

184
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,430
where there was no drifter.
