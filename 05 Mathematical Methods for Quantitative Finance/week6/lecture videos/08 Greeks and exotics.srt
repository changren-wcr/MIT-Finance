1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,790
PROFESSOR: Now, it's customary and of incredible practical

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,660
importance for risk management to take a look at a couple

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,170
of related quantities, having solved the Black-Scholes

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,520
equation and found the Black-Scholes formula in puts--

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,239
for calls, which we wrote down in puts,

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,600
which are very similar.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,540
The first thing is the famous delta,

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,460
which we used as part of our hedging argument.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,020
So we know that delta is defined as the partial of V

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,630
with respect to S. Now that we have a closed form

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,420
expression for V, we can take the derivatives,

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,290
and we can compute.

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,920
And we find these values, that the delta for a call

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,410
is phi of d plus, where the argument is

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,420
the previous one that we wrote down,

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,600
phi of minus d plus for a put.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,330
And there's a relationship between the two deltas

18
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,450
for puts and calls that follows from a relationship

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,290
that you'll see in the foundations of finance,

20
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,160
that put-call parity tells us that the value

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,830
of a call minus the value of a put

22
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:05,870
is always equal to the stock price minus the present value

23
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,910
of the strike price.

24
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,160
So if we differentiate this once with respect to S,

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,880
we get the delta of the call minus the delta of the put

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,020
is equal to 1.

27
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,660
If we take two derivatives, we find out

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,340
the gamma, the second derivative of an option value with respect

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,970
to stock price, is the same for both puts and calls.

30
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,430
And the vega is the value of the option with respect to sigma.

31
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,560
And this is a little bit different from the others

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,050
because sigma isn't a dynamical variable.

33
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,320
It's not a variable at all.

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,600
It's just a parameter.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,090
We don't usually think about differentiating with respect

36
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,380
to parameters.

37
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,530
But it is important in thinking about the solution

38
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,530
because it tells us about the sensitivity to changes

39
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,090
and levels of volatility.

40
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,690
If sigma were non-constant, our derivation for Black-Scholes

41
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,950
would not hold, at least not the way we did it.

42
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,780
We'd need to generalize it a bit.

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,810
But if we are holding options, we

44
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,930
might be interested in what would happen to their value

45
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,655
if, say, there were, I don't know,

46
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:12,750
a global pandemic and everyone's understanding of risk change.

47
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,570
And while the volatility is constant,

48
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,450
it jumped to a new level, or it moved a small amount

49
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,350
to a new level.

50
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,250
That would be one reason where it

51
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,440
would be helpful to know what the sensitivity of the value

52
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,880
is with respect to a change in sigma.

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,860
Now, in addition to puts and calls,

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,680
that are vanilla options, our approach

55
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,140
lets us solve for any payoff at all.

56
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,350
Remember, we could put any terminal function

57
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,700
V or any general function f into our equation.

58
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,480
We can have any payout we want at time big T,

59
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,760
and all we need to do is do an integral to get that equation.

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,750
So that's why this is much more powerful than just having

61
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,600
a bunch of formulas that we can look up in a book or online

62
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,140
for different categories for solutions to Black-Scholes.

63
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,410
If you would like to generate a particular payoff,

64
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,498
you know how to do it.

65
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:07,290
Write down what you would like the function

66
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,090
to look like at expiration.

67
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,230
Do the interval.

68
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,020
That will tell you what the value of the option should be.

69
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,000
Here's one example that's even easier

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,070
than doing a put or a call.

71
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,220
It's a binary, or sometimes called the digital option, that

72
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,260
doesn't pay off proportionally.

73
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,220
It's like a bet.

74
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,150
Either it pays off or it doesn't.

75
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,730
So if the strike price finishes above K, you get $1.

76
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,370
If it finishes below, you get nothing.

77
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,020
And if we plug that in the integrand is even easier.

78
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,520
It's either 1 or 0.

79
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,510
The only effect of this is to cut off

80
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,220
the lower limit of integration in S of big T

81
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,140
at the strike price.

82
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,900
And we do the integral, and no surprise,

83
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,530
we end up with a Gaussian cumulative distribution

84
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,360
function phi with an appropriate argument.

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,340
So this is the value.

86
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,260
There's only one term, not two.

87
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,860
And you notice that it is not multiplied times an S or a K

88
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,110
because it doesn't have units of--

89
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,490
scale of the stock price.

90
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,830
It just pays $1 in that limit.

91
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,900
Now, this is directly related to-- because it depends on phi,

92
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,170
and we talked about how we can think about d, it's related,

93
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,357
as you might expect, to the probability

94
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:16,440
of finishing in the money.

95
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,420
After all, a fair bet would be--

96
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,290
would pay off based on what the probability of winning is.

97
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,820
That ought to be what the value is.

98
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,610
But that's not quite what's going on here

99
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,820
because, in fact, the probability distribution

100
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,940
that we're using to compute, the probability distribution

101
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,180
inside our integrals is the risk-neutral distribution.

102
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,820
So even if we knew the return on our underlying mu,

103
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,350
we wouldn't use it.

104
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,330
And this is a little bit counterintuitive.

105
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,540
So the value of the payoff is not

106
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,630
related to the probability of finishing in the money.

107
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,970
It is related to the probability of finishing

108
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,850
in the money under the risk-neutral distribution,

109
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,830
but that could be wildly different

110
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,100
in the real-world probability of finishing in the money.

111
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,000
Why is that?

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,700
Well, our normal gambling intuition

113
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,760
says that we have all these different, uncertain outcomes,

114
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,930
and we start by asking what would be fair.

115
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,560
And the expected value is their typical definition

116
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,610
of what's fair.

117
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,710
But in the case of these options,

118
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,670
where the derivatives and the underlying have the same

119
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,340
stochastic driver-- they're based on related Ito

120
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,390
processes--

121
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,610
we can eliminate risk, as we've seen.

122
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,960
There is no risk at all.

123
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,170
So the value needs to be such that it avoids arbitrage.

124
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,650
If you know the arbitrage value, and someone comes up

125
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,670
with a different value through other arguments that

126
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,280
don't take into account the possibility of eliminating

127
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,160
risk, you've got a great opportunity to make a trade.

128
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,370


129
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,030
Here's another example of an exotic option with no strike

130
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,490
price involved at all, and a different technique

131
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,850
where we don't need to do the same kind of integrals

132
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,370
because we don't have a complicated payoff.

133
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,080
The payoff that we have, in fact,

134
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,990
is-- we're going to assume that the payoff is

135
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,220
as S squared and some appropriate unit.

136
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,520
So let's say that we measure S in dollars,

137
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,140
and at expiration, you get S squared dollars,

138
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,070
whatever that might be.

139
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,170
So how are we going to compute that?

140
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,830
Well, we want to think about what the evolution is

141
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,200
and about what the expectation is,

142
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,230
and we want to apply our result that the value of an option

143
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,520
is the discounted present value of the expectation

144
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,080
of the terminal value under the risk-neutral measure.

145
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,380
So let's take those words and those formulas for expectations

146
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,760
and put them into play.

147
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,780
And what we see is, first of all,

148
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,410
that log X is just twice as log S.

149
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,820
We know that log S is a Brownian motion-- an arithmetic,

150
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,640
not a lognormal Brownian motion, because we've taken logarithm.

151
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,130
So we know what d of log S is.

152
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,150
And d of log X is just twice d of log S.

153
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,530
So that means that a time t, where we can let t be zero,

154
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,030
it's going to be the initial value

155
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,800
S squared times e to twice mu minus sigma

156
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,590
squared over 2 times t plus--

157
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,470
because it's a random walk, because log S is a random walk

158
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,510
and log X is some random walk, we're

159
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,240
going to represent this as plus sigma squared

160
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,500
root of t times Z.

161
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,440
So here's my 2, and going from X--

162
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,480
excuse me, going from S to X, this

163
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,780
is what we normally would have gotten by integrating our log

164
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,300
S. And because it's a square, we just

165
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,340
end up with the factor of 2.

166
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,360
Going to the risk-neutral measure means that we take mu,

167
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,950
and we just replace it by r.

168
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,080
That's our heuristic, and it really works.

169
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,130
So we take mu, we replace it by r,

170
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,640
and then we need to compute the expectation with respect

171
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,550
to the Gaussian probability distribution.

172
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,270
Again, what I've called Q-measure means don't use mu.

173
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,040
Where you see mu, write r.

174
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,120
So we'd like to do some Gaussian integrals of this expression,

175
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,150
where we replace u by r.

176
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,390
And then we recognize Z as being a Gaussian variable.

177
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,760
We do the expectations, and what we're

178
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,690
left with is an expression with r minus sigma squared over

179
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,110
2 times T e to the 2 sigma squared T,

180
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,110
and then when we take its discounted present value

181
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,590
e to the minus rT, we get this final result,

182
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,110
that the value of the option is going to be

183
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,980
the current value squared.

184
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,799
And let's let T be the--

185
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,809
so we're at time T equals zero right now times e

186
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:47,720
to the rT plus sigma squared T.
