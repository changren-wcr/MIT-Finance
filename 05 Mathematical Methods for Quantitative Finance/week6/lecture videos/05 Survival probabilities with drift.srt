00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520


1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,350
PROFESSOR: If there is a drift term,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,870
then things change, and we can't really

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,119
use our symmetry argument.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,160
We can't use the method of images.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,350
And in fact, in our discrete case,

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,130
if our up and down probabilities were different,

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,880
that argument wouldn't have worked at all.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,093
We could count the paths the same way,

9
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:21,260
but the weighting factors would have been different.

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,270
And we would have needed to adjust the weighting part,

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,140
even though the combinatorics would have been the same.

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,130
But we don't need to go that far to tweak our solution

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,868
to get a correct value.

14
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:34,410
And we'll do what we did in two ways.

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,130
The first thing is to notice that our boundary condition is

16
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,010
the same.

17
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,640
We want to have that the probabilities should

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,370
vanish whenever it z is equal to z star.

19
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,420
That's just the nature of the boundary.

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,150
So that's OK.

21
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,360
We know that if we have a linear combination of two

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,660
solutions to the diffusion equation, by linearity

23
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,260
it's also a solution.

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,570
So let's not toss our solutions away.

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,620
Let's see if maybe instead of just taking the difference,

26
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,200
if a different weighted average of the two

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,769
might be able to work.

28
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,580
So what we're going to do is we're going to make a guess.

29
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,590
We'll put in a particular form.

30
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,690
We'll see what would be required by that form.

31
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,190
And then we'll see if we can come up

32
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,790
with a general solution.

33
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,880
So the form I'm going to try is I'm

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,280
going to suppose that all I need to do

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,210
is multiply by some constant C. And the constant C would

36
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,760
be equal to 1 if mu were equal to 0,

37
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,962
but I don't know what it is.

38
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,670
It's going to be some function of mu that

39
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,040
vanishes when-- or that goes to 1 when mu is equal to 0.

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,980
So it certainly satisfies the differential equation.

41
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,910
That's great.

42
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,130
What happens when z equals z star?

43
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,630
Well, I want to set it equal to 0.

44
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,050
So if I put in that condition, and I

45
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,580
require that this expression be equal to 0 and z equal z star,

46
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,410
I can solve for C. OK.

47
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,180
Just by dividing, I have this expression

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,280
in parentheses is equal to 0.

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,910
That means I have the ratio of these two exponentials.

50
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,240
And I find that C is equal to e to the minus 2

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,180
mu z0 minus z star over sigma squared.

52
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,990
So if mu is equal to 0, it checks the condition

53
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,860
that we needed.

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,420
C is equal to 1.

55
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,180
So this satisfies our differential equation

56
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,310
because it's the difference of solutions,

57
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,830
and it satisfies our boundary conditions

58
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,680
because, by construction, when z is equal to z star,

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,190
the function vanishes, the two terms cancel each other out.

60
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,950
Now, suppose we want to know our survival probability at a given

61
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,240
point in time, that is, not to get to a particular terminal

62
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,110
point z, but to finish anywhere above the boundary.

63
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,410
Well, I have the probability density.

64
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,330
ps of z and t dz tells me the probability in time t

65
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,950
that I'll have reached some point between z and z plus dz.

66
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,180
Let's integrate it over all z, but only those z's that

67
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,230
are above the boundary.

68
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,120
Well, our integrand is going to be a Gaussian type exponential

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,280
with a Gaussian prefactor, and with some cut off

70
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,915
on the integral.

71
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:15,790
And that means that we can express everything

72
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,420
in terms of a cumulative distribution function

73
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,440
from the Gaussian.

74
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,960
And I'm going to note that by the function phi.

75
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,330
And it shows up all over the place.

76
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,160
Whenever we're dealing with Gaussians,

77
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,580
phi is defined to be the definite integral from

78
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:36,175
minus infinity to x of the Gaussian kernel 1

79
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,550
over square root of 2 pi e to the minus x squared over 2.

80
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,700
So I'm integrating, but only up to x.

81
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,480
It has a nice symmetry property for phi of minus x.

82
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,300
And you can get that to change the limits of integration.

83
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,910
And the result that we get when we do the integral is I

84
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,330
get two terms, both in phi.

85
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,520
I have phi here with this argument.

86
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,040
And I have another phi here with a different argument.

87
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,720
And I have a little exponential prefactor.

88
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,690
So this is my solution.

89
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,660
You notice that it depends on time.

90
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,423
It depends on my starting point.

91
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:11,590
It depends, in fact, not just on the starting point,

92
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,320
but it depends on z0 minus z.

93
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,700
That is, it depends on how far away I am from the barrier

94
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,019
initially.

95
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,710
If mu is a positive number, then on average--

96
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,990
or a negative number, actually, for that matter--

97
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,330
then this thing in the numerator is, on average,

98
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,740
how far I expect what my expected location is,

99
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,510
how far away am I going to be.

100
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,417
If mu is big, then this increases over time,

101
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,250
and it means I'm getting farther and farther

102
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,560
away from the barrier.

103
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,290
And this denominator square root of sigma

104
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,110
squared t gives me a measure as to how much diffusion

105
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,910
I typically would expect in time t.

106
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,940


107
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,790
Now, let's think of places where we might apply this.

108
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,610


109
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,200
Suppose we want to think about the probability of default

110
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,940
or a firm.

111
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,430
And the default could be that the firm runs out of money

112
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,560
and that the equity goes to 0, or it could be a trigger point.

113
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
There could be some particular financial term

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,780
that's a covenant in a bond, let's say.

115
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,220
But let's keep things simple.

116
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,120
Let's picture a firm that's represented by debt and equity.

117
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,310
So its resources our D plus E. That's the value of the firm.

118
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,750
z, we'll that be the firm value.

119
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,110
We'll let z star be the case when the equity goes to 0, when

120
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,150
the shareholders are wiped out, and we're

121
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,910
on the borderline where the value of the firm

122
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,160
might be less than the outstanding debt that's owned.

123
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,540
So that's z star.

124
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,160
Certainly, we don't want the value

125
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
of our firm to go below z star.

126
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,280
What's the probability of that happening?

127
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,490
Well, let's start with the current value

128
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,310
z0 to be the firm value, and let's assume that we've

129
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,020
got some positive equity.

130
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,970
Then we know how to solve the problem.

131
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,940
That's the survival probability that we just computed.

132
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,980
It says, in a given amount of time,

133
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,623
what's the probability that you don't default?

134
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:02,040
And that's-- now we can think about what that's a function

135
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,540
of.

136
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,030
Well, it depends on the rate of growth of the firm, mu.

137
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,580
It depends on the capital reserves, on z0 minus z star.

138
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,470
That's how much initial capital we have.

139
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,340
So by having a good capital buffer--

140
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,720
and you can check this--

141
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,940
the larger the capital buffer is,

142
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,800
the higher the survival probability

143
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,860
is, which certainly makes sense.

144
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,360
But we could turn this around and think of this as something

145
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,440
to solve for.

146
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,080
If you're raising money for your startup,

147
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,690
instead of just seeing how much money you can get,

148
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,120
or who's offering you the best terms,

149
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,450
or what might be the return that they're demanding,

150
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,390
you might ask a very personal question close

151
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,360
to the heart, which is, what are the chances of my business

152
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,530
surviving?

153
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,240
How does it depend on the capital?

154
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,420
And if I want to minimize my default probability,

155
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,970
if I want to minimize my extinction

156
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,180
probability for a business, how much capital do I need?

157
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,990
That is, we can solve what the capital resources are

158
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,710
to achieve a particular probability level for default.

159
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,040
We can also think about two different things

160
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,390
that both contribute.

161
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,030
One of them is how much initial capital we have,

162
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,700
and the other is what the rate of growth of the firm is.

163
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,523
Obviously, for a slow growth rate,

164
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,940
we're going to be mostly dependent

165
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,260
on the initial buffer.

166
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,600
If it's expected to have a high growth rate,

167
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,950
then that might not be as important.

168
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,080
This also shows up in a slightly different version in a number

169
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,580
of insurance problems.

170
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,380
We have some capital base.

171
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,440
We have a possibility of claim premiums

172
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,270
that, usually, we would model is a jump process,

173
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,790
not a diffusion process.

174
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,272
But we do need to balance that against the rate of growth,

175
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:44,730
the rate of income through premiums

176
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,105
that might be needed, ultimately,

177
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:49,320
to offset negative fluctuations that would show up.

178
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,700
So we can think about this as representing real events

179
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,590
for things that might happen, represented

180
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,530
by a boundary, the likelihood of a particular event.

181
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,780
And it's not something we can formulate in advance,

182
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,120
and saying this happens at a particular time,

183
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,000
so this could have happened anywhere.

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,130
And this helps us answer the question,

185
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,200
a somewhat path-dependent question,

186
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,570
without getting into the paths.

187
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,970
What's the probability to get from A to B

188
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,680
without hitting some event, in this case a barrier,

189
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,090
along the way?

190
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,960
Here's a numerical example of this problem you can find

191
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,480
worked out in detail in the book Fixed Income Finance

192
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,220
by Wise and Bhansali.

193
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,169
And they take the example where mu is 1%, sigma is 25%,

194
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,230
and the z0 minus z is a half.

195
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,610
And we can see how the survival probability evolves over time.

196
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,500
And, as we would expect, the longer we wait,

197
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,370
the more it goes down because you have more and more chances

198
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,990
for something bad to happen.

199
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,990
And we can see that we have this initial behavior here,

200
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,370
and then it drops off over time.

201
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,000
And here we look at the point where it reaches 50%.

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,280
At the end of 10 years, you can go back

203
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,370
and rerun the numbers using that closed form expression

204
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,590
to see how things behave with the different growth rate.

205
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,930
How does that change the survival probabilities?

206
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,070
How does that compare to changing the initial capital

207
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,620
buffer?
