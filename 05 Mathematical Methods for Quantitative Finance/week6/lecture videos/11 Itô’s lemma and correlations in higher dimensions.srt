PROFESSOR: The generalization of Ito's lemma

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,850
to multiple variables is straightforward.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,150
And we won't go through the same derivation here.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,890
We'd just like to tell you the result

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,900
and show you a couple examples.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,980
If we have multiple variables X, then we

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,950
can imagine that each of them is an Ito process,

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,070
with the difference that the coefficient functions could

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,210
depend on any of the other variables.

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,110
So the generalization is that I let

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,860
i run from 1 through, say, n.

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,840
And for each dXi, each of the coefficient functions ai or bi

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,740
can depend on time, plus all of the other X's.

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,750
Now, this is dt.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,520
There's only a single time.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,280
But I'm introducing a Brownian motion

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,690
dBi for each possible process.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,670
Now, some applications of this are

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,590
where we might have multiple assets,

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,280
like a whole bunch of stocks in a portfolio or in an index.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,300
We might have a factor model where

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,879
we try to describe the market in terms

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,380
of a small number of factors.

24
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,200
If it were the capital asset pricing model, or CAPM,

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,260
we might try to describe many stocks in terms

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,360
of a single stochastic driver.

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,180
If it were a factor model, we might

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,820
try to describe the covariant structure observed

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,300
among multiple stocks with a small number of factors

30
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,100
and have a covariance matrix that's

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,290
perhaps of less than full rank.

32
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,380
So all those cases would be examples where we

33
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,840
would have multiple variables.

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
And when we have multiple variables,

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,150
the only thing we need to be concerned about

36
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,310
is the possibility that they might be correlated.

37
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,870
So the first terms in our multidimensional Ito's lemma

38
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,830
are the same that we saw before.

39
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,730
We have partial of F with respect to dt.

40
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,520
For each of the X's, we have an independent term,

41
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,710
partial of F with respect to X times dX,

42
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,240
which is its own Ito process for X1, X2, X3.

43
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,535
And the diagonal terms here when i is equal to j,

44
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:09,740
row ij, the correlation between i and j is equal to 1.

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,930
And this gives us our usual Ito term.

46
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,300
But there are a whole lot of extra terms

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,270
that can arise if the Brownian motions are

48
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,050
correlated with each other.

49
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,720
And there's a simple heuristic which

50
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,220
generalizes what we did before.

51
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,570
So in the diagonal cases, dB squared,

52
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,030
dBi squared, dB1 squared, or dB2 2

53
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,210
squared, and so on gets replaced by a dt.

54
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,970
In dX1 squared, it's replaced by b1 squared dt, same as we

55
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,250
had before, ordinary Ito.

56
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,320
But if b1 and b2 have correlation rho 12,

57
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,920
then the product of these two differentials

58
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,610
is going to be, in probability, equivalent

59
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,120
to replacing it by row ij dt.

60
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,430
So that gives us this full term, where

61
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,970
what used to be a single second partial derivative with respect

62
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,550
to X is now replaced by a matrix of second partial derivatives

63
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,010
where they're multiplied times the correlation

64
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:16,600
coefficients times the b factors for each of those weights.

65
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,840
For example, suppose I've got two stochastic variables

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,650
and I have F as their product X1 X2.

67
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,410
I apply Ito's lemma, and I see that I get X1 dX2 plus X2

68
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,670
dX1 plus dX1 times dX2.

69
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,420
And I haven't yet said what either of those Ito processes

70
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,380
are for X1 or X2, but we already can

71
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,930
simplify by dividing through by F in this case.

72
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,570
So if I divide through by X1 X2, I get a very simple form.

73
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:57,170
dF over F is dX1 over X1 plus dX2 over X2 plus their product.

74
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,040
Now, suppose we apply that for a specific case.

75
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,050
Say we have geometric Brownian motion,

76
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,770
so suppose for X1 and X2 that both of them have dXi over Xi

77
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,870
is an individual mu dt plus an individualized sigma dB,

78
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,690
then I would have the dF over F is

79
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,220
going to be mu 1 plus mu 2, the sum of the drift rates,

80
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,490
plus an Ito term plus two Brownian terms, sigma 1, sigma

81
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,270
2.

82
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,750
If rho 12 goes to 0, this ends up just

83
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,780
being the sum the two Ito processes directly.

84
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,460


85
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,630
Suppose we take the ratio, so I take X1 over X2.

86
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,320
Well, if we go through and apply the same rules

87
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,940
and divide through by F, we find a somewhat more complicated

88
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,570
expression.

89
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,118
Ratios are a little bit harder to differentiate, so that's OK.

90
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:55,910
But let's take a look at this special case,

91
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,827
and we'll see a little bit of a paradox that's

92
00:04:57,827 --> 00:04:59,810
here that you can think about.

93
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,180
If the coefficient in rho 12 is zero,

94
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,520
so the two processes are uncorrelated,

95
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,338
then we have this expression.

96
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:12,380
We don't need to worry about the minus sign here.

97
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,755
You might be a little bit worried

98
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:16,760
that there's a minus sign in front of the drift term,

99
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,100
but remember, it depends only on sigma squared,

100
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,740
so the minus sign makes no difference.

101
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,280
It's not as though there is risk canceling out between these two

102
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,100
in the event where they're uncorrelated.

103
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,070
On the other hand, suppose mu 1 equals mu 2,

104
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,360
the drift rates are equal.

105
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,390
This term is strictly positive.

106
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:41,852
It depends on sigma 1 squared as the asset in the Ito

107
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:45,350
process, the stochastic process, in the denominator divided

108
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,740
by X1 squared.

109
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,910
So in the event the mu 1 equals mu 2,

110
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,280
these terms vanish, the coefficient is positive,

111
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
and we have a positive drift term.

112
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,490
Now, the question is, how could that be the case?

113
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,750
Because if I applied this to X1 over X2

114
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,700
and I let F measure the growth rate of X1 relative to X2,

115
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,220
how can that be positive at the same time

116
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,820
that the growth rate of X2 relative to X1

117
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,330
is also positive?

118
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,115
