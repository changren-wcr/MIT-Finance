0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520


1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,270
PROFESSOR: Now special case, if we let mu equal 0,

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,430
then that last term drops out.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,570
If we let sigma equals 1, the three factor sigma

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,110
squared over 2 just becomes 1/2, and we

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,150
get the diffusion equation that we've already seen.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,440
So the diffusion equation in its standardized form

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,243
is partial of p0, we'll call it.

8
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:25,910
We'll be thinking of a particular thing.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,600
But in a general case, partial of p with respect to t

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,440
is 1/2 second partial of p with respect to z.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,150
And there are no other constants here

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,710
just because I've set them to particular values.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,410
Now this partial differential equation

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,260
has a lot of solutions.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,010
But there's one that's very, very special,

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,285
and that's the standardized Gaussian.

17
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:52,210
p0 of z and t is equal to 1 over square root of t e to the minus

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,850
z squared over 2t.

19
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,310
And we'll see that the reason that this is special

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,090
is it will let us generate other solutions that

21
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,010
are of particular interest for finance

22
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,010
to the diffusion equation and some related equations.

23
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,560
But just taking it on its face, first

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,270
does it satisfy the equation?

25
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,350
Yep, it does.

26
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,170
It's special case, mu equals 0, sigma equals 1.

27
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,713
Take the partials, plug it in, try it out.

28
00:01:16,713 --> 00:01:18,880
If you're stuck on the other one, do this one first.

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,940
It's a little bit easier.

30
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,550
There are fewer terms.

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,030
But this is just a special case.

32
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,940
So it satisfies the equation.

33
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,460
Second, how do we visualize it?

34
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,740
Well, this is a symmetric random walk.

35
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,660
The up and down probabilities are equal.

36
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,560
Mu is equal to 0, so it stays centered around the origin.

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,180
And as time goes on, the width still increases

38
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,590
and the curves get--

39
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,770
the peak gets lower and lower and the curves

40
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,870
get broader and broader over time.

41
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,620
If we run time backwards, as we go from large time

42
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,530
and approach t equals 0 from above, then

43
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,470
what we see is the peaks converge on the origin,

44
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,060
get narrower and narrower.

45
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,920
Because they're probability distributions, of course,

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,610
the area under the curve is always equal to 1.

47
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,580
Do note that this is only a solution to our equation

48
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,789
for positive values of t because we have this square root here,

49
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,090
and that would take us into the complex numbers, which

50
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,700
would be difficult to interpret as a probability.

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,920
So this is a special equation that

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,650
can be thought of as being concentrated

53
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,670
at the origin as t approaches 0 from above as we

54
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,830
run the clock backwards.

55
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,320
Now, this special solution can be used

56
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,100
to obtain the general solution.

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,550
I'd like to show you the formula,

58
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,870
and then we'll take a look at why it works.

59
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,780
So here's the formula.

60
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,740
If we've got some initial conditions, so at time 0,

61
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,810
we want a function p that at time 0 has some shape,

62
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,840
any shape you'd like.

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,120
Well, it can't be any shape.

64
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,690
It needs to be integrable.

65
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,130
So it needs to be somewhat reasonable, not grow too fast,

66
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,100
not have too many [? angularities ?]

67
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,330
or discontinuities.

68
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,030
But let's call that general function f.

69
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,300
So I'd like to have the solution to the diffusion equation

70
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,650
that, in addition, a t equals zero takes on a specified form.

71
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,710
And the answer to that, the general solution,

72
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,290
is to take our previous expression,

73
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,960
our special p0, our special Gaussian,

74
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,390
replace z by z minus w, multiply it times f of w,

75
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,460
and integrate over w.

76
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,150
And that's it.

77
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,510
So concretely, it's exactly this expression.

78
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,310
It's just a Gaussian integral.

79
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,480
You pick an f.

80
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,320
You plug it in.

81
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,490
You do an integration.

82
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,710
You get an expression.

83
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,975
And you can check by direct inspection

84
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:41,400
that it satisfies the equation.

85
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,600
For example, if you take f of z is z squared,

86
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,930
and you do this integral, you put in z squared,

87
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,870
make some changes of variables, you do the integral,

88
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,380
it's an ordinary Gaussian integral, definite integral,

89
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,390
from minus infinity to infinity, you

90
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,130
get the result because it's a function

91
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,960
that we integrate over w.

92
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,420
But the result is a function of z and t.

93
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,510
You get the answer z squared plus t.

94
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,500
And when t is equal to 0, we recover--

95
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,550
we recover the p of z and t at t equals 0 is z squared.

96
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,740
And it satisfies the differential equation,

97
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,329
as you can check.

98
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,750
How does it work?

99
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,110
Well, we need to do two things, check

100
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,390
that it satisfies the differential equation,

101
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,563
check that it satisfies the initial conditions.

102
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:28,980
The way that we check that it intensifies the differential

103
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,470
equation is to differentiate it, that is,

104
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,380
we take the differential operator of our diffusion

105
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,930
equation-- these operators-- which are linear operators,

106
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,537
and when they act on the function p of z,

107
00:04:40,537 --> 00:04:44,670
t, we can move-- p of z, t is defined by an integral,

108
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,430
but the integral, of course, can be thought of as a sum.

109
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,610
It's a linear set of pieces for its arguments.

110
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,350
And if the integral is convergent,

111
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,270
I can move the differential operator

112
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,440
under the integral sign, where, because it depends on t and z,

113
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,420
it only acts on p0.

114
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,340
Everything else depends only on w.

115
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,900
And there no double w's in the differential operator.

116
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,060
So the differential operator in square brackets acts on p0,

117
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,230
and it gives 0.

118
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,990
So 0 times f of w is 0.

119
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,250
Integrating 0 minus infinity to infinity gives 0 again.

120
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,480
It satisfies the differential equation for any f.

121
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,430
This expression will work.

122
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,200
But does it satisfy the initial conditions?

123
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,260
So what we'd like to look at is what's

124
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,020
the limit as t goes to 0 from above

125
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,110
of that integral expression that we've seen,

126
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,970
that we've written down right here.

127
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,850
Well, we take the limit as t goes to 0 of our expression,

128
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,420
and we can substitute variables under the integral

129
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,890
if we define u to be w minus z over square root of t.

130
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,550
Then that takes out the z and the t dependents.

131
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,060
This becomes e to the minus u squared over 2.

132
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,360
The square root of t that we have here,

133
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,260
dw over square root of t, is going to be du.

134
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,130
So that's over here.

135
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,280
So the square root of t went away.

136
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,760
And the argument in f of w now gets shifted--

137
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,170
it becomes f of z--

138
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,540
plus u times square root of t.

139
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,730
If we're away from any singular points

140
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,370
in the function or discontinuities, then

141
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,610
as t goes to 0, this term vanishes.

142
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,870
I'm left with f of z, which is a constant with respect to u.

143
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,450
And the remaining integral is equal to 1.

144
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,530
It's a Gaussian interval.

145
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,550
It's normalized.

146
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,210
And I get f of z, which is the appropriate initial condition.
