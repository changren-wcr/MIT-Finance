00:00:00,898 --> 00:00:02,940
PROFESSOR: Another example of boundary conditions

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,890
in our differential equations is looking

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,350
at the exercise conditions.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,060
More American options.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,030
The European option is an option that

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,320
can only be exercised at its expiration date.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,260
An American option is one that can

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,640
be exercised at the discretion of the holder

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,450
of a long position.

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,420
The option any time up until exercise.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,439
So the owner has to choose whether or not

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,940
to exercise early.

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,690
And if to exercise when or under what conditions.

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,060
And we can't apply our previous formulas really held

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,880
for European exercise because those

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,260
covered the entire domain.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,780
But once an option holder exercises his or her option,

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,490
that option is no longer there.

19
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,020
And the solution would no longer be valid.

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,320
So we have a different kind of boundary condition.

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,920
Now this is actually a fairly complicated subject.

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,710
We're going to look at one very, very special example.

23
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,180
And that's going to be to consider

24
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,160
an option that never expires.

25
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,390
And we'll consider a put option.

26
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,550
So the put option is something that pays off

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,170
if the value goes down.

28
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,630
If value is below the strike price.

29
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,340
And the amount that it pays off is

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,980
equal to the amount by which is below the strike price.

31
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,340
Basically, the put option gives you the right, but not

32
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,200
the obligation to sell at price K.

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,740
So you would never do that if the price were above K.

34
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,430
You would sell at the market price.

35
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,910
But if the price drops low, then you

36
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,790
might choose to exercise and sell at K.

37
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,110
If the price goes to 0, obviously you

38
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,480
might as well exercise it early because that's

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,850
the maximum amount of money you can get.

40
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,370
The stock price never can go below 0.

41
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,250
The maximum value you can ever get is K.

42
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,210
So if the price were to hit 0, you would certainly exercise.

43
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,100
But it might be the case and if the price

44
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,590
gets sufficiently low, you would exercise as well.

45
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,200
So let's see if that might be the case.

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,259
The interesting thing about the perpetual option

47
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,380
is because it never expires the value is time independent.

48
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,770
So this is a way to get an equation that's

49
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,110
simpler than the partial differential equations.

50
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,700
It's going to be an ordinary differential equation.

51
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,970
So the value can only depend on the stock price.

52
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,840
It doesn't matter if it's been bouncing around for an hour

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
or for a year.

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,470
The value only depends on what the current stock

55
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,180
price is because the time never ever enters into the problem.

56
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,530
So the equation we have is very simplified Black-Scholes

57
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,290
where V depends only on S. And we drop the time derivative.

58
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,470
So this is the equation that we have

59
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:50,380
that's for any time independent contract that satisfies

60
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,060
the Black-Scholes equation.

61
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,090
Now this equation in order to solve it,

62
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,710
we're going to try a particular form.

63
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,800
We're going to look for an inspired guess.

64
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
See if we get lucky.

65
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,870
See if it might work.

66
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,660
And if it does, what conditions are

67
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,380
there so that we can get any arbitrary parameters exactly

68
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:08,980
right.

69
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,760
So the guess that we're going to try here is to try a power law.

70
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,620
And the motivation for that guess

71
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,210
is to notice this is homogeneous in its weight in S.

72
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,090
This doesn't have any S this is just a V. This

73
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,470
has an S in the numerator.

74
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,003
One in the denominator.

75
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,170
This has 2 in the numerator.

76
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,650
2 in the denominator.

77
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,900
So let's see what happens.

78
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,640
If I take V of S as S to some power,

79
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,520
if I differentiate it I'm going to get s to the alpha--

80
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,040
I'm going to get alpha S to the alpha minus 1.

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,210
I multiply by S. And now I've got S to the alpha again.

82
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,310
If I take two derivatives, I'm going

83
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,370
to end up with something-- or actually specifically alpha

84
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,810
times alpha minus 1.

85
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,540
S to the alpha minus 2.

86
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,470
I multiply S squared, I'm going to get us to the alpha again.

87
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,430
So if I do that, I divide through by S to the alpha.

88
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,270
I get an equation or alpha for these coefficients

89
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,810
that come from these equations.

90
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,210
And then it's a quadratic equation in alpha.

91
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,870
So I solve the quadratic equation.

92
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,000
And I find there are two possible values.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,650
a equals 1 or minus 2r over sigma squared.

94
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,899
Now a equals 1 would have been easy to guess.

95
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,210
a equals 1 says that the value is S.

96
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,180
And the stock price itself always satisfies

97
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,740
the Black-Scholes equation.

98
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,470
But we also know that that can't be part of the solution

99
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,470
because it grows as S grows to infinity.

100
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,350
And the value of a put should be a decreasing function

101
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,500
in the stock price.

102
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,448
So that can't be part of the solution.

103
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:39,490
What about the other one?

104
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,880
Well, assuming that interest rates are positive,

105
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,280
and volatility of course, is positive we're

106
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,070
going to get S to the minus 2r over sigma squared.

107
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,160
So our solution has to be something of this form.

108
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,640
There's a overall proportionality constant.

109
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,020
But the S dependence has to be power law in S decreasing.

110
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,300
And that will satisfy this differential equation.

111
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,260


112
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,310
We might choose to exercise the price is sufficiently low.

113
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,550
And when we exercise, the value of the option

114
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,800
will be equal to its exercise price.

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,370
Because otherwise there would be an arbitrage opportunity value

116
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,360
where higher or lower.

117
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,200
Though at the exercise point, we have

118
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,860
that whatever it is S hat, that the value of the option

119
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,050
is going to be K minus S hat.

120
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,680
And that lets us rewrite our form in terms of we've

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,530
just traded one unknown for another unknown.

122
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,880
In this case S hat.

123
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,410
Now the way that we can think about the value

124
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,260
is that the person holding the long position

125
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,630
who has the choice as to whether to exercise

126
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,980
or not might choose to maximize his or her value.

127
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,750
The person with the short position

128
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,460
has to assume that because that's sort of the worst case.

129
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,350
If the person who holds the option

130
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,590
doesn't take advantage of an exploration opportunity,

131
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,190
that's good.

132
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,312
That's extra value.

133
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:05,770
But that isn't something that you'd

134
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,810
want to count on if you were managing risk,

135
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,070
and you were in the business of writing options.

136
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,500
So let's assume that the option holder will try

137
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,990
to optimize maximize its value.

138
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,680
And we can compute by differentiating with respect

139
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,930
to this parameter that's a choice.

140
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,030
This S hat.

141
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,610
And see what maximizes the value.

142
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,330
And then that will pin down what our final value for the option

143
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:31,960
is.

144
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,300
So the first part of this is something that

145
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,190
showed up on a problem set.

146
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,500
This part completes the problem.

147
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,055
You can try it out first before you look at these formulas.

148
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:43,930
But otherwise, if you're looking at them now,

149
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,510
and you want to see how it goes to finish things up,

150
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,070
we see that the first partial setting it to 0

151
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,290
gives us the solution for S hat.

152
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,960
We can check that this is a maximum and not a minimum

153
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,760
by looking at second derivatives.

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,700
And then if we substitute S hat into the expression

155
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,140
above, we finally get this result for the value

156
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,000
of the American option in terms of S and K.

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,790
The parameters sigma and r.

158
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,550
And obviously time doesn't appear in the problem.
