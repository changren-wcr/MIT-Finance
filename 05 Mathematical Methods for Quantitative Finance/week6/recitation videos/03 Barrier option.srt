00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,450


1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,850
Here's an exercise for a barrier option

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,180
that involves solving a differential equation using

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,460
the method of images, or reflection,

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,360
and the notion of trying to make an inspired guess for a trial

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,170
function.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,400
Let's see if we can put it all together.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,590
So here's the problem.

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,460
The problem is to find the value the European down-and-out call

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,540
option.

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,320
And this is an example that was given in Robert Martin's

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,050
original paper on option pricing that came out at the same time

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,730
as Black and Scholes, and he gave

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,010
this example of this option.

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,630
So it has a strike price K, it has time to expiration T,

15
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,910
it satisfies geometric Brownian motion,

16
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,740
so it has an Ito process.

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,690
dS over S is mu dt plus sigma dB with mu and sigma constant.

18
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,780
There's a knock-out barrier at X,

19
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,030
which we'll take to be below the strike price.

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,760
And the idea is that this is an option that

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,970
looks like an ordinary call option

22
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,130
until or unless the stock price hits the value of the barrier.

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,310
If it hits the barrier, it's done, and it becomes worthless.

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,470
Why do such things exist?

25
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,580
Well, they're cheaper than other options.

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,600
So there might be particular risks that it's tailored to.

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,000
There might be particular conditions where someone's

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,910
hedging a risk, and they figure under certain circumstances,

29
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,970
they might not need it.

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,030
But in any event, there's this option.

31
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,670
And there's an interesting complementarity

32
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,230
with another option, the knock-in option where

33
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,160
a knock-in option does the opposite.

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,800
It begins worthless.

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,370
But if the strike price hits the barrier, the specified barrier

36
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,310
in a specified way, then it comes to life,

37
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,760
and it becomes just like an ordinary vanilla option.

38
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,220
And it doesn't matter subsequently

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,970
what happens if it hits the barrier again.

40
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,910
Once it's alive, it stays alive.

41
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,950
So this is our setup.

42
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,480
And what can we do?

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,940
So why don't you take a few minutes to think about it,

44
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,905
and then we can work through it together.

45
00:01:56,905 --> 00:02:14,670


46
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,930
OK, let's look at it together.

47
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,320
So I've taken a risk-free rate equal to 0

48
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,990
to simplify the math, because this is a math example,

49
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,320
and it'll be a lot easier.

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,940
The Black-Scholes equation will go from four terms down to two.

51
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,360
So this is not a realistic solution that you could trade.

52
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,790
Although these days, with interest rates so low,

53
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,290
it might not be a bad approximation.

54
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,890
However, we're making a mathematical simplification

55
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,470
just for the purposes of doing our example here.

56
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,560
This is not the right financial equation.

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,620
So we're just setting r equal to 0 to simplify the math, OK?

58
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,340
So the idea is we want to think about what we saw in lecture

59
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,770
about how the diffusion and the random walk property of stock

60
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:02,820
prices looks like the behavior that we saw in the diffusion

61
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,530
equation where we saw that we could deal

62
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,660
with barriers by a method of images,

63
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,220
by looking at reflected points.

64
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,000
So we might think, we might have an idea

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,450
that we could try to take a look at the ordinary solution

66
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,220
to the Black-Scholes equation.

67
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,930
Let's say, so can we relate--

68
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:26,710
let's ask, can we relate the usual solution--

69
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:34,030
let me call it C of S,t to something at an image price--

70
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:44,610
let's call it-- let's say to option value

71
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,805
at the reflected price or the image price.

72
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:50,180
Now, how are we going to find it?

73
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,130
Well, let's just try doing the usual thing.

74
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,690
We know that S should be thought of as a logarithmic variable.

75
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,590
We know that we want the same distance below as above.

76
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,360
So we might take a look at, for example,

77
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,770
trying an image price of the form--

78
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:20,380
let me call it log S tilde to be 2 log X minus log S. So

79
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,260
that way, they're equally spaced above or below the barrier.

80
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,120
So if C is the value of the option-- that is,

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,950
it's the function that's a Black-Scholes function that we

82
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,900
have, it looks like we might be able to write things in terms

83
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,400
of--

84
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,570


85
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:46,580
so that is, could we have C of S, t minus C

86
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,940
of X squared over S and t?

87
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,480
Now you notice what happens.

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,252
So I've re--exponentiated, and we can see that this satisfies

89
00:04:58,252 --> 00:04:59,210
the boundary condition.

90
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,360
Because if S is equal to X, the two terms cancel.

91
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,030
If the first term has an X, is equal to X,

92
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,460
the second term has X squared over X,

93
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,030
the two terms would cancel.

94
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,400
So this is great.

95
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,177
It satisfies the boundary condition.

96
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:14,510
The problem is it doesn't quite satisfy the differential

97
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,510
equation.

98
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,270
So it's close, but we're not quite there.

99
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,570
So what we're going to do is let's try--

100
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:29,875
so unfortunately, not a solution.

101
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:37,900


102
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,600
So let's try something different.

103
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,395
Let's not give up too quickly just yet.

104
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:57,010
So let's try the form S over X to some power--

105
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:05,870
let's say, alpha-- times C of X squared over S times t.

106
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,290
What's our motivation for this?

107
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,010
Well, if we can do it, we can solve it.

108
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,780
We know that the Black-Scholes equation

109
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,930
is homogeneous in the powers of S.

110
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,727
I've written X as a constant.

111
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,560
But rather than just writing S to the alpha,

112
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,660
I'm writing it as S over X to the alpha.

113
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,730
Now it's automatically clear when

114
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,340
S equals X, that pre-factor is equal to 1,

115
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,510
and my usual equation goes through.

116
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,580
So this is a guess.

117
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,740
We're going to try it out and see where it leads.

118
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,918
And if we do it well, and we're lucky,

119
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:33,960
we'll have a good answer.

120
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,690
If not, it's back to the drawing board.

121
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,380
But let's give it a try.

122
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,420
So what shall we do?

123
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,980
Let's compute some partial derivatives, shall we?

124
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,710
So we have-- let's give this a name.

125
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:49,980
Let's call this f of S and t.

126
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,140
Obviously, it also depends on X and the other parameters.

127
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,925
So let's compute.

128
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:59,010


129
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,390
Partial of f with respect to t is

130
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:10,100
going to be S over X to the alpha partial of C

131
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,520
with respect to t.

132
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,100
That was easy, because the pre-factor

133
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,120
doesn't have any t's in it.

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,850
First, partial with respect to us is going to be--

135
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,900
I'm going to be able to pull out a factor of this

136
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,920
from my final answer.

137
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,020
This is going to be alpha over S times C.

138
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,050
And that comes from differentiating with respect

139
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,340
to the pre-factor.

140
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:42,940
S to the alpha goes as alpha S to the S minus 1-- excuse

141
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,850
me, S to the alpha, the derivative,

142
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,580
it's alpha S to the alpha minus 1.

143
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,070
So I've written that as S to the alpha.

144
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,890
And the minus 1 is down here, just so I can pull out

145
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,520
that common pre-factor.

146
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
And then I differentiate C, and I

147
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,845
need to worry about the X squared over S in its argument.

148
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:03,470
So I'm going to get another term, which

149
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:15,215
will be minus X squared over S squared times C prime dC dS.

150
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:18,540


151
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,890
And now if we compute the second derivative,

152
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,780
we get a somewhat messier expression,

153
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,205
but all will become clear shortly.

154
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,050


155
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,924
S over X raised to the alpha times--

156
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:34,299
now we're taking two derivatives,

157
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,688
so we're taking the derivative of the expression above.

158
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:38,730
We're going to get one term is going to be alpha,

159
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:43,470
alpha minus 1 over S squared times C. I'm

160
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,320
going to get acting on the X squared over S squared.

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,070
That's going to give me a term, which will

162
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,180
be plus 2 times alpha minus 1.

163
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,770


164
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,660
Rather, this is acting on the alpha minus S.

165
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,890
This is the cross-term.

166
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:11,950
The middle term is minus X squared over S squared times dC

167
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:21,650
dS plus one more term, finally, minus X squared over S squared,

168
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:29,630
squared, times second partial of C with respect to dS squared.

169
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,660
So let's take a look.

170
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,520
These are our three partial derivatives.

171
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,250
And remember, we're looking for the Black-Scholes equation

172
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,470
when we set the interest rate equal to 0.

173
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,970
And that means that there's no first derivative term.

174
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,480
So this term here won't be present.

175
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,870
We really just need to worry about this term and this one.

176
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,310
Now, notice something interesting

177
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,960
about this final expression.

178
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,860
Look at the alpha independence of it.

179
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,570
There's something we might guess is a lucky choice for alpha

180
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,370
or an inspired choice for alpha.

181
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,930
How about alpha equals 1?

182
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,610
If alpha equals 1, this part vanishes, this part vanishes,

183
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,610
and the coefficient looks very simple.

184
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,360


185
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:18,240
So if we choose alpha equals 1 for our trial solution,

186
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,300
then we get the equation partial of f with respect

187
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:30,970
to t plus sigma S squared over 2 second partial

188
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,090
of f with respect to squared--

189
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:41,210
is going to be S over X to the alpha, which is equal to 1,

190
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:50,770
times partial of C with respect to t plus sigma S tilde

191
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,440
squared over 2.

192
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,580
And actually, I should have put in tildes before.

193
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,160
Apologies.

194
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,580
Tilde.

195
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,800
And here for our derivatives, tilde,

196
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,430
where we're taking these derivatives and a tilde here.

197
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:17,670
So now we have that our expression for f

198
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,910
gives us something in terms of the transformed variable,

199
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,750
our expression here.

200
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,270
And we know that that's equal to 0,

201
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,040
because that satisfies the Black-Scholes equation.

202
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,000
So therefore, we have the value of the down-and-out call

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,250
option, down-and-out call.

204
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,360
That's this form.

205
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:50,760
C of down-and-out S and t is just

206
00:11:50,760 --> 00:12:03,010
C of t minus S over X C of S squared over S, t.

207
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,280
That is, the derivatives we had above with respect to tilde

208
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,250
are derivatives with respect to the first argument of the call

209
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,850
function.

210
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:19,760
So this is for S greater than or equal to the barrier X

211
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:29,060
and equal to 0 for S less than or equal to X.

212
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,630
And that's our solution.

213
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,860
So what we did is we took our notion

214
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,430
that the call option formula solves Black-Scholes equation.

215
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,570
We had a barrier.

216
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,480
We found that we could satisfy the barrier conditions

217
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,650
by using method of images by looking at a point below.

218
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,540
We constructed something that was close,

219
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,480
by looking at that argument X squared of S. That's

220
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,200
in logarithmic variables.

221
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,860
That's the equivalent to looking above and below the barrier

222
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,510
by an equal reflected amount.

223
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,970
We saw that we needed another pre-factor, just as

224
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,400
in our discussion of the survival probabilities.

225
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,090
We put in a guess for it.

226
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,090
We solved for our particular parameter,

227
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,800
alpha, that was in the coefficient.

228
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,140
We get a final result that gives us

229
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,420
the value of the option above the barrier

230
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,800
and 0 below the barrier.

231
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,810
And in fact, expanding this out, you'll

232
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,300
see that it looks very much like the expression

233
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,430
that we had for the survival probabilities.

234
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,975
And there we go.

235
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:22,475
