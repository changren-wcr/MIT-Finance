00:00:00,707 --> 00:00:03,290
PROFESSOR: One common approach to solving partial differential

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,390
equations is to make an educated guess

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,222
as to the form of the correct answer and see where it leads.

4
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:09,680
Now, this is a little bit different

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,210
from the special example that we had before,

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,420
where the example appeared full blown out of thin air,

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,020
we checked that at it worked, it satisfied the equations,

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,018
and we were done.

9
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:21,560
What do we do when we face other differential equations where

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,660
we're not given an answer completely?

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,150
Well, what we do is we look for the structure.

12
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,940
And this is one trick that works in many cases,

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,040
but by no means all, but it does come up

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,670
in some of our recent discussions.

15
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,850
So I thought we'd do a couple of examples together.

16
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,280
One of the methods is to try a form

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,550
where we might have a simple form where

18
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,720
the trial function, sometimes called ansatz,

19
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,765
factorizes into two forms.

20
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:48,140
So for example, suppose we didn't

21
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,240
know about that exponential solution.

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,900
We had this equation, we noticed that it has two terms-- one's

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,360
in t, one is in z.

24
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,230
The coefficients are constant.

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,770
So suppose we try a function.

26
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:08,640
Let's try a function of the form p of z and t

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,240
is f of z g of t, where f and z are unknown functions,

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,460
but they're each a function of a single variable.

29
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,700
So our goal is to see if we can simplify things.

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,430
This is a much simpler structure.

31
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,600
We can get individual equations for f and g, each of which

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,060
is an ordinary differential equation, not

33
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,870
a partial differential equation.

34
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,000
And then we impose boundary conditions,

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,760
which might give us the answer right away,

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,060
or it might require taking a superposition of solutions

37
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,820
using linearity-- that is, to take

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,400
different solutions of the same general form

39
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,910
and adding them together.

40
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,310
So let's take a look in this particular example.

41
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,660
If I turn the crank, get we compute

42
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,880
the partial derivatives.

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,460
Partial derivative of p with respect to t

44
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,830
is f of z is going to be constant times derivative of g.

45
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,320
And the second partial derivative

46
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,979
of p with respect to z squared is going

47
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,310
to be f double prime of z--

48
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,100
just a second derivative of the function f--

49
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,350
times g of z.

50
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,200
So now if we plug these into our differential equation,

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,890
what do we get?

52
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:32,770
Well, we get that f times g prime

53
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:38,770
has to be equal to 1/2 f double prime times g.

54
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,650
And let's divide the whole thing through by fg--

55
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,900
by p, that is--

56
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,530
by fg.

57
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,070


58
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:55,270
If we take this, we can rewrite things in this form.

59
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:04,920
Then we have g prime of t divided by g of t is 1/2

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,880
f double prime of z divided by f of z.

61
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,640
So this follows just from our differential equation.

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,210
We took the original equation, we substituted

63
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,690
in this specific form, we get this expression,

64
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,010
fg prime is 1/2 f double prime g.

65
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,100
We divide through by f and g to simplify things.

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,820
And you notice what happens here in this expression,

67
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,390
I have on the left side, I have g prime over g.

68
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,400
They're both functions of t only.

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,020
That's why I did the division.

70
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,430
On the right-hand side, those are functions of z only.

71
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,940
So how can I have a function of t equals a function of z

72
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,640
for all values of t and z?

73
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,600
Can't really work unless they're both constant.

74
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,190
So we're going to do is we're going to set them both equal

75
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,460
to a constant.

76
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,450
And that will give us one differential equation for g,

77
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,910
another one for f, and then when we solve them,

78
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,540
we can multiply f and g together, and we're done.

79
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,990
So let's call this constant, let's say we'll give it a name.

80
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,090
Let's call this lambda.

81
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,820
And now we have two differential equations.

82
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:25,430
So I've got g prime of t is equal to lambda g of t.

83
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,950
That's an easy equation to solve.

84
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,600
That's just an exponential.

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,720
g of t is equal to some constant--

86
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,340
let me call c0 e to the minus lambda t.

87
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,730
That's our first equation for g, and we're done.

88
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,460
What about f?

89
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,210
Just as easy.

90
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:51,130
f double prime of z is going to be equal to 2--

91
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,730
from the 1/2 in the diffusion equation-- times lambda times

92
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,270
f of z.

93
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,540
So I've got 2 lambda instead of lambda,

94
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,490
and I have 2 derivatives with respect

95
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,340
to z instead of one derivative with respect to t,

96
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,080
but the equation is very similar.

97
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,920
And its solution is f of z has two possible terms, two

98
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,950
constants of integration, c1 times

99
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:20,740
e to the square root of 2 lambda t

100
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:33,550
plus c2 times e to the minus square root of 2 lambda t.

101
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,430
Now, if lambda were a negative number, then

102
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,410
this would have been sines and cosines.

103
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,558
Now we don't need to worry about the square root.

104
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:42,850
We would have something times sine plus something times

105
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,400
cosine with an arbitrary linear combination of the two.

106
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,040
So e0, c1, c2, they're constants of integration.

107
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,850
Any linear combination of the terms f of z, g of t

108
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,690
will satisfy the conditions.

109
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:06,920
So we can take p of z, t can be f of z g of t.

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,430
And if we have multiple such terms,

111
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,193
we can take a sum over them.

112
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:13,360
And that will automatically satisfy the differential

113
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,040
equation, and then we're done.

114
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,200
So let's consider an exercise.

115
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,950


116
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,730
So let's try a particular form of the solution--

117
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:30,130
in this case, a function not of t times a function of y.

118
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:35,290
But let's try something of this form, where we let v of t and y

119
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,120
of the form that it's the exponential of something that's

120
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,320
linear in y, so that we can see that it might recover this

121
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,350
as a special case when t goes to 0.

122
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:53,410
And where f and g are functions of time alone,

123
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,350
and all of the y dependence is here

124
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,910
in this exponential to the minus y times f and g.

125
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,730
So please take a moment now, try it again.

126
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,280
Or if that's what you've already got, hang on.

127
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,720
And then we'll take a look through

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,910
and what happens when we substitute this

129
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,675
into our equation.

130
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:19,000


131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,290
OK, have you got it?

132
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,850
Well, what we're going to do is let's

133
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,850
compute partial derivatives and then substitute

134
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,670
into the equation and see if we can get simplified

135
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,550
equations for f and g.

136
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,000
Shall we?

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,660
So computing partial derivatives,

138
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,940
we have that partial of V with respect

139
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,650
to t in this form is going to be partial--

140
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,210
excuse me, it's going to be a regular derivative.

141
00:07:48,210 --> 00:08:00,160
It's going to be df dt minus y dg dt acting on V.

142
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,760
And the reason for this is because

143
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,080
of the exponential form.

144
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,970
You remember in our diffusion example,

145
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,810
we divided through by e.

146
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,660
Here it's helpful if we have a form where everything ends up

147
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,830
being proportional in the different terms.

148
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,300
So taking derivatives with respect to time, I have this.

149
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,900
What about the space derivatives?

150
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:25,690
Well, I have partial of V with respect to y

151
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,890
is going to be minus g times V and

152
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:34,299
the second partial derivative of V with respect to y squared.

153
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,990
Because remember y, we're linear in the exponent.

154
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:44,440
This is going to be g squared of V. Minus g times minus g

155
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,160
just gives us g squared.

156
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,560
So now if we take these partial derivatives

157
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,590
and we substitute into our original differential equation,

158
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,500
what do we get?

159
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:04,270
We get that it's going to have V times

160
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:14,670
df dt minus y dg dt plus 1/2 sigma

161
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:27,010
squared g squared plus alpha yg is equal to 0.

162
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:27,910
Let's rewrite that.

163
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,170
Let's notice that we've got terms that are linear in y,

164
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,470
like this one and this one, and the others have no explicit

165
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,220
y's.

166
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,770
So let's group them in terms of those that are linear in y

167
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,700
and those that are constants.

168
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,050
And we can divide by V-- we're assuming that V is non-zero.

169
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,850
After all, we've assumed it's in exponential form.

170
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:57,340
So now we would have df dt plus 1/2 sigma squared

171
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:06,700
g squared plus y times alpha g minus dg dt.

172
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,480


173
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,350
And this has to be equal to 0.

174
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,330
Well, how can this be equal to 0?

175
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,030
It has to be equal to 0 for all t and for all y.

176
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,590
So the coefficient of y has to be equal to 0.

177
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,400
And then the constant term, this first term in parentheses,

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,660
has to be equal to 0 separately.

179
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,960
So now we have two equations for df dt and for dg dt.

180
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,430
Let's do the second one first, because this term has only g's.

181
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,970
This one here has a partial of f with respect to t,

182
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,430
and it's going to depend on the value of g.

183
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,020
We don't know what g is yet.

184
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,030
So why don't we solve g by solving

185
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,060
this equation, plug g in over here,

186
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,250
and then we can solve for f?

187
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,460
So these equations are pretty easy.

188
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,350
Let's take a look.

189
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,130
So taking the g equation first, we're

190
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:11,780
going to have that dg dt is going to be equal to alpha g.

191
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:17,480
And that tells us that g of t is going to be some constant

192
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,910
times e to the alpha t.

193
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,370
And now remember what our initial conditions were.

194
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:29,400
Our initial conditions said that at time 0,

195
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,430
the function should be e to the minus y.

196
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:41,070
That means that g of t should be equal to 1

197
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,420
when t is equal to 0, and f of t should be equal to 0

198
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,130
when t is equal to 0.

199
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,960
So let me just add that up here for discussion

200
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,570
and to remind us.

201
00:11:51,570 --> 00:12:04,240
This implies f of 0 equals 0, and g of 0

202
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,250
has to be equal to 1.

203
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,810
So now let's take a look at our special form.

204
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,280
And we can see that that's easy.

205
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,430
That means that c has to be equal to 1.

206
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:22,470
So this says the g of t is just going to be e to the alpha t.

207
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,290
And when t is equal to 0, g is equal to 1.

208
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,555
And we're done.

209
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:28,680
Now, let's look at the differential equation for f.

210
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,390


211
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:37,000
Well, we have df dt is going to be equal to minus sigma squared

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,870
over 2g squared.

213
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,290
But we know what g is, we just solved for it.

214
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,480
So this is going to be minus sigma squared over 2 e

215
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,440
to the 2 alpha t, so I've just put in the explicit form of g

216
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,920
squared.

217
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,760
And if we want to solve that, that's easy also.

218
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,930
If the derivative of f is an exponential, then f

219
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,130
is an exponential.

220
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,610
We just need to get the constant right.

221
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,960
So we're going to have a constant of integration.

222
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,680
So this tells us that f is going to be equal to minus--

223
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,700
excuse me-- minus sigma squared over 4 alpha e

224
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,600
to the 2 alpha t plus a constant.

225
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,860
And then f of 0 equals 0 gives us

226
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,770
our final form, that f of t, that's to be equal to sigma

227
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:46,540
squared over 4 alpha times 1 minus e to the 2 alpha t.

228
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,980
And you can check.

229
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,190
When t goes to 0, this exponential goes to 1.

230
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,060
1 minus 1 gives 0, and f of t of 0 zero.

231
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,340
Now finally, we've got our solution

232
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,730
to the original equation.

233
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:13,860
So therefore, the solution is V of y and-- or I guess part of t

234
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,360
and y--

235
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,940


236
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,010
either way, we know what it is-- is

237
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:24,980
going to be the exponential of sigma squared over

238
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:36,260
4 alpha times 1 minus e to the 2 alpha t minus y times

239
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,030
e to the alpha t.

240
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,020
And that's it.

241
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,650
So it's an exponential with exponentials in the exponent,

242
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,590
but it solves our differential equation, as you can check.

243
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,120
You can go back to the beginning.

244
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,610
It has the desired form that we wanted.

245
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,100
And because it satisfies the appropriate boundary

246
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,710
conditions, we know that it's the right answer

247
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,040
that we were looking for.

248
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,000
