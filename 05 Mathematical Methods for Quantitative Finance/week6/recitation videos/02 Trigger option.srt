1
00:00:01,332 --> 00:00:03,540
PROFESSOR: Let's look a bit more about option pricing

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,150
in the presence of boundaries and barriers.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,590
So we've seen that usually in a partial differential

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,550
equation where a derivative value is somewhat universal,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,370
it really depends on what the underlying is

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,460
and the relationship between the risk factors and the underlying

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,320
and the derivative.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,322
But the boundary conditions matter a lot,

9
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:26,280
and they determine what kind of option we have.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,920
So we have vanilla options, puts and calls,

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,380
with our traditional payoffs above or below a strike price.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,370
But there are all kinds of other options, usually called

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,400
exotic options if they're not vanilla options.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,280
And they may depend on other conditions that

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,110
could happen in time, they could depend on the path of s,

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,680
and they might involve looking at specific events or even

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,080
their lookback options, whose value depends

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,780
on the entire past trajectory of s.

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,190
For example, it could depend on the maximum that

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,120
s during its lifetime, which would not

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,310
be known until expiration.

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,190
So let's take a look at an example here called

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,090
a trigger option.

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,150
So I'd like to assume that s is given by a usual geometric

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,230
Brownian motion.

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,110
And this trigger option gives the owner

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,480
the right, but not the obligation,

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,000
to buy the underlying stock at a strike price K

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,070
if the stock value exceeds another value called

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,140
the trigger X at expiration.

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,340
So the underlying follows the Ito process, dS over s

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,160
equals mu dt plus sigma dB.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,930
What PDE does the option satisfy, and what's its price?

34
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,840
So let me give you one hint, which

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,620
is what you might want to do is sketch the option payoff.

36
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,420
And you could even ask, could this

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,602
be replicated by another series of contracts?

38
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,310
So you might consider that we're thinking

39
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,770
about-- the generic call option would have a payoff

40
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,880
function that looks like this.

41
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,325
A function that had a strike price at X

42
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,950
would have a payoff function that looks

43
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,960
like this if it were a call.

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,910
But this one is a little bit different.

45
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,510
The payoff is the payoff above K,

46
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,860
but only if the price exceeds X. So

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,140
take a moment to see if you can map it out and draw a picture.

48
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,100
And if you can solve the equation, even better.

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,470
I'll be back in just a moment.

50
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:39,943


51
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:42,290
So first, the payoff.

52
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,810
The payoff should-- let's draw this in red, I guess.

53
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:54,670
So the payoff is going to be 0 until we get X.

54
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,190
Because if we're below X, we don't get anything.

55
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,000
And from that point forward, the payoff

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,240
is the same we would have had here, that we would have had

57
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,960
for the ordinary call option.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:22,890
So one way to say this is that the payoff is

59
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,390
equal to the payoff for ST greater than x

60
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:38,350
is going to be ST minus K, but only for ST greater than x.

61
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,270
Well, another way we can write that

62
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:51,900
is we can say that ST minus K is equal to ST minus X plus X

63
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,850
minus K. So that is to say, the first part,

64
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,920
ST minus X would be the payoff if the strike price

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,590
were equal to X. That is, that would be this payoff function.

66
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,690
But that would be a little bit too low, right?

67
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,390
We have an extra piece that we're missing here.

68
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,940
And that distance, because this has slope 1, is X minus K.

69
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,459
And that says that if we're below, we get nothing.

70
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,040
But if we're above, we get X minus K units.

71
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,650
Hmm, that sounds like a digital option or a binary option.

72
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,230
So that says that we could replicate.

73
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,530
So this can be replicated--

74
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,450


75
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:44,900
the payoff can be replicated with an option

76
00:04:44,900 --> 00:05:08,872
of strike X plus X minus K binary options of strike K.

77
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:10,140
Oops, sorry.

78
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,210
I didn't mean to block that out.

79
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,030
So the solution is just going to be the sum,

80
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,140
and we've computed those in class.

81
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,380
So we can write down the Black-Scholes solution

82
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,830
plus the solution to the binary part.

83
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,500
So our answer is that the value of our derivative V

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:37,090
is going to be S times phi of T plus minus X

85
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:49,400
e to the minus RT times phi of d minus plus X

86
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,080
minus K times the solution for a binary option,

87
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,440
e to the minus RT phi of d minus.

88
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,740
I've taken little t to be equal to 0 for our current time,

89
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,020
and big T is the time to maturity.

90
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,270
And then you notice there's a small cancellation

91
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,870
between these two terms.

92
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:18,800
So this is equal to S phi of T plus minus K e

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,890
to the minus RT phi of t minus--

94
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,600
where we need to make sure that we

95
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,230
use a d plus and a d minus that are appropriate for the strike

96
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,380
price X. So where d plus minus are

97
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:45,450
equal to the log of S over X e to the minus RT divided

98
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:53,400
by sigma square root of T plus or minus 1/2 sigma squared

99
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,010
of T. And as usual, phi represents

100
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,440
the Gaussian cumulative distribution function.

101
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
Now, the lesson here is that we look

102
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,610
at what the payoff is, we check the boundary conditions.

103
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,880
And wherever possible, we use our existing solutions

104
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,610
to Black-Scholes to combine them in a way--

105
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,190
because we know that we can always

106
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,900
take a linear combination of solutions

107
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,400
to the partial differential equation

108
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,460
to get another solution to the partial differential equation.

109
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,980
What we need is to be able to match the boundary conditions.

110
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,020
And this equation matches the boundary conditions,

111
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,500
which are the specified payoff at expiration.
