1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,950
PROFESSOR: Let's look at some of the basic objects

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,720
and terminology in probability.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,820
A random variable is really a function.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,880
We could really call it a random-valued function

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,300
on the sample space.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,480
So the sample space is a set of all events,

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,309
or possible outcomes of experiments,

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,830
or possible observations that we might have.

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,600
And we want to assign numbers to them

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,430
so that we can do some math, so that we can do some analytics.

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,500
So for example, if we have the abstract outcomes of success

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,200
or failure in an experiment, or we flip coins,

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,750
and we have heads and tails, or we roll dice,

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,000
and we get one of sides to come up,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,580
we are used to assigning numbers to those.

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,570
And those numbers are the random variables.

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,930
So I've given a couple of examples right here.

18
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,700
In the case of heads and tails, we

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,525
might assign them 1 or minus 1.

20
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,150
But there's nothing special about that.

21
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,520
You could pick a different random variable w

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,880
and pick different values, 12 and minus 3, if you'd like.

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,215
Z is also a common random variable

24
00:00:58,215 --> 00:00:59,840
that we see where we have two outcomes,

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,880
and we think of them as being success or failure

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,110
of an experiment.

27
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,840
They might be gains or losses on an investment.

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,455
Again, two states, we map the two possible states

29
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,000
to two possible numbers.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,710
We could have a large number of states,

31
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,110
and we could combine different kinds of outcome.

32
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,180
We could add two dice together, we

33
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,200
could add a coin flip and a die, and we might also

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,850
have continuous outcomes.

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,220
So they don't need to be discrete.

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,270
What's the probability?

37
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,980
Well, we describe the probability

38
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,160
of an outcome as a number that we

39
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,940
assign to a random variable taking a particular value.

40
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,690
So for example, in the case of a fair coin,

41
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,130
the probability of observing X equals 1 would be 1/2.

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,380
For the case of Y equals 2, in the case of our dice,

43
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,630
we know that we would only see that in 1

44
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,450
out of 36 times when both the dice come up

45
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,680
with 1 on one side.

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,822
We can compute functions of a random variable as well,

47
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:01,780
and we'll have more to say about this later on.

48
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,200
But for example, if we take X squared,

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,620
the probability of observing X squared equals 1

50
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,039
is 1 because X could be plus 1 or minus 1

51
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,540
with equal probability.

52
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,630
And either way, X squared is equal to 1 and so on.
