00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
PROFESSOR: The next distribution that's common everywhere

1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,795
in finance and statistics and in many other areas

2
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:10,810
of applied mathematics is the Gaussian distribution

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,190
or the normal distribution.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,200
And I'll use the two terms interchangeably.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,580
So the normal distribution is the famous bell curve

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,920
that we see over here, OK?

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,860
So the bell curve is symmetric around 0.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,230
It has a width like, goes all the way out

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,550
to minus infinity and plus infinity.

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,920
So it's unbounded.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,870
But most of its support--

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,470
99% of its support lies between plus and minus 3.

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,780
And the tails get short very quickly.

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,490
What's the functional form of it?

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,100
Well, it's e to the minus x squared.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,390
Specifically, we can write this as e to the minus x

17
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,290
minus mu quantity squared over 2 sigma squared.

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,020
And mu and sigma have a particular meaning.

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,350
If we set mu to 0 and sigma equal to 1,

20
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,230
we would have this standardized form, which

21
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,480
I've written in terms of z.

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,050
And generally, I'll try to reserve z for this special form

23
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,460
for this standardized random variable where in terms of z,

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,380
this is peaked at 0.

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,540
And its width-- its standard deviation,

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,260
which we can compute, is equal to 1.

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,970


28
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,920
If I replace z by x minus mu divided by sigma,

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,670
I can recover this form here.

30
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,300
And if I remember to use my change of variables formula,

31
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,810
that's where this sigma squared under the square root

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,580
in the denominator comes from.

33
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,790
But there's a good physical interpretation of mu and sigma.

34
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,040
So the mu is the center of the distribution.

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,080
Because exponential will decrease as its argument

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,800
increases, the largest value the exponential takes

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,460
is when either z vanishes down here or when x is equal to mu.

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,400
And that corresponds to the peak of the distribution here.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,980
Or at the peak of these different distributions,

40
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,009
each of which is computed for a different value of mu,

41
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,500
mu tells you where the center of the distribution is.

42
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,220
So if we want to shift the distribution left or right,

43
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,660
we change mu.

44
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,600
If we want to change the width of the distribution,

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,980
we change sigma.

46
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,430
A small sigma is a narrow distribution.

47
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,400
A large sigma is a wide distribution

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,200
because the area under the curve needs

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,470
to equal 1, the curve if it's wide,

50
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,120
it's going to be lower down.

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,330
And if the sigma is narrow, then it's going to be peaked.

52
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,950
And the center will be higher.

53
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,450
There are a couple of handy formulas

54
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,750
for checking the normalization of the Gaussian.

55
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,020
And you should get familiar with doing small scale integrals.

56
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,400
We'll be doing them a bit.

57
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,310
But handy formula for getting the normalization

58
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,480
are a definite integral with this generating function.

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,090
There's a trick for doing this using polar coordinates.

60
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,760
But for right now, you just need to know the result

61
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,550
because you can get everything you need from this that if you

62
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,830
look at the integral of e to the minus ax squared,

63
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,010
we notice that this is a definite integral.

64
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,800
But it contains a as a constant under the integral.

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,890
So the integral is a function of a.

66
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,100
And the function is square root of pi over a.

67
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,500
And that's what gives us that normalization factor,

68
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,060
the 1 over square root of 2 pi sigma squared.

69
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,750
And so that when we integrate the probability density,

70
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,880
it integrates to one the way it has to.

71
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,550
And if we need to get higher moments,

72
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,030
we can do it by differentiating.

73
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,340
So, for example, you notice that if I differentiate the integral

74
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,120
with respect to the parameter, if I compute dI da--

75
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,840
or actually minus dI da, OK, I can move the derivative

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,280
inside the integral.

77
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,293
The coefficient of a in the exponential is x squared.

78
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:55,085
And that gives me the integral of a squared

79
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:57,570
e to the minus ax squared.

80
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,440
And that we recognize as the expectation of x squared.

81
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,160
So I can get moments by taking derivatives.

82
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,050
And we'll see how to generalize this as well.

83
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,770
What about the cumulative distribution function?

84
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,510
Well, F of z in this case, which is sometimes known as capital

85
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,290
phi--

86
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,980
in some places, you'll see it written with the letter N

87
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,750
and sometimes related to a function known

88
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,230
as the error function-- is a definite integral.

89
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,730
We integrate from minus infinity to infinity [correction: z]

90
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,790
of e to the minus z' squared over 2.

91
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,690
And that gives us this distribution function.

92
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,240
You notice that if we differentiate the integral

93
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,560
we get back our probability density.

94
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,700
So this gives us the probability that the random variable

95
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,130
will be between any two points.

96
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,590
Or for F of z itself that it will be

97
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,710
equal to the given z or less.

98
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,440
The log-normal distribution shows up in finance as well.

99
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,710
We often look at logarithmic returns.

100
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,060
And our standard model for return distributions on assets

101
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,860
is a starting point to see if the logarithmic returns might

102
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,150
be normally distributed.

103
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,030
And that distribution is called the log-normal distribution.

104
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,010
The way it's defined mathematically

105
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,910
is simply to define X to be log of Y.

106
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,180
And we can compute x is log of y here

107
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,360
for a probability density and substitution,

108
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,370
apply change of variable formula.

109
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,820
And we see that we get this form right here.

110
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,838
Now, computationally, this is just to change the variable.

111
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,380
So if we're going to compute moments,

112
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,930
we can use whichever variables we prefer.

113
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,770
And the usual application of this is in looking at returns.

114
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,410
So we often have a relationship between the simple returns

115
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,220
that we designate by R, simple returns on an asset.

116
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,240
And the logarithmic returns are defined

117
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,410
to be e to the little r minus 1 is big R.

118
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,020
We'll see in more detail how that works with pricing.

119
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,420
But we can compute with respect to either distribution.

120
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,020
Remember that the moments are just numbers.

121
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,960
And whichever way we choose to do the integral-- whatever

122
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,090
changes the variables we make in the integral--

123
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,500
it isn't going to change the final result.

124
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,000
