00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,490
PROFESSOR: We have continuous random variables that

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,930
don't have discrete outcomes.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,620
They can take an uncountably infinite number of variables.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,460
The classic case is a uniform distribution.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,610
For example, we might think of the interval between 0 and 1

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,160
with all values being equally likely.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,440
Because they're uncountably infinite,

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,940
the probability of finding any one point,

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,450
which is equal likelihood for any other point,

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,390
is proportional to 1 over the number

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,900
of points, which is infinite.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,220
So the probability of any particular observation is 0.

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,780
We say that if a given point has "measure 0", that doesn't mean

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,040
it can't be observed.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,710
What it means is that we really should ask a better question.

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,360
Rather than asking about the chance

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,960
of finding an exact value, an exact real number,

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,560
we can ask about the probability that it lies within a range.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,110
And there, for that, we have a probability density function,

20
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,880
p of x, that describes the probability of finding

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,790
a value, the particular value x, in an interval with dx.

22
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,550
And in the case of the uniform distribution, p of x

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,550
is just a constant.

24
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,530
It's equal to 1.

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,470
But more generally, we define the probability

26
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,100
that the random variable x, is observed between two values

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,980
a and b, when x is continuous, by taking

28
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,183
the integral between a and b.

29
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:22,961


30
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:26,070
Probability distributions need to satisfy two properties.

31
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,560
First, probabilities need to be positive.

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,840
Second, they need to sum to 1.

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,480
So we don't have a definition of negative probabilities.

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,290
But we do require that the probabilities sum to 1.

35
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,590
And we think of that as saying that our sample space is

36
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,710
appropriately designated, and our probability function

37
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,540
is a reasonable description.

38
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,980
If we assign a probability to everything and probability

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,240
equals 1, it means that something happens.

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,060
So in the case of a discrete distribution,

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,590
the probabilities sum to 1.

42
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,780
In the case of the continuous distribution,

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,010
they integrate to 1.

44
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,800
We sometimes think about the cumulative distribution

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,530
function, which is the partial integral

46
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,050
of a continuous function or a partial sum

47
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,460
of the discrete function.

48
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,010
It's the probability of observing

49
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,160
the random variable, big X, taking

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,580
a value less than some particular value, little x.

51
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,190
So we can think of that in the case of a distribution

52
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,530
as integrating in the continuous case,

53
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,730
from minus infinity up to the value x of interest.

54
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,880
And if we let x go to infinity, that then

55
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,160
covers the entire support of the probability density.

56
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,860
And it should be equal to 1.

57
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,040
Obviously, this is closely related to p of x.

58
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,800
And we can go backwards just by differentiating.

59
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,300
So because f is the integral of p,

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,060
we have the p is the derivative of f.

61
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,930
Now that's trivial from the definition.

62
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,630
But there are certain cases where

63
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,630
it's easier to construct f than p,

64
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,650
and this formula lets us recover p by differentiating

65
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,970
the formula for f.

66
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,580
Also, just from the fundamental theorem of calculus,

67
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,790
there's a convenient formula for the probability.

68
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,950
If we know what big F is, if we know

69
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,170
what the CDF, the cumulative distribution function

70
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,960
is for a given distribution, then we can just

71
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,360
take f of b minus f of a.

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,965
That computes the value between the two limits of integration.

73
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:22,340
It's the same value that we would

74
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,880
have for doing the definite integral from a to b.

75
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,440
Sometimes we'll want to change variables.

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,000
And if we do that, we need to be aware that the probability

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,190
density is the density in the sense

78
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,730
that we need to integrate it.

79
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,770
So we need to change not only the x in p of x,

80
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,080
but we need to change x in the differential that

81
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,190
accompanies it.

82
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,490
So the rule for change of variables is very simple--

83
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,620
that if we change variables, if we replace

84
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,100
x by y, which is some function of x, then

85
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,580
we define a new probability distribution for y

86
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,480
simply by saying that g of y dy, whatever g of y is,

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,960
had better capture the same thing as p of x dx.

88
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,860
So that means that p of x is of why do

89
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,970
y we divide both sides by dy.

90
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,400
And we can write this saying g of y

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,180
is p of x divided by dy/dx.

92
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,269
Now, if we're given a function y of x,

93
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,860
we can compute the derivative.

94
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,890
We take its absolute value in the event

95
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,190
that y is a decreasing function of x.

96
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,900
So probabilities, remember, need to be positive.

97
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,580
If our change of variables goes in the opposite direction,

98
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,070
if it decreases as a function of x,

99
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,090
the absolute value makes sure that we get a positive sign.

100
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,240
And we need to take special care and break things up piecewise,

101
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,460
in the event the y of x changes sign,

102
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,630
that there are places where the derivative vanishes.

103
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,172
But that's not really going to happen

104
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:54,110
in the financial application.
