1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,730
PROFESSOR: Now let's look at sums of random variables.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,860
And this is going to open the door

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,460
to our construction of discrete time stochastic processes.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,460
We're going to use a basic property for probability,

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,500
that if we have random variables,

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,680
we can add them together to get new random variables.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,120
We'll see that we'll do everything

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,250
in terms of the expectations, which

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,100
are going to be easy to compute using linearity.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,830
And you're going to have really interesting behavior

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,760
as a function of the number of items in our sum.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,460
So when we have several random variables,

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,170
we construct a new one just by adding them together.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,160
So imagine I've got a collection of n random variables--

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,500
xyz, X1, X2, X3, X4 to the Xn, and I define their sum.

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,750
There are lots of other functions we could talk about.

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,708
We could take products.

18
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:51,110
We could do all kinds of polynomials

19
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,910
or transcendental functions, but we're

20
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,430
going to only be talking about the sum

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,490
of basic random variables.

22
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,660
Now in certain cases, we could ask what the full probability

23
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,410
distribution is S, in terms of the probability

24
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:11,150
distributions for X1, X2, X3 and up through Xn.

25
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,360
They have a definite probability distribution.

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,400
So that determines what happens with S.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,270
But in many cases, we don't need to know

28
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,200
everything about S. We just need to know about its moments.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,870
And those are easy.

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,510
They're easy because we can use linearity.

31
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,120
What we do is we apply the expectation operator

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,190
to the sum, and we see that the expectation of the sum is

33
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,430
the sum of the expectations of the individual X's.

34
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,360
So the full probability distribution

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,160
can be quite complicated.

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,710
But what we need to do is to get the mean value,

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,010
we just add the means of the individual variables.

38
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,260
Now due to the Central Limit Theorem,

39
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,470
this is actually often all we need,

40
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,810
because we get a tremendous amount out of this.

41
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,120
If we n is a large number, then the sum of random variables

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,639
is going to converge on a Gaussian random variable.

43
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,150
That's the distribution of S will approach a Gaussian

44
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,110
distribution, regardless of what the X initial distributions

45
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,610
are.

46
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,700
And we'll see that in just a moment in pictures,

47
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,090
and then in a subsequent video, I'll

48
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,190
show you how you can derive that.

49
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,860


50
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,740
But let's take a look first, at where

51
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,900
we might apply this sum of random variables

52
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,320
in financial terms.

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,800
So one case is when we look at portfolios.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,400
So suppose we have a portfolio that consists of N assets.

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,720
And let's let w represent the weight of asset,

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,640
i, within a portfolio.

57
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,100
So i runs 1, 2, 3, 4 through the number of assets we have.

58
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,030
Suppose we have stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial

59
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,590
average-- i would run from 1 through 30

60
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,510
and would be equal to 30.

61
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,890
Let's let r sub i be the return on that asset.

62
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,600
And let's think of it as being a random variable.

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,510
So each of the stocks is going to have

64
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,690
an independent probability distribution.

65
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,150
And each probability distribution

66
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,740
has a mu_i which is the expectation of R.

67
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,550
And it's got a variance, sigma i squared, which

68
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,580
is just a variance of the random variable, R_i

69
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,050
So what's a portfolio?

70
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,280
A portfolio is a weighted average of stocks.

71
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,390
So here our weights are not probabilities,

72
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,460
they're capital allocations to a portfolio so the rule

73
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,700
and this is just arithmetic that the return

74
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,790
on a portfolio the simple return on a portfolio in a given

75
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,000
period is the weighted average of the returns

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,600
on the individual assets.

77
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,350
So we've got this bilinear form.

78
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,470
We've got a linear combination of the returns--

79
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,390
w1R1 plus w2R2 and so on.

80
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,060
So we have a linear combination of random variables.

81
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,530
So it's not just a sum, it's a weighted average.

82
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,420
What's the expectation of R?

83
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, that's the portfolio, mean return.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,480
And the expectation of R using linearity,

85
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,910
is the weighted average of the expectations

86
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,010
of the individual stock returns.

87
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,420
No surprise-- the expected return on the portfolio

88
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,970
is the weighted average of the expected return

89
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,600
of the individual stocks.

90
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,180
So that's a case where we don't know what the full return

91
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,290
distribution is.

92
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,900
But we've related the mean of the portfolio

93
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,750
to the mean of the individual stocks.

94
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,220
What about the variance?

95
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,610
Well, if the variables were uncorrelated,

96
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,760
that would be one thing.

97
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,870
But that is not the case with most financial variables.

98
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,760
And certainly, it's not the case for asset returns.

99
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,700
So let's take a look at what happens

100
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,340
when we compute the variance.

101
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,830
What we'll see as we define the variance of our portfolio,

102
00:04:50,830 --> 00:05:05,230
R_p Remember that R_p is just this weighted average.

103
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:11,520
So when we take a look at R_p minus mu_p

104
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,570
we can expand that out in terms of our individual stocks

105
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,810
in this way.

106
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,990
And if we expand out the quadratics--

107
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,520
so this is a quadratic.

108
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,260
We expand out all the terms and we

109
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,330
group them together, we get two kinds of terms.

110
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,770
We get diagonal terms.

111
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:32,370
We get an i with itself gives a set of n terms, w_i squared

112
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,940
times the expectation of R_i minus mu_i quantity squared

113
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,960
plus all the cross terms that come from i not equal to j.

114
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,030
These terms, you'll notice, are a weighting factor,

115
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:51,570
w_i squared, times the variance of stock, i.

116
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:58,350
And the cross terms give us for each i not equal to j or twice

117
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,150
for each i less than j, wiwj times the covariance

118
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,470
of R_i and R_j.

119
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,060
And that just comes from expanding

120
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,030
out the polynomial inside the expectation

121
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,490
here, and grouping the terms together.

122
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,800
We can rewrite these two terms in terms of sigma squared.

123
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,860
Sigma i squared is the variance of R_i.

124
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,830
And using our formula for the correlation,

125
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,550
we can relate the covariance to the correlation by noting that

126
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,000
the covariance is just sigma_i sigma_j ,

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,100
times the correlation of i with j,

128
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,310
which I've denoted here by rho_ij .

129
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,820
So you notice the structure of the formula that we have.

130
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,420
The return on the portfolio is quadratic.

131
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,520
Excuse me, the variance of the portfolio

132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,500
is quadratic in the weights.

133
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,700
It has a term in w_i squared times the sigma is squared

134
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:58,530
for each of the stocks, plus twice w_iw_j, sigma_i sigma_j ,

135
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,750
rho_ij .

136
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,030
So if the stocks were uncorrelated,

137
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,040
we'd only have the first term.

138
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,780
And if the w's were 0, of course, this would vanish.

139
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,630
A couple of special cases of this are worth keeping in mind.

140
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,020
One of them is if the correlations

141
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,200
rho_ij were equal to 0, then we see we have the first term.

142
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,840
But notice that it becomes the sum of a bunch of squares.

143
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,410
On the other hand, if rho_ij in this expression,

144
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,220
if these were all equal to 1, then you

145
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,470
notice that this becomes an expression

146
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,920
for a perfect square.

147
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,810
If rho_ij is equal to 1, then the variance of the portfolio

148
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,450
is the weighted average squared.

149
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,870
So it's the square of the sum instead

150
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,640
of the sum of the squares.

151
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,850
Finally if the correlation were 0

152
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,270
and everything were the same-- all the stocks were the same.

153
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,860
They all had the same volatility.

154
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,450
They all had the same variance.

155
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,050
And the portfolio were equal weighted, what would we see?

156
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,090
Well, if the portfolio is equal weighted,

157
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,000
each stock will have weight 1/n.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,540
If the sigmas are all equal, we can give them the name.

159
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,140
If the sigma i's are all equal, let's call it sigma 0.

160
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,910
And now, this formula here, if we bring it down and substitute

161
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,180
those in, we see it as a portfolio value becomes

162
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,330
sigma 0 squared divided by n.

163
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,620
That is we've got 1 over n squared.

164
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,470
But there are n identical terms in the sum.

165
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,620
So we get sigma 0 squared over n,

166
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,750
which means that the volatility of the portfolio

167
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,740
is proportional to 1 over square root of n.

168
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,050
That means that as n gets large, the volatility in the portfolio

169
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,050
goes down.

170
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,710
And this is the basic idea behind portfolio

171
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,160
diversification.
