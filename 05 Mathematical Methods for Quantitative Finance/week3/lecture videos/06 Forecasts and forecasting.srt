PROFESSOR: Forecasts with time series models

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,880
are predictions about future observations,

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,640
future realizations of our random variables

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,940
that are conditioned on information that's known

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,630
at the time of the forecast.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,180
Now, what is a forecast?

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,250
Well, the output could be one of a number of different things.

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,860
It could be a point forecast, for example,

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,510
the price of Tesla's stock in 30 days, the specific number.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,660
It could be a probability forecast.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,110
Probability of rain this weekend is 30%.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,690
It could be a full distribution, that

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,950
is we might say the probability of stock XYZ,

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,830
its return distribution over the next year

15
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,960
is log normally distributed with a mu of 10% and a sigma of 30%.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,500
So any of those could be the output

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,547
of a forecasting process.

18
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:53,130
And, of course, we'll want to evaluate

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,750
the quality of forecasts.

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,990
And in many ways it's less dramatic or mysterious

21
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,580
than it might seem.

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,650
One of the attributes of a forecast

23
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,319
is that it has a horizon or it may have multiple horizons.

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,720
That is, a forecast is framed in terms

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,240
of two points, the point at which we make the forecast--

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
and that we need to know so that we

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,980
know what information is available

28
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,780
on which to base the forecast--

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,620
and the future date when the realization will be known.

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,710
Clearly, we can't judge the quality of a forecast

31
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,720
until that date passes.

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,870
And then we can compare our predictions

33
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,850
with the subsequent observations.

34
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,010
So we usually think of a horizon.

35
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,300
And as time progresses between now and the horizon,

36
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,180
unless the horizon is five minutes from now

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,300
or the next day, if there are multiple steps in which we

38
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,810
could update our horizons based on new information evolving,

39
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,670
the forecast could change.

40
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,590
We may have rolling forecasts.

41
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,760
We may have forecast where we move both the current time

42
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,000
and the deadline, or very commonly, we

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,080
have forecasts for a particular date, an earnings release date,

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,490
and end of the fiscal year, or picnic weather for this Sunday.

45
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,360
Where as time evolves we may be interested in the same terminal

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,150
date which may be fixed on the calendar,

47
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,580
but we have new information that arises

48
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,320
and we can update our forecasts.

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,190
So if I said that our chance of rain for Sunday is 30%,

50
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,230
perhaps yesterday I made a forecast

51
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,110
based on what I knew at the time and I said it was 0,

52
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,400
it wasn't going to rain.

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,590
And tomorrow my forecast might change again.

54
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,310
Perhaps it goes to 50% as new information comes along.

55
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,830


56
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,280
In time series models we want to know what's available,

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,740
what's the information set.

58
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,830
And now we're going to use the same machinery that we

59
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,550
did in solving models in closed form unconditionally,

60
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,040
but now we're going to condition on information

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,900
that's available at a particular point in time.

62
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,960
And here's where the lag structure

63
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,380
of models such AR and MA models, and RM models more

64
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,220
generally come in.

65
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,880
So let's take a look at an example.

66
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,910
Let's look at AR1 model.

67
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,190
So here for convenience, I've simplified our usual AR1 model

68
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,400
by defining a new variable y which is

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,270
Rt minus mu divided by sigma.

70
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,530
So I've taken our usual defining equation

71
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,690
and I just divided it through by sigma.

72
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,240
Now, this looks like a normalized random variable.

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,150
But, remember, that's not necessarily the case.

74
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,230
Sigma is not the standard deviation of R,

75
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,750
it's just the coefficient we put in front of Z in our model.

76
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,140
So this is scaled to be dimensionless.

77
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,600
It certainly looks like it might have 0 mean and some unit 1

78
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,590
size variance, but that's something

79
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,840
that we would need to compute.

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,790
We can't just infer that from here.

81
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,740
The reason I defined it this way was

82
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,963
to clean up and reduce some of the parameters

83
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,880
so that we really only have one parameter left

84
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,710
in our model, lambda.

85
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,920
And we can put the others back by re-substituting for y

86
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,150
using this expression.

87
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,020
So in terms of these variables, the AR1 model

88
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,160
takes a simple form.

89
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,700
Y sub t is a new random term.

90
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,820
Z sub t which would be all we'd have if it were random walk.

91
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,962
And if it's autoregressive of order 1,

92
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,420
we have a coefficient which here is

93
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,420
called minus lambda times the previous observation

94
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,180
Y of t minus 1.

95
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,230
If we're forecasting, it's helpful to shift our thinking

96
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,240
from looking backward to looking forward.

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,140
So let's just add 1 to t and write it

98
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,350
in this way, which is more a little bit more suggestive

99
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,240
if not more informative.

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,200
Let's say that Yt plus 1, the next observation we're

101
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,170
going to have is the next realization

102
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,470
of the random variable Z minus lambda times

103
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,318
the last known observation Y sub t.

104
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:53,710
Now, suppose we were to compute the conditional expectation

105
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,290
based on the information set available

106
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,630
at time t, which I'm going to denote

107
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,320
just I sub t for the information set.

108
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,980
In this case, it only consists of the past realizations of Y,

109
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,230
because those are the only variables in our problem.

110
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,530
But it might exist of a bunch of auxiliary financial or other

111
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,220
econometric variables.

112
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,190
So, in this case, what I wanted to do

113
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,370
is take an expected value assuming

114
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,570
that I know all of the realizations up through time t

115
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,600
so that Y sub t no longer a random variable.

116
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,990
But everything, Yt plus 1, Yt plus 2, Yt plus 3,

117
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,380
and so on into the future, those have not yet been observed

118
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,160
and they are random variables.

119
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,750
So exactly how I denote this is a matter of convention,

120
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,480
but and these are my conventions.

121
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,040
So hopefully the idea is clear.

122
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,400
Let's take a look at what the consequences are.

123
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,010
When I take expectations of both sides of the equation,

124
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,150
on the left-hand side I have the expectation of Y,

125
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,060
condition on the information set I sub t.

126
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,178
On the right-hand side the expectation of Z

127
00:05:57,178 --> 00:06:00,310
is 0 because it's the standardized random variable.

128
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,830
Its value, its expectation is always 0.

129
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,390
And this term now is a constant because it's already

130
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,420
been observed.

131
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,150
So it's expectation is just equal to itself.

132
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,860
So it's minus lambda times Y sub t.

133
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,220
How do we find the forecast or an expectation two steps

134
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,480
in the future?

135
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,500
We iterate.

136
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,640
So Y sub t plus 2 from the defining equation

137
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,270
for AR1 process, I can just take the previous equation

138
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,260
and write t--

139
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,230
the same way I replace by t plus 1, I'll replace t plus 1

140
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,490
by t plus 2.

141
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,080
So I have this defining equation Y of t plus 2 is Zt plus 2

142
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,750
minus lambda Yt plus 1.

143
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,720
Now, I'm going to substitute my previous equation

144
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,580
for Yt plus 1.

145
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,380
And I can-- just by substitution I can now express Yt plus 2

146
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,630
as Z of t plus 2 which is in the future, minus lambda of Zt

147
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,300
plus 1 which is also in the future,

148
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,380
plus lambda squared times Yt, which is a known quantity.

149
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,200
And now I'll stop.

150
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,210
Take expectations of both sides.

151
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,940
The first two terms vanish because they're Z's.

152
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,350
They have mean 0.

153
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,640
And the expectation for two steps ahead in our process

154
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,060
conditioned on the information available at time t

155
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,220
is equals a lambda squared Y sub t.

156
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,000
