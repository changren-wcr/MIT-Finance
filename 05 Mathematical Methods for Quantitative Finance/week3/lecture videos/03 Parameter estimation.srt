1
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:03,560
PROFESSOR: We use these to estimate parameters.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,230
So for example.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,643
In the random walk model that we wrote down,

4
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:07,560
we had two parameters.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,727
The generalized random walk, we had two parameters--

6
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:10,860
mu and sigma.

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,290
When we did Monte Carlo simulation,

8
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,780
we picked values of mu and sigma and generated

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,480
a bunch of concrete numbers on the computer.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,720
But suppose we start from data and we'd like to know.

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,200
What should we use for mu sigma if the data

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,260
were generated from, say, the random walk model.

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,940
What would be the right mu and sigma

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,500
that would correspondent that would have generated the data?

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,850
And the answer to that, we can find from usual statistics.

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,090
For maximum likelihood estimation, and in this case,

17
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,880
we find the mu from the average and the variance

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,890
from computing the sample variance

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,600
of our set of observations.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,240


21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,660
Now a quick aside on some things about doing financial returns

22
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,920
in particular, because that's the dominant case where we're

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,260
interested in finance where we're looking at time series

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,830
analysis.

25
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,290
The usual things that we would see in investment reporting

26
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,870
are going to involve simple returns--

27
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,440
simple returns, monthly returns, annual returns.

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,710
And variances or volatilities may be computed

29
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,000
using the simple returns.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,100
But often, mathematically, it's better

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,900
to work with logarithmic returns,

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,260
continuously compounded returns, rather than simple returns.

33
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,390
Now it's easy-- they're one-to-one

34
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,020
connected because the simple return is

35
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,720
just so I can exponentiate the logarithmic return

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,810
and subtract 1 and get the value that I need there.

37
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,778
And for a lot of applications, numerically, the values

38
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:43,820
are really, really close.

39
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,610
For example, if I'm looking at the equity markets

40
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,850
and I'm looking at returns over a one day time scale,

41
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,720
the numbers, the typical size of the returns, is very small.

42
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
And mathematically, these will be quite similar.

43
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,860
But if we want to do things right,

44
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,290
we need to use the correct formula.

45
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,270
These have exactly the same information.

46
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,400
And we can compute the expectations

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,000
by changing variables in whichever form is

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,600
more natural for us to compute.

49
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,210
To show you the point I made just a moment ago,

50
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,470
if we look at a Taylor expansion of big R in terms

51
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,740
of little r, of simple returns, in terms of log returns,

52
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,480
or if we turn it around the other way,

53
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,270
we can see that the leading order, big R and little r,

54
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,390
they're the same.

55
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,840
However, there are two things we want to keep in mind.

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,530
One of them is, deviations can be economically significant.

57
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,360
So if we take a look at things like a typical 10% return

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,473
with 30% volatility on an annualized basis,

59
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:42,890
if we look at the formulas, we can

60
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,020
see that there are deviations depending

61
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,092
on which of the formulas we use to compute them.

62
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,550
The other thing to keep in mind is,

63
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,860
this is great when the values are small, which

64
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,520
they are most of the time.

65
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,230
But when they're not, they're not.

66
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,070
So when we have a day like the stock market crash in October

67
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,410
of 1987 where the market fell by a quarter in a single day,

68
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,220
whether you're using logarithmic returns or simple returns

69
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,650
makes a big deal, and the higher order terms

70
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,400
in the Taylor series matter.

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,460
So it's always better to do it right.

72
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,560
In practice, we can sometimes get away

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,230
by not taking a look at the difference

74
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,885
depending on what the applications are.

75
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:22,760
When we're thinking about volatility, though,

76
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,910
and we'll see this when we get to the Black-Scholes equation

77
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,080
when we think about option pricing,

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,440
one of the important parameters in the model

79
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,020
is the volatility of the underlying.

80
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,490
And that is something that we need to estimate from data.

81
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,120
So what should we use for our estimator?

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,690
Our idea is that we ultimately need to have a good model.

83
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,530
So there are a lot of different possible ways of estimating.

84
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,690
And what we really want the real test

85
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,150
is whether the procedure that we use

86
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,480
produces good applications of the model that ultimately

87
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,440
fit the data in the markets properly.

88
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,650
The typical approach, though, is to use logarithmic returns, not

89
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,240
simple returns, because they're consistent with the formulation

90
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,810
of the model.

91
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,010
That is, within the option pricing models, as we'll see,

92
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,190
there's an assumption that the returns are log

93
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,020
normally distributed, or, in other words,

94
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,060
that the log returns are normally distributed.

95
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,540
If we start from the parameters of the price process,

96
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,580
that if we think of the price as being

97
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,785
the price from the previous day times the exponential

98
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:27,410
of some logarithmic return, and then we

99
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,330
think about iterating that, that's

100
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,760
consistent with our random walk model here.

101
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,343
Now the drift coefficient cancels out

102
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,760
of the definition of the variance.

103
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,760
But it is required for our estimation of the volatility.

104
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,390
Remember that computing the volatility or computing

105
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,488
variance requires looking at the deviations around the mean.

106
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:53,030
And the only mean that we have, we're

107
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,030
going to need to estimate from the data.

108
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,940
There are in the literature lots of alternative estimates

109
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,560
that have different benefits.

110
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,200
They have improved efficiency and they take into account

111
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,230
some things we might not see simply from looking

112
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,300
at close-to-close returns.

113
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,000
And a couple of them, like the Parkinson and Garman-Klass

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,930
estimators, take into account additional information that

115
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,250
sort of interpolates between the discrete observations that are

116
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,800
usually made for computing returns from the close of one

117
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,460
market day to the next, including, did the price--

118
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,420
where did it achieve a high or a low during the day, intraday,

119
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,750
and do we take into account the open, close, high,

120
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,250
and low during the day.

121
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,830
And that additional information can be helpful.

122
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,330
So ultimately, these are modeling choices

123
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,850
we need to see, but the starting point usually

124
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,150
is the traditional estimator that we looked at before.

125
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,850
Now when we look at hypothesis testing,

126
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,820
the simplest case is taking a model, like the random walk

127
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,410
model, and asking whether it's right or wrong.

128
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,320
So hypothesis testing is the simplest case.

129
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,190
We start with two hypotheses, a null hypothesis

130
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,970
and a alternate, and we define a test statistic

131
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,300
to see if we can reject the null hypothesis.

132
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,130
This test statistic is a random variable.

133
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,820
So we often do this probabilistically.

134
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,850
In classical statistical inference,

135
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,970
we think about a p-value or we look at a z-statistic.

136
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,760
And we say if the null hypothesis were true,

137
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,640
what's the likelihood that we would observe a test

138
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,910
statistic like this or that's this extreme or more.

139
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,760
That is, we look to see how small the p-value is

140
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,530
for evidence to reject the null.

141
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,420
And we compare it to some significance level

142
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,480
that we've hopefully agreed at in advance.

143
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,250
Because the test statistic is a random variable,

144
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,010
it's drawn from a probability distribution.

145
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,240
And if we have a lot of observations to make,

146
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,040
we can re-scale things so that it

147
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,430
looks close to a normal distribution or a related

148
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,690
distribution.

149
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,790
Just to keep in mind, a simple example

150
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,740
before we turn to the random walk--

151
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,810
imagine that we're flipping a coin

152
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,860
to see if it's a fair coin.

153
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,230
So we take a coin, we flip it 10 times,

154
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,660
and we observe a bunch of heads.

155
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,780
And we ask, is the coin fair or biased.

156
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,750
If we don't know in advance whether it's fair or biased,

157
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,330
we might imagine that there's a particular probability

158
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,440
of observing heads.

159
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,470
And we could ask, what's the value of p

160
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,600
and what's the best estimate for p.

161
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,300
And if we do have an estimate for the bias,

162
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,430
how precise is it, how much confidence do we have.

163
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,170
But simple hypothesis testing starts with two hypotheses--

164
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,870
H0, the null hypothesis that the coin is fair,

165
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,560
that the probability is 1/2, the alternate hypothesis that it's

166
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,450
anything other than 1/2.

167
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,270
Question to think about in any of these cases--

168
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,490
what are the appropriate test statistics

169
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,500
that we might choose from.

170
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,000
