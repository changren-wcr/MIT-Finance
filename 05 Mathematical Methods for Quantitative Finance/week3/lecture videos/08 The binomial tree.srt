1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,330
PROFESSOR: Let's look at another setting for random walks--

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,790
the binomial tree model that's used in option pricing.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,790
In the binomial model, in each discrete time step

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,520
a stock price, let's say an asset price,

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,170
can move only up or down to a particular fixed value.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,870
This sounds crazy, far away from reality.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,740
Stock prices can move anything, up or down in very small

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,520
increments.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,860
But in this model, we say there's only one thing

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,720
it can do going up or down.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,470
In typically in the model, we allow the movements

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,400
to be by the same percentage increase,

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,940
to have the same return in each time step,

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,050
so it's a stationary series.

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,130
So here's the structure of the model-- time goes to the right.

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,540
And in each column, so I start from this point here

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,550
and I've labeled all these nodes and I go either

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,290
to node 1 or node 2.

19
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,420
And then from each of these other nodes,

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,520
I have two choices as time evolves.

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,830
Here, I can go to either 4 or 5.

22
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,010
I can go up or down.

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,940
If I'm from 5, I can go to 8 or 9.

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,700
If I end up a terminal node 8, though, there

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,710
are a lot of ways I could have gotten there.

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,920
I could have gone 0, 1, 4, 8.

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,200
I could have gone 0, 2, 5, 8.

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,780
I could go 0, 2, 4, 8.

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,950
So if I want to know what the likelihood is to end up

30
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,030
at a terminal node of a particular value,

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,940
I can just add up all the possible ways

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,950
to get there, multiply times the probability of seeing

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,870
that particular path realized.

34
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,620
And that turns out to be essential for doing option

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,080
pricing and for managing risk.

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,730
But in terms of the basic model, we

37
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,250
recognize right away that's a random walk.

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,160
After all, we're taking steps, discrete steps,

39
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,790
in each time period.

40
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,850
And we're looking at the aggregate behavior

41
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,970
of those steps.

42
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,780
And we know that some of the large time properties

43
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,020
are related to the statistical distribution

44
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,610
of the sum of random steps.

45
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,830
So we do this in two steps, no pun intended.

46
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,440
We build the tree, we have a structure

47
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,750
for what the up and down moves represent.

48
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,450
Usually, we have a fixed return associated with up and down.

49
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,793
And that gives us a recombining tree,

50
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:18,210
where you notice there are two different ways to get, say,

51
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,260
to node 4.

52
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,800
Going up and down is the same as going down and up.

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
There are trees that don't necessarily recombine,

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,731
but in this case we'll keep the recombining tree.

55
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,320
And there are trees also that have multiple branches.

56
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,792
There are trinomial trees and multinomial trees.

57
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,500
But we'll do a look in the binomial tree.

58
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,590
So first we have the tree structure.

59
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,800
We assign to each branch a magnitude

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,540
by which the return changes, if we go up or if we go down,

61
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,910
and a probability of that happening.

62
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,220
Once we set up the tree structure,

63
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,760
we're ready to do some analytics and to price derivatives

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,380
on this tree, and also to take a look at in this structure

65
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,360
some very interesting possibilities

66
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,260
for exotic options and for different boundary conditions.

67
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,700
So the random walk process is the basis

68
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,060
of one approach to option pricing.

69
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,450
And it's obviously an extreme simplification of the dynamics.

70
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,300
But in the limit we actually end up

71
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,460
getting exactly the same result that we

72
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,140
do through continuous time approaches.

73
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,290
So in each time step the underlying

74
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,560
can either go up or down and we have uncertain payoffs.

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,260
Usually in this model, we think of having two assets--

76
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,680
one risky asset and a risk-free asset whose return

77
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,320
doesn't depend on where we are on the tree.

78
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,270
But one of the things we also need

79
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,300
to do to match this to reality is

80
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,220
take our abstract random walk and put some parameters on it.

81
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,060
We need to find out what the appropriate scales are.

82
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,990
And so we need to set the scales.

83
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,790
We need to decide on the returns.

84
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,040
We need to decide on the probabilities.

85
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,250
And that's going to tell us how this can map over

86
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,270
into the real world.

87
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,620
So here's an example of how we set up the structure.

88
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,950
We have a recursive behavior for a random walk where we say,

89
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,640
at each time step the new price, one step ahead,

90
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,750
is going to be the previous price, either times a number

91
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,620
I'll call u for an up move with probability p,

92
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,920
or a down move with probability 1 minus p.

93
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,480
That's one reason why I sometimes use

94
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,360
S instead of p for probability.

95
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,700
S we'll think of as stock price.

96
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,120
So the structure has this tree structure

97
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,100
here where, as I build things up,

98
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,590
I started this node with price S0.

99
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:44,500
With probability p I can go up and realize the price S0u.

100
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,520
If I go up again, the probability of going up and up

101
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,800
is p squared is my cumulative probability

102
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
to get to this point.

103
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,350
If I do so, the asset price with probability p squared

104
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,880
is going to be S0u squared.

105
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,810
Now I could end up if I have an up and down move,

106
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,030
I have two different ways of doing that.

107
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,470
Each of those ways has probability p times 1 minus p,

108
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,990
and I get this value, and similarly

109
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,250
for the downside of the tree.

110
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,600
And I can go at an arbitrary number of steps.

111
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,250
So what's the structure we expect?

112
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,190
Well, it's a binomial tree.

113
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,250
No surprise-- we find a binomial distribution.

114
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,020
The probability of observing a particular stock price

115
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,280
is equal to the probability of our binomial distribution

116
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,520
of the corresponding set of up and down moves.

117
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,760
So in this case if I have t time steps

118
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,220
and I need there to be k up moves,

119
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,770
I have t choose k ways of doing it.

120
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,190
They have probability p to the k, 1 minus p to the t minus k.

121
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,320
It's our old friend the binomial distribution.

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,280


123
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,270
Let's look at a concrete example.

124
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,460
Suppose u is equal to 2.

125
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,080
This is rather extreme.

126
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,100
Suppose in each time step the value of the stock doubles.

127
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,700
Suppose if I go down the value of the stock is cut in half.

128
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,760
Suppose the probability of an up move is 1/3,

129
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,880
the probability of a down move is 1/3.

130
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,190
Excuse me, probability of up is 2/3, probability of down move

131
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,090
is 1/3.

132
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,830
And let's suppose we have a starting price of 16.

133
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,230
So the tree looks like this.

134
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,720
16 with probability 2/3 doubles at time 1 to value 32.

135
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,540
And it can double again to value 64.

136
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,350
The probability of getting there at the end of two times steps

137
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,180
is 4/9.

138
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:41,270
The other terminal values at t equals 2 are 64, 16, and 4.

139
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,270
And that's it, it can't be anything else.

140
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,170
All right, so this is a very rigid model

141
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,420
of how stock prices could evolve and what

142
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,310
their terminal values are.

143
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,530
We can do some of the usual analytics.

144
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,720
For example, we could ask about the distribution

145
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,820
of stock prices at time t.

146
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,360
And here we have it.

147
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,560
So these are probability 4/9 to get a 64, probability 4/9

148
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,520
to get a 16.

149
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,770
Probability 1/9 to get a 4.

150
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,540
And that's it.

151
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,610
Now where it really gets interesting

152
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,280
is when we apply this to option pricing.

153
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:24,420
Now option pricing-- options are kind of a derivative.

154
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,420
And a derivative is a security whose value

155
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,310
depends on another security.

156
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,310
So you may be familiar with stock options,

157
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,300
and in particular call options that give you the right--

158
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,160
but not the obligation--

159
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:48,730
to buy security at a fixed price k for a call option,

160
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,520
but you would only exercise that if the market price is above k.

161
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,560
So if I tell you you have the right to buy a stock at $10,

162
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,920
you would not exercise that if the stock were $3.

163
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,410
You'd only exercise it if the price were more.

164
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,880
And then you could realize an immediate profit.

165
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,830
So if you have an option to buy a stock at a strike price

166
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,820
k equals $10, and at the time when the option is

167
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,440
about to expire if the stock price is $64, that means

168
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,130
you could buy it for 10 sell it for 64,

169
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,100
and have a profit of $54.

170
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,410
So no arbitrage tells us that if you

171
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,070
could make that $54 by doing that transaction,

172
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,880
then the value of the option should be $54.

173
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,690
So put options work similarly.

174
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,940
They give you the right but not the obligation

175
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,890
to sell at a fixed price.

176
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,710
You're not going to sell if you could get more money by selling

177
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,950
at the market price.

178
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,940
So put options are valuable if the price goes down.

179
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,650
Call options are valuable if the price goes up.

180
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,690
But in both cases, their value depends

181
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,990
quite asymmetrically on the value of the underlying,

182
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,590
on the value of the stock.

183
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,890
So a common structure that we see

184
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,810
in binomial trees as part of our approach to option pricing

185
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,960
is that first we set up the binomial random walks that

186
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,510
correspond to the stock price movement.

187
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,720
And then we look on the terminal nodes

188
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,960
out here in this example at t equals 2,

189
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,050
and assuming my option expires at t equals 2.

190
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,240
I look at the terminal nodes and I

191
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,030
say, what are the values of the options on the terminal nodes.

192
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,160
And they're determined by the value of the stock

193
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,400
on the terminal nodes.

194
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,010
So if the stock has value 64, 16, and 4,

195
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,880
then the value of a call option C at that point in time

196
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,470
could be 54 in the upper position with probability 4/9.

197
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,590
It could be 6 with probability 4/9,

198
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,660
because there are two ways of reaching it.

199
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,030
Or it could be 0, because we're not

200
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,150
going to buy a stock for $10 if we could buy it

201
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,920
by exercising our option--

202
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,360
if we could just throw away the option, it's valueless,

203
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,630
and we were to buy the stock on the market for $4.

204
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,080
Put options work in a complementary way.

205
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,540
And there's a property called put-call parity, which

206
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,190
you can see here in action.

207
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,140
Where when the risk-free rate is 0,

208
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,960
the value of a call minus the value of a put

209
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,530
is the value of the security minus the strike price.

210
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,590
So here we have the put is worthless

211
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,530
up here, because the stock is worth more than $10.

212
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,140
Here it's worthless stock is worth more than $10.

213
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,750
And down here it's worth $6, because we

214
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,635
could sell for $10 something that we could buy for $4.

215
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:42,120


216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,460
The tree becomes useful for more general kinds of problems,

217
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,460
and especially if we have different kinds

218
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
of boundary conditions.

219
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,690
So typically we're thinking for a vanilla

220
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,590
option that only expires at a particular point in time.

221
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,260
We go out and we look at the terminal nodes in the tree.

222
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,750
But we might have dividends that occur

223
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,200
at some intermediate point.

224
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,230
We might want to know at intermediate points

225
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,160
on interior nodes of the tree should we exercise the option.

226
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,380
Is it advantageous to do so?

227
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,620
There might be exotic options that if we

228
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,410
hit a particular node, if we go down too

229
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,040
far before we're going up, the option might become valueless.

230
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,990
Those are known as knock-out options.

231
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,570
And there are knock-in options that start valueless.

232
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,780
But if we hit a particular node, then they come to life.

233
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,950
And that splits.

234
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,080
It differentiates among the different paths.

235
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,880
We don't just group them together

236
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,190
and count the total number of combinatorics.

237
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,830
We need to separate those that might pass for a particular

238
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,550
node from those that don't.

239
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,990
So usual, it reduces to problems that we've already

240
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,910
seen in probability where we need

241
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,300
to classify different kinds of trajectories,

242
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,970
compute the probability of each, and then sum up

243
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,010
the ones that are of interest for the particular application.

244
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,700
Now to be able to connect with our previous model, what

245
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,830
we need to do is calibrate the tree.

246
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,530
We need to be able to connect parameters

247
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,110
on the tree with parameters of real-world stock prices.

248
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,590
So if we think of our stock price

249
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:17,730
as having a random walk with a logarithmic return

250
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,710
variable that takes binomial steps, in this notation,

251
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,350
if we think of r as being defined

252
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,950
as a logarithmic return, then in the binomial model

253
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,920
r would take two values, either the logarithm of u

254
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,060
so that e to the r multiplies St minus 1 by u,

255
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,730
or logarithm of D. So that's straightforward.

256
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:45,010
If we want to know how to implement our model

257
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,910
and we have a given u and D, this is how we do it

258
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,570
And we can also do it in terms of a typical Bernoulli-type

259
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,070
variable.

260
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,310
If we let x be 1 or 0, we can construct a variable.

261
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,800
Because it only has two states, it doesn't really

262
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,570
matter how we do it.

263
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,930
We can rewrite things for linear transformations

264
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,680
as long as there are two different states.

265
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Here, if I have a 1 and a 0, I can multiply something

266
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,190
and add something else.

267
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,090
And I can relate it to the log u and log D formulation.

268
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,250
So we can use different kinds of formulation.

269
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,850
The basic point is, it's a two-state model at each node.

270
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,690


271
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,390
So to connect this to real world asset values

272
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,910
and their returns and their volatilities,

273
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,150
we calibrate the model by taking expectations.

274
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,810
So we would calibrate mu to be the expectation

275
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,930
of r from the formulas that we had before.

276
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,840
And we compute sigma squared as the variance

277
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,510
by applying the definition and using

278
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,030
our usual results for things that

279
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,160
are constructed out of basic z.

280
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,360
So we put in the distribution of our binomial variables.

281
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,280
We have some extra parameters.

282
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,090
We compute.

283
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,180
And then what we're going to do is we have expressions now

284
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,190
for mu and sigma squared, which are things that we can estimate

285
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,770
and think about in terms of real-world asset

286
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,820
prices, their mean and their variance,

287
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,180
and we can connect them to model parameters

288
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,920
in the random walk, things that are the step size a and b,

289
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,830
the coefficients of the step formulation

290
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,560
in the Bernoulli form I just showed you and p

291
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,370
the probability.

292
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,840
So we can solve for a, p, and b in terms

293
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,000
of the up and down factors, for example.

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,720
And we can do that this over here to have a and b

295
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,120
in terms of those with mu and sigma.

296
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,910
And then we can express log u and log D

297
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,420
also in terms of mu and sigma so that if we

298
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,100
have particular real world values of mu and sigma, that

299
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,580
can tell us what u and D we can use on the model that

300
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,430
will give us something that will be

301
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,680
a discrete representation of the real-world drift and volatility

302
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,980
that we want.

303
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,380
Notice that the specification actually matches

304
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,060
different numbers and parameters, that in this case

305
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,520
we have two real world parameters, mu and sigma,

306
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,500
in terms of three model parameters, three unknowns.

307
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,000
