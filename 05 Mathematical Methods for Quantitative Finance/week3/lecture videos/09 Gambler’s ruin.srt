1
00:00:00,865 --> 00:00:03,240
PROFESSOR: There's a problem in the classical probability

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,820
literature known as Gambler's Ruin that's

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,640
a discrete time stochastic process that's

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,980
solved in a different way.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,960
And it would be interesting for us to take a look at it.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,690
So here's the idea.

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,960
The idea is, suppose that you and I are gambling.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,600
And we begin with the total amount of wealth,

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,680
total amount of assets.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,850
Let's call it a.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,890
And in this example on the right hand side,

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,680
imagine that there's $10 that we have between us.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,130
And we start with you have $5 and I have $5.

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,400
And the idea is, we play a sequence of games.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,150
At each step, if you win, you get $1-- if I win,

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,660
I get $1, the total amount of wealth is conserved.

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,090
And we play until one of us is ruined--

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,170
that is, until either your capital goes to 0 or mine does.

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,020
So from your perspective, either you get all the wealth,

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,160
or your wealth goes to 0, at which point it stops.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,350
Now, I've shown on the right a picture

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,070
that illustrates some possible ways this game might come out

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,630
with these starting conditions.

24
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,270
And each color represents a different path.

25
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,900
You'll notice that of the five paths that are shown here,

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,540
three of them finish with the player winning--

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,910
that is, capturing all $10 that are available.

28
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,420
One of them finishes with ruin--

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,250
that is at $0.

30
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,300
And then, it stays there.

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,940
Once you're ruined, you're not allowed to make any more bets.

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,920
And in the green path, one of them

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,870
has not yet hit either end.

34
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,430
It hasn't yet hit 0 or $10.

35
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,390
And we might even wonder if it could just

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,620
keep going indefinitely.

37
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,660
So in this kind of game, we have a repeated set of gambles.

38
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,160
And to keep it general, we're going

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,670
to allow the probability of success or failure--

40
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,460
our Bernoulli trials-- be asymmetric.

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,430
So let's let p represent the probability of success.

42
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,520
q is 1 minus p is the probability of failure.

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,390
You start with some initial capital, x greater than 0.

44
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,700
And we have these two classic stopping points,

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,820
which are either when you're capital x is equal to 0,

46
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,949
or x is equal to a.

47
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,760
Now, there are two kinds of things that this typifies--

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,680
two classes of problems, known as stopping

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,510
problems and boundary problems.

50
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,115
The boundary case is pretty obvious.

51
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:21,700
We have these two cases where our wealth either hits 0

52
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,970
or it hits a, at which point we stop.

53
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,450
So we can ask, unlike us unlike our previous case where

54
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,310
we looked at time series and just said,

55
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,810
you give initial conditions.

56
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,790
What happens in the future?

57
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,590
Here, we have boundary conditions

58
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,830
that specify something specific that occurs

59
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,270
if and when we hit them.

60
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,130
And of course, there are obvious financial applications.

61
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,140
These are things that represent bankruptcy, that's

62
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,390
the classic definition of ruin.

63
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,950
But they might be other events.

64
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,280
For example, hitting a capital reserve requirement,

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,210
hitting a credit default trigger, hitting your stop loss

66
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,500
limit.

67
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,290
And we could think of things on the upper limit as well.

68
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,160
We might have a strategy where we terminate an investment

69
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,530
once we reach a desired goal.

70
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,180
The stopping problems are a little bit different.

71
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,430
Those are cases where we want to know,

72
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,560
does a given process stop?

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,350
Does it ever reach the condition?

74
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,540
And if it does reach the condition, what

75
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,280
would be an expected time or what

76
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,740
would be the distribution of stopping times?

77
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,535
We might also think about this strategically.

78
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:27,910
We could have a question where we

79
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,350
ask, what would be the optimal way to say, run a business,

80
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,830
if we wanted to minimize its default probability

81
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,420
or its bankruptcy probability.

82
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,930
So let's look at the math and see how we can do this.

83
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,420
What we'll see is, we have a recursion relation.

84
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,430
But this recursion is not in time.

85
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,200
This recursion is in money.

86
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,760
So here's what we do.

87
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,280
Let's let q sub x denote the probability of ruin--

88
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,640
that is, the probability that we'll eventually hit 0

89
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,363
before x equals a, starting from an initial capital level x.

90
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:04,780
Now, the interesting thing here is

91
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,540
it does have a Markov structure, because it doesn't matter

92
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,920
what's happened in the past.

93
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,070
All the matters for our probability of surviving

94
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,050
is how much capital we have at the present time.

95
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,700
Probability is obviously conserved.

96
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,440
So the probability of ruin now we

97
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,930
can relate to what happens after our next game.

98
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,970
After the next game, we could win

99
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,110
with probability p, in which case

100
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,770
our capital would be x plus 1.

101
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,040
And that would give us p times qx plus 1.

102
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,320
Or we could lose and end up with capital

103
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,750
x minus 1, in which case, this would

104
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,340
be our probability of ruin.

105
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,620
And adding together these two mutually

106
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,790
exclusive possibilities gives us our original probability.

107
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,750
Now, you can see that this is a recursion relationship in x.

108
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,730
This kind of difference equation where

109
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,020
we have a relation between x minus 1, x, and x plus 1

110
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,690
is similar to differential equations

111
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,860
that are second order.

112
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,410
This is a second order difference equation.

113
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,330
Like the differential equation case,

114
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,620
there are two independent solutions.

115
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,380
And we fix the boundary conditions

116
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,460
by imposing-- we fix the final solution by imposing boundary

117
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,950
conditions on the general linear combination of the two

118
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,070
solutions.

119
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,920
So there's a special case when the probabilities are equal.

120
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,410
Let's do the general case.

121
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,160
In the general case, where p is not equal to q,

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,530
you can check by substitution that these

123
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,070
are two different solutions.

124
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,070
One of them is the trivial solution,

125
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,380
that q sub x equals 1.

126
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,190
And that's not an interesting solution to our problem,

127
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,860
saying the probability of ruin is equal to 1,

128
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,480
because we start out not being ruined.

129
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,360
But mathematically, leaving aside the boundary conditions,

130
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,120
it does solve this equation, because p plus q is equal to 1.

131
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,200
The other one is this form here, q over p to the x.

132
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,720
And remember, q is equal to 1 minus p.

133
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,160
And if you substitute this into the equation,

134
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,370
you can check that it works.

135
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,160
Now therefore, the most general solution

136
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,160
is a linear combination of these two special solutions.

137
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,420
So we have two constants.

138
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,920
Let's call them a and b.

139
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,620
So our general solution is of the form

140
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,580
constant plus another constant, times q over p to the x power.

141
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,660
And we fix a and b by imposing boundary conditions--

142
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,520
two obvious boundary conditions.

143
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,700
When x equals 0, we are ruined.

144
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,040
If we have no money, the probability of ruin

145
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,020
is 1, because we're already ruined.

146
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,630
And similarly, if we have all the money,

147
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,260
if our capital is equal to a, our probability of ruin

148
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,840
is 0, because the game is already ended.

149
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,440
So if we impose these, we can solve for a and b,

150
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,940
and we get this result for the probability of ruin--

151
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,370
this expression in the box down here.

152
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,090
This tells us, as a function of a, x, and p

153
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,480
what our probability of ruin is starting from any given

154
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,800
level of capital x.

155
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,600


156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,610
Now, we can ask a variety of questions

157
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,220
about what happens under these absorbing boundary conditions.

158
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,520
For example, we could ask, can the sequence

159
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,910
continue without terminating?

160
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,960
That is, does the probability of reaching neither x equals a

161
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,540
or x equals 0 in an arbitrary amount of time,

162
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,250
is that some positive number?

163
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,690
Is it equal to 0, which would mean

164
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,040
that we do hit one of the other two boundaries.

165
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,970
We could ask with the expected time is to hit.

166
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,090
If we allowed ourselves to stop differently,

167
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,970
what kind of strategy might we employ, and could we

168
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,050
do something better?

169
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,077
How do we take advantage of unequal odds?

170
00:07:47,077 --> 00:07:48,660
For the case where the odds are equal,

171
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,290
we can do it in one of two ways.

172
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,830
We can either check that 1 and x over a

173
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,960
are special solutions to the equation.

174
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,230
Or we can take the limit, where q approaches p,

175
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,200
using L'Hopital's rule and just taking our general solution.

176
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,010
What do we see about actual numerical values

177
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,370
to get some intuition about what's going on?

178
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,920
Well, one interesting fact about this,

179
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,510
is that if we start very close to taking all the money,

180
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,890
we have a good chance of winning.

181
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,970
Which isn't surprising.

182
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,600
For example, suppose that there's $100 between us,

183
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,780
and we start with $99, and we're playing the house.

184
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,700
And suppose the odds are equal, then

185
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,830
you can check by the previous formula,

186
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,980
we have a 99% chance of winning one more dollar

187
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,470
before we lose all 99% that we have.

188
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,429
Not surprising.

189
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,890
We're close to owning all of the money.

190
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,620
But what's less obvious, is that if the odds are against us,

191
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,540
we still have a very good chance of winning all the money

192
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,580
before we lose what we have.

193
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,700
That is, even when the odds are stacked against us,

194
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,120
if we have sufficient capital reserves, the odds

195
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,800
of attaining a finite goal--

196
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,230
and in this case, a relatively modest goal--

197
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,300
can look very attractive even when the odds are against us.

198
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,790
So the odds are against us, we typically

199
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,800
think it's a game that we shouldn't play.

200
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,530
The expected value's negative, stay away.

201
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,120
We want to look for opportunities

202
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,940
where we have positive expected value in a gamble.

203
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,550
And furthermore, where we give adequate compensation for risk.

204
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,970
If the expected return is negative,

205
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,340
normally we would say, let's leave it alone,

206
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,030
provided there are some other better opportunities available.

207
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,990
But all that changes when we limit our objective,

208
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,960
and we say, suppose I only want a fixed amount of money,

209
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,840
and I'm not going to play the game indefinitely.

210
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,240
In fact, we can go a bit further.

211
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,180
Not only does this sometimes give us

212
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,290
a positive chance for achieving a goal before we get ruined,

213
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,520
but it says, that when the odds are against us, sometimes

214
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,430
we should take even more risk.

215
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,740
What if we change the stakes?

216
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,280
Suppose we increase the bet size from 1 to b,

217
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,050
and let's suppose that b evenly divides a and x,

218
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,830
just for simplicity.

219
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,870
So if we change our bet size, then we update our recursion.

220
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,210
The problem has the same structure,

221
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,810
it's just the individual steps are chunkier.

222
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,430
When we substitute in--

223
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,470
we play the same game as before.

224
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,610
We solve for our formula, we get a new result. And what we find

225
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,200
is, that when the stakes are increased, that if the odds are

226
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,400
against us, we have a lower ruin probability-- that

227
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,190
is, a greater chance of winning all the money

228
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,890
and hitting the upper boundary, than we did before.

229
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,410
So if the odds are against you it

230
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,220
can be advantageous to swing for the fences, so to speak.

231
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,260
That is, you can think of this intuitively

232
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,720
as being kind of a complement to the law of large numbers.

233
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,570
In a game where we play indefinitely,

234
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,550
we know that our expected return is going to be negative.

235
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,300
We of course need to worry about the fluctuations.

236
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,830
But this says, that if there's a definite stopping point,

237
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,260
the fluctuations can be to our advantage

238
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,780
if we stop when we get a fluctuation that's

239
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,030
sufficient for us to hit our upper boundary.

240
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,880
That is, the longer we play, the more likely

241
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,220
we are to grind down and end up ruined.

242
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,590
But if we take larger bets, we're

243
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,420
more likely to have an instance where

244
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,020
we hit our upper boundary.

245
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,245
So lower ruin probability means greater overall chance

246
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:35,745
of success.

247
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:38,550


248
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,960
What if our appetite for risk is unbounded.

249
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,400
That is, suppose that a is infinite,

250
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
and we want to keep playing, and just

251
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,210
see how much money we could get.

252
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,217
Well, it's pretty clear that if the odds are unfavorable,

253
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,050
that we're never going to get all the money.

254
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,390
We've set ourselves an impossible task.

255
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:05,220
And in fact, our probability of ruin goes to 1.

256
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,050
In the case where the odds are in our favor,

257
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,390
we can compute what the ruin probability is

258
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,210
and get something potentially that's less than 1.

259
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,730


260
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,530
How long does the game last?

261
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,780
Well, we could ask about its expected duration

262
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,980
in the same way.

263
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,930
But now, things are slightly different,

264
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,480
because now we have a generalization

265
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,860
of our previous equation.

266
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,360
But now we have an inhomogeneous equation.

267
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,720
So let d be the duration of the game.

268
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,050
Then d of x plus 1 is the duration of the game,

269
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,720
starting from x plus $1.

270
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,470
And d x minus 1 is the duration of the game starting

271
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,000
from x minus $1.

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,740
And we need to find out d of x is,

273
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,600
that is, what's the expected return as a function of x.

274
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,010
So in our recursion, before we equated this to what's

275
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,360
on the left hand side.

276
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,970
But now, we know that these are related

277
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,910
to one more play of the game, so we add 1

278
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,600
on the right hand side.

279
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,020
So instead of the previous homogeneous equation

280
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,290
where every term involved the d, here we have this plus 1,

281
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,030
where you can check that this gives

282
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,550
a solution to the equation.

283
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,610
Here it's a slightly more complicated formula for p

284
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,160
not equal to q, for p equals q.

285
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,650
This simplifies it to a nice quadratic form.

286
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,630
a x minus x squared for p equals q.

287
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,830
So that tells us, that for example,

288
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,440
in a fair game, if you and I each start with $100--

289
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,250
$200 total, the expected duration of the game

290
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,635
is 10,000--

291
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:42,630
100 times 100.

292
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:48,960
And it grows as the square when the stakes are equal.

293
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,740


294
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,320
So let's summarize.

295
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,270
Gambler's Ruin is a problem which

296
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,070
has a recursive structure.

297
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,180
It's a discrete time process in money rather than in time.

298
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,310
And it's subject to boundary conditions.

299
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,880
The boundary conditions tell us when the process terminates.

300
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,850
It's got applications to gambling, obviously,

301
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,270
to insurance where the ruin problem in the insurance

302
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,930
literature is finding the probability that you have

303
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,500
adequate capital to never get ruined

304
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,340
by random processes which represent

305
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,670
the arrival of insurable claims or losses.

306
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,910
It has applications to thinking about bankruptcy likelihood,

307
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,080
credit default, and to bet sizing in investment strategies

308
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,480
or in gambling strategies.

309
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,850
The stopping problems that we consider

310
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,700
are things that could be defined by economic conditions,

311
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,970
such as a company in distress, beating

312
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:55,480
a particular term in a covenant, or a bank loan being called

313
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,310
subject to certain terms.

314
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,370
We can think about optimal stopping problems, where

315
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,310
we might have different kinds of objective functions

316
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,710
rather than maximizing expected return,

317
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,950
rather than thinking of maximizing Sharpe ratio,

318
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,450
we might think of a business venture

319
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,800
where what we'd like to do as business owners, and investors,

320
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,170
and entrepreneurs is, sure, we might

321
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,910
like to maximize our profit.

322
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,650
But maybe what we'd really like to do

323
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,340
would be to maximize the lifetime of our business

324
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,370
or minimize the probability that we go bankrupt.

325
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,500
And those will not be exactly the same calculation.

326
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,000
