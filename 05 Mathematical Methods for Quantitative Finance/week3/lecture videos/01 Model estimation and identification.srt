00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,680
PROFESSOR: Models we study for applications in finance

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,000
are not just mathematical constructs,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
they're tools that we use as approximations to reality

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,250
and that we use for interpreting data and understanding

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,490
the world around us.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,460
Now in finance, the problem we have

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,890
is quite different from that we have in the physical sciences,

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,520
even though some of the mathematical tools

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,200
are quite similar.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,630
Rutherford once said that if your experiment needs

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,750
statistics, you should have done a better experiment.

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,810
But in finance, we're really quite different from laboratory

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,720
sciences.

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,260
Most of our data is noisy.

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,435
We need statistics, we need tools

16
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:40,560
to get to the bottom of it.

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,560
Furthermore, we can't repeat an experiment,

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,480
not in a true laboratory sense.

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,060
Actually, we have an interesting dichotomy.

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,610
We've got on the one hand, that we often

21
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,100
deal with market data and historical market data.

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,500
And that is almost by definition reproducible.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,117
If we plug-in the same numbers, we

24
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:58,950
should get exactly the same answer no matter

25
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,450
who does the calculation.

26
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,660
That's a good reason why it's interesting exercise

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,519
to pick up previously published papers

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,530
and work and reproduce their results.

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,360
Unlike a laboratory result, you should

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,220
be able to get exactly the same thing if you

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,680
can get your hands on the same historical market

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,250
data on which some empirical studies were based.

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,320
On the other hand, markets change.

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,910
We can't go back in time.

35
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,420
And all of our results are going to generally be provisional.

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,800
So this leads to a different perspective on modeling,

37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,680
and often to the difficulty in settling questions.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,240
And one that we'll take a look at

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,300
is going to be the role of the random walk

40
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,910
model and the so-called random walk hypothesis.

41
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,150
What does it say and can we test it?

42
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,090
More generally when we're looking at models,

43
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,148
we have a bunch of questions that we want to ask.

44
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,690
And I'll talk about a few of them now

45
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,440
and will develop more of them over the course of this lecture

46
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,950
and beyond.

47
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,540
We'd really like to know would be,

48
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,760
what's the model that generates the data that

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,340
determines how prices move, how variables evolve and so on.

50
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,360
But nobody tells us that there is such a thing.

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,720
There might not be such a thing.

52
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,550
If there is, it might change and we can't look it up in a book

53
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,752
exactly.

54
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:15,210
What we're typically faced with when it comes to real world

55
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,840
problems is data, and maybe a whole bunch of different models

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,080
and some candidate models.

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,710
So the questions we ask includes these, and not

58
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,670
necessarily in this order.

59
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,790
What's the model that best fits the data?

60
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,470
If we have a choice of models.

61
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,020
If the models have adjustable parameters,

62
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,200
how should we find the best values for those parameters?

63
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,540
How do we decide among the better of two models?

64
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,230
It might have a different number of adjustable parameters.

65
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,030
Do the models of a stationarity?

66
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,900
That is, do they describe the evolution

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,600
of our variables of interest in a way

68
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,150
that the models themselves don't change over time?

69
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,310
That is the probability distributions

70
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,310
are stationary over time, the so-called time's translation

71
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,950
invariance.

72
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,960
How should we be estimating our parameters?

73
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,450
How can we take a look at what's going on with data?

74
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,013
Before we build models and test them,

75
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:10,680
we might want to take a look at the data

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,440
and see if there's some general attributes that

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,020
suggest the kind of models that might or might not

78
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,900
be appropriate.

79
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,320
So we often do some initial exploration.

80
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,140
And sometimes we do this with the same statistical tools

81
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,030
that show up in other settings as well.

82
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,390
We often want to test hypotheses.

83
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,430
Is this model correct or is it not?

84
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,290
That's our simplest version.

85
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,680
Or if we have a bunch of models, which of the models

86
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,970
is the best?

87
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,000
And finally, we'll take a look when

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,730
we look at structured models of information propagation

89
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,600
in time series models as to how we can decide about what

90
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,370
the appropriate correlation links are,

91
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,340
what the distances are, what the order and class

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,970
of an appropriate model is.

93
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,340
There's not always an easy answer.

94
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,910
So let's review for a moment, just a couple of the basics.
