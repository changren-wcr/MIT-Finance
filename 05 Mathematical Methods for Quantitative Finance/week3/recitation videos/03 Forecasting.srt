1
00:00:00,943 --> 00:00:02,610
PROFESSOR: Let's talk about forecasting.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,340
We saw in lecture that forecasting

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,580
is an application of conditional probability to time series

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,430
models.

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,420
So we think of the time series as generating the data.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,550
And we ask at a given point in time,

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,240
given all the observations that exist up

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,410
through that point in time, what can we say about the future?

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,170
We might want to know what happens one time step ahead,

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,380
two time steps ahead, or in limit

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,940
as the number of times that goes to infinity,

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,650
but the key thing is the break between past and future.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,610
So we take the present time to be just after we've

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,260
made our final observation.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,650
And we're first forecast period is one step ahead.

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,470
And, as I said, the key tool is in addition to

17
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,210
our previous ones with expectations,

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,300
linearity, algebraic substitution, recursion.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,860
We had a new one, which is conditional probability.

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,430
In this setting, conditional probability simply

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,820
means that for any variable that was

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,630
a random variable in the past that has been realized,

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,260
it's no longer a random variable.

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,150
Now it's a scalar.

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,570
Now it's a number.

26
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,110
So those things that show up in the recursion

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,690
that we previously thought of as random variables,

28
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,170
in this setting, when we take conditional expectations

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,770
of our defining equations or equations of evolution,

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,910
then they take a different character,

31
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,160
because they're already known.

32
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,750
They're no longer random variables.

33
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,810
So we looked at an example in lecture.

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,390
Let's just do a couple of examples together.

35
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,540
It's the same structure.

36
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,540
They're just one or two things it might be worth

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,880
paying attention to as you look at the blind forecast

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,070
of your own.

39
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,570
Some of the things that might have look special for the case

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,550
of the AR 1 are quite general.

41
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,110
So let's take a look at a model.

42
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:57,585
Let's look at, say, an AR MA 1, model, AR MA 1,

43
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:01,840
1, which is this form.

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,710
Let's say that Xt is equal to a constant C0 plus C1 X

45
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,580
the previous 1 plus a bunch of Z's.

46
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,220
So I'm going to keep the notation sigma

47
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,760
Zt for our shock for innovation in the period.

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,100
You could give it another name for its coefficient.

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,660
Remember that sigma, in this case,

50
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,300
is not the standard deviation of x.

51
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,480
It's just a scaling parameter for the random shock z.

52
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,620
And then we'll call this phi 1 Zt minus 1.

53
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,570
So the first thing we'd like to do

54
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,650
is compute the mean value for x and simplify our expression.

55
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,980
So we use our usual trick.

56
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,290
Mu is the name will give the expectation of Xt.

57
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,930
And then we take expectations on the right hand side

58
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,760
and apply linearity.

59
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,975
So we have this is going to be C0 plus C1 expectation of X

60
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:03,680
t minus 1, but we know that that is just

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,760
the same thing as C1 times mu.

62
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,820
And then we're going to have plus 0 plus 0,

63
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,440
because the Z's have 0 expectation.

64
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,890
So we have the result that mu is going to be equal

65
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,250
to C0 over 1 minus C1.

66
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,780
And you should recognize that expression from our AR 1 model.

67
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,860
It's exactly the same expression.

68
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,810
And therefore, we can substitute and rewrite our equation

69
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,390
as a bunch of things that are grouped together in such a way

70
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,680
that they all have 0 mean.

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,770
That is to say, if I substitute for C0

72
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,490
and say it's equal to mu times 1 minus C1,

73
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,990
then I can write this as Xt--

74
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,112


75
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,940
let's keep our colors consistent here--

76
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,740
Xt minus mu--

77
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,870
I can put this on either side of the equation,

78
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,620
depending on what I'd like to do--

79
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,100
but just for looking at the structure of the model,

80
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,930
I'll right this is Xt minus 1 minus mu

81
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:13,300
plus sigma Zt plus phi 1 Z of t minus 1.

82
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,250
Now the next thing we want to do is put things

83
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,850
in forecasting form.

84
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,170
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to shift t to t plus 1.

85
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,500
Everywhere where I see a t, I'm going to write t plus 1.

86
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,440
And that puts the future values on the left

87
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,020
and the present and past values or the known

88
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,100
values on the right hand side.

89
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,810
So for one-time step ahead, this makes exactly the split

90
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,080
that we want to have.

91
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,120
So what I'll do is-- let me just write this as Xt plus 1.

92
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,000
Here I can put the mu on the right hand side if I like.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:54,400
And this is going to be C1 of Xt minus 2 plus sigma Zt plus 1

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,090
plus phi 1 and Z.

95
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,820
So notice that in our original description,

96
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,490
in our terms of our original coefficient

97
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,140
C1 was a reminder that it matched the lag 1x variable.

98
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,160
And phi 1 was a reminder that it matched lag 1 Z variable.

99
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,700
If we had C2, C3, and phi 2, phi 3, phi 4,

100
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,730
those would have matched the corresponding lags of the Z's,

101
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,710
but what really matters are the relative amounts.

102
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,060
So when I add 1 to everything, there's no surprise

103
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,100
or there shouldn't be the C1 now gets

104
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,050
multiplied by Xt without a lag and similarly with phi 1.

105
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,820
So that's here.

106
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,690
So what's our forecast?

107
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,380
So our definition for our forecast

108
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,820
is going to be the conditional probability.

109
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,220
So our first forecast is going to be f of t comma 1.

110
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,150
That is the forecast made at time t for one-time step

111
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,600
ahead in the future.

112
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,660
And there are different notations for this.

113
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,510
So what you really should rely on is not the notation,

114
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,920
but reduce everything to expectations.

115
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,830
So this is the expectation of t plus 1 given everything

116
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:15,690
up through that point, which includes Xt, Zt,

117
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,250
and any previous failures, but those

118
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,050
don't show up in this equation on the right-hand side.

119
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,930
So let's compute the expectation.

120
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,540
And what we noticed is that the only random variable

121
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,090
on the right hand side is this one.

122
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,010
That's the only thing that's random.

123
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,680
So this value here is known.

124
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,570
This value here is known.

125
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,250
There's only one random variable.

126
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,550
And we take expectations, the expectation of t plus 1

127
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,820
is going to vanish.

128
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,990
So what do we get?

129
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:47,540
We're going to get that the forecast is equal to--

130
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,190
we'll leave this here--

131
00:06:49,190 --> 00:07:02,490
is going to be mu plus C1 times Xt minus mu plus phi 1.

132
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,580


133
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,570
So we just do the calculation.

134
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,610
It's exactly the same as the expression

135
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,990
above, except for this term, this random term

136
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,450
that dropped out, because it has zero expectation.

137
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,120
So let's take a look at the forecast error.

138
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,510
So the first forecast error for one-time step

139
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:32,350
ahead is going to be, e is going to be f,

140
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,612
or actually it's going to be the outcome, excuse me,

141
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:35,820
but we're going to square it.

142
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,090
So it won't matter.

143
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:44,240
The error is going to be X t plus 1 minus f t comma 1.

144
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,910
That is the forecast error as defined

145
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,190
as the difference between what we predicted

146
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,350
and what actually happened.

147
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,510
What we'd like to do and the way in which

148
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,390
we have this definition for the forecast being optimal

149
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,510
is we're going to minimize the mean squared forecast error.

150
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,920
That is going to minimize the square of e

151
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,920
in expectation of all possible things that would happen.

152
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,710
Now we could use other kinds of loss functions.

153
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,540
Those will depend on the settings,

154
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,290
depending on the economic values.

155
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,090
So it's just a question of doing and minimization,

156
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,533
but in this case, we have this basic result

157
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,950
that this will be our expectation,

158
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,980
but let's compute the forecast error.

159
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,690
So the idea is that what we really want, in general, if you

160
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,420
want to drive this and check, what we really want

161
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,130
is we want a predictor for f, that some function of all

162
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,460
the previous observations, in this case, just Xt and Zt,

163
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,330
we'd like to be a linear function.

164
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,720
And when we find the linear function that

165
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,030
minimizes the mean squared error,

166
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,830
we find that it's this conditional expectation.

167
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,698
So let's compute this quantity.

168
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:50,990
And we'll see that there's a really nice structure that

169
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,890
shows up.

170
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,820
Xt plus 1 minus the forecast, you

171
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,000
notice that most of the terms are common.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:09,140
So Xt plus 1 involves this term and this term.

173
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,080
Xt plus 1 involves-- this is the only term that

174
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,640
doesn't appear in ft 1.

175
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,300
So when I take this quantity and I subtract this quantity given

176
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,850
down here, I've got a very simple result.

177
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:29,900
This is just equal to sigma z plus 1.

178
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,830
And therefore, the mean squared forecast error

179
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:43,340
is Et plus 1 squared is equal to the expectation of sigma

180
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,980
Zt plus 1 quantity squared.

181
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,730
And that's just equal to sigma squared.

182
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,950


183
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,980
Now what about looking at multiple forecasts?

184
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,180
So we'd like to go for future horizons.

185
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,880
One-step was easy.

186
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,310
So the general rule is that when we

187
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,980
want to do it two-step ahead forecast,

188
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,343
we're going to shift everything.

189
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,510
We're going to add one more.

190
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,330
So we write an expression for X of t

191
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,190
plus 2, but now on the right hand side,

192
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,760
I've got 2 plus 1, which isn't known yet.

193
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,950
So here's the general procedure.

194
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,690
Keep doing the recursion.

195
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,850
Keep substituting in back until all of the X's on the right

196
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,320
hand side of the equation have a time index of t or earlier.

197
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,203
The Z's can be later.

198
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:35,620
That's OK, because we're going to take their expectations,

199
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,950
and they're going to vanish.

200
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,610
So we might have some possibly unknown Z's.

201
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,660
But the basic idea is once we go beyond one-time step,

202
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,230
how do you know what to do?

203
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,550
It's easy.

204
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,030
You're doing Xt plus h for horizon h

205
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,290
on the left hand side.

206
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,710
And on the right hand side, you do probably h or h

207
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,690
minus 1 recursive substitutions of the defining equation

208
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,890
until we can express Xt plus h in terms of X, Xt

209
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,300
minus 1, and so on.

210
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,190
Those are all known quantities.

211
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,560
Then we take conditional expectations.

212
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,940
We have our forecast.

213
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,830
We compute the forecast errors.

214
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,080
We take expectations of their squares.

215
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,600
That's easy as well, because it's just the same quantities.

216
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,070
Now we have the known and the unknown ones

217
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,600
clearly delineated.

218
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,370
And we get our results for our mean squared forecast error.

219
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,370
And there are two really important properties

220
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,030
to keep in mind for our solution.

221
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,880
One of them is the forecast error has zero expectation.

222
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,790
And the forecast error is orthogonal

223
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,775
to the other variables, to the other random variables--

224
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:43,240


225
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,270
excuse me, to the other predictor variables.

226
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,220
So let's take a look for another example

227
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,800
Let's take a look at an AR MA 2, 2 model, shall we?

228
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:04,190
So now when you're given numbers for the forecasts

229
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,970
or particular horizons, you can either plug them in right away

230
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,320
or you can leave the parameters general.

231
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,620
That generally makes it easier to check your math

232
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,320
and find any sign errors that might be there,

233
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,750
but either way, whether you substitute indefinite numbers

234
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,300
for the parameters before or after shouldn't

235
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,365
make any difference.

236
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,990
When you're doing forecast, you do want to pay attention though

237
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,530
to the initial conditions if you have to bootstrap your process,

238
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,610
because if you're asked for a forecast one or three

239
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,850
or seven steps ahead, you'll need enough data to get

240
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,910
the process started before you can generate the recursion.

241
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,780
The recursive techniques that we have

242
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,470
that I'm writing down here for the forecast

243
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,120
are technically appropriate for the case, where we go

244
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,040
infinitely far into the past.

245
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,860
Even if the series did exist an infinitely long time,

246
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,000
we wouldn't have an infinite amount of data.

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,660
So we do need to make sure we have the initial conditions set

248
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,230
to get numerical answers, but the basic rules are compute

249
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,040
conditional expectations after writing our defining

250
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,960
equations with variable to be forecast on the left hand side

251
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,060
and only known observations on the right hand side.

252
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,850
So let's do this for AR MA 2, 2.

253
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,880
So it just has--

254
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,870
it's little bit more complicated at least initially.

255
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:29,570
So it looks like C0 plus C1 Xt minus 1 plus C2 Xt minus 2

256
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,390
plus our old friend sigma Zt.

257
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:38,870
And now let's add some phi terms plus phi 1, Z of t minus 1

258
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,920
plus phi 2, Z of t minus 2.

259
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,957
And you can see how it would go for a general ARMA PQ.

260
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,540
I'm going to write it in concrete form

261
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,332
so we don't have summations running around.

262
00:13:49,332 --> 00:13:51,410
And when we shift, it gets a little messy

263
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,480
keeping track of the indices, but you can do it.

264
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,938
And you can take a look at the literature as well for that.

265
00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:58,050
So what's our expectation in this case?

266
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:03,410
So mu is the expectation of Xt.

267
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:11,360
And now that's going to be C0 plus C1 mu plus C2 mu.

268
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,700
And that tells us that mu is actually

269
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:23,130
equal to C0 divided by 1 minus 1 minus 2.

270
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,930
And you can guess how this generalizes

271
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,790
for the general ARMA PQ model, we

272
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,140
get the generalization of this expression.

273
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,020
And then we can write our equation

274
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:42,950
as Xt is equal to C1 of Xt minus 1 minus mu

275
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,670
plus C2 Xt minus 2 minus mu.

276
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,560
And we start to recognize some patterns.

277
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,110
And we get the hang of it, plus phi 1 Ct minus 1

278
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,100
plus phi 2 Ct minus 2.

279
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,470
And let's not forget our sigma, Zt, which we can put over here,

280
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,240
let's do some forecasting, shall we?

281
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,660
Oh, excuse me, this should also have on the left hand side,

282
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:18,370
this should be Xt minus mu.

283
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,470
You should notice that each of the terms that I've

284
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,918
written down is a way that it has 0 mean.

285
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:25,210
That just makes it a bit easier to see what's going on,

286
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,510
to see what the dynamics are, and to do some calculations.

287
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,390
You can also, if you want to clean it up,

288
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,370
you can find a new variable y to be Xt minus mu and shift things

289
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:34,870
back.

290
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,880
So you can do any rescaling things you like.

291
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,213
The end results are going to be the same if they're just

292
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:41,960
redefinitions of the parameters and rescalings

293
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,790
of the variables.

294
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,800


295
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,630
So let's take a look for time T plus 1.

296
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,950
So for time T plus 1 minus mu, we're

297
00:15:53,950 --> 00:16:08,950
going to C1 of Xt minus mu plus C2 of Xt minus 1 minus mu

298
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:21,890
plus sigma Zt plus 1 plus phi 1 Zt plus phi 2 Zt minus 1.

299
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,610
So that one is pretty easy.

300
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,560
It looks like the expression that we just

301
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,980
did before for the AR MA 1, 1.

302
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,180
That is everything on the right hand side has an index of--

303
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,260
all of the X's are taken at time T or T minus 1.

304
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,150
And the Z's are mostly in the past.

305
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,180
We have these two with coefficients

306
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,650
of phi's both in the past.

307
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,280
And this is the only one that's still a random variable,

308
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,350
but at time 2, things change.

309
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,230
So let's look one more time step ahead.

310
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,360
Let's contrast a little bit.

311
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,810
So if we write this as Xt plus 2 minus mu,

312
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:06,380
we see that we have C1 Xt plus 1 minus mu.

313
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,910
And that is going to be something

314
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,980
we're going to need to replace.

315
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,569
And then plus the other terms are not

316
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,250
going to give us any major problems.

317
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:20,880
And this is going to be Ct times Xt minus mu plus sigma

318
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:31,980
plus T plus 2 plus phi 1 Zt plus 1 plus phi 2 Zt.

319
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,450
So all I've done is I shifted T to T plus 1 again.

320
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,420
And the terms that are in orange are the things that--

321
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,240
well, let me put the other one in orange-- so a little

322
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,390
more consistent.

323
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,925
So let's put in orange things that pertain to the future.

324
00:17:49,925 --> 00:18:06,110


325
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,310
So I have two of the terms on the right hand side

326
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,740
involve the present or the past.

327
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,430
And that's OK.

328
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,220
Those are known quantities, but I have these other expressions.

329
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,090
So I can't just directly compute the expectation

330
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,030
on the left hand side.

331
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,390
Now I could take the previous work I did before

332
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,050
and substitute that would be fine.

333
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,410
But if I want to see the general approach for doing it

334
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,020
at a particular time step, what I'm going to say

335
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,060
is that the expressions here and here, I can leave alone,

336
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,440
because those are both fine.

337
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,940
These just involves Z's.

338
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,370
And I know their expectations, but I

339
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,530
don't want the recursive structure for Xt

340
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,100
plus 1, because remember this is saying that the value two

341
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,250
days from now depends on the value tomorrow, which

342
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,060
I haven't yet observed.

343
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,650
So the value today, the value yesterday, those are all known,

344
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,480
but rather than expressing it this way,

345
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,620
I'd like to do my recursions, get it out.

346
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,210
And then I can take clean ordinary simple expectations

347
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,370
and get an answer.

348
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,640
So let's do that.

349
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,150
And we just need to substitute one more time and put that in.

350
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,180
So which term are we going to substitute--

351
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,910
we're going to substitute in?

352
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:19,700
We'll have Xt plus 2 minus mu is going

353
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:26,840
to be C1 times this entire expression above.

354
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,020
So let's just write that out.

355
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:37,130
This is going to times C1 Xt minus mu plus C2.

356
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,060


357
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,320
Xt minus 1 minus mu and so on.

358
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,730


359
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:58,000
Sigma Zt plus 1 plus phi 1 Zt plus phi 2 Zt minus 1.

360
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,600


361
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:09,580
And then plus the other terms, plus C2 Xt minus 2

362
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:22,530
plus sigma Zt plus 2 plus phi 1 Zt plus 1 plus phi 2 Zt.

363
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,090
So what have we got?

364
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,540
We finally have an expression, where--

365
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,725
and actually, let's do one more thing.

366
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:32,460
Let's just kick mu to the other side of the equation.

367
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:42,180


368
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,485
So I now have an expression for X of t

369
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:47,160
plus 2, where on the right hand side,

370
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,950
everything depends on known quantities.

371
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,920
So we put it in.

372
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,030
We turn the crank.

373
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,470
We compute the expectation two-time steps ahead.

374
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:03,200
That will give us our forecast today for two-time steps ahead.

375
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,290
When tomorrow is realized, that forecast

376
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,920
for what will then be one more day ahead is going to change.

377
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,970
And how will it change?

378
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,770
It will be updated by the new observation.

379
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,370
So if today is Monday and I'd like

380
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,320
to know about Wednesday's weather,

381
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,150
I would make a forecast today.

382
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,545
Tomorrow I'll have a new forecast for Wednesday.

383
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:23,420
And that will change.

384
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,200
It will change by my knowledge of what happened on Tuesday.

385
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,270
But from a mathematical point of view,

386
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,450
we separated things into the form that we want.

387
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,490
We can first take the expectation

388
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,140
with the appropriate conditions.

389
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,010
And second, we can compute forecast error in advance.

390
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,560
And we can compute the mean squared forecast

391
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,060
two steps ahead.

392
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,400
And so that's looking ahead for what

393
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,540
our expected forecast error.

394
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,390
The reason that that's important is

395
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,330
that we want to think not only about distributions.

396
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,620
What's the exact value?

397
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,080
Because that exact value probably won't be realized.

398
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,490
It gives us characteristics of the full distribution

399
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,010
of the actual outcome.

400
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,320
And it lets us have a sense as to how we

401
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,030
should evaluate our forecasts.

402
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,400
So that's an expectation.

403
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,640
Once Wednesday is realized, then we'd like to go back.

404
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,000
And then our Xt plus 2 will be a known quantity.

405
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,990
We can compare it with our forecast.

406
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,990
And, of course, this will differ by some amount,

407
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,480
but if we'd like to improve our forecasting techniques,

408
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,600
our forecasting methodology, and our forecasting quality,

409
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,070
what we do is we look over time.

410
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,520
We take a large collection of forecasts and outcomes.

411
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,680
And we study the statistics of the forecast errors.

412
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,270
So we use forecast errors both in expectation going forward

413
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,510
and to assess forecast quality and look

414
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,150
for improvements going backward once we've

415
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,690
collected the relevant data.
