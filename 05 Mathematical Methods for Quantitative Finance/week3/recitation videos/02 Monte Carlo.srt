1
00:00:00,946 --> 00:00:03,610
PROFESSOR: We saw in lecture how to use Monte Carlo

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,340
techniques to simulate price paths,

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,980
for example, for asset prices.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,950
For example, behind me I have some sample prices

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,660
for a stock that might follow a log-normal process.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,810
That is, its logarithmic returns are normally distributed.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,240
And the parameters over here are that I have 252 time steps.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,520
I have 10,000 simulations of which

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,290
I have plotted the first 10.

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,600
I have an initial price of $100.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,120
I have a mu of 0.6.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,580
And I've got a sigma of 0.42.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,932
So this shows a particular set of realizations.

14
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:46,640
But there's more than we can do than just

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,740
look at pretty pictures.

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,360
Monte Carlo methods give us a powerful approximation tool.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,090
And they give us some direct computation tools when

18
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,680
it comes to derivative pricing.

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,330
So how are they a powerful computation tool?

20
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,870
Well, if we know the exact probability distribution,

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,910
then if we want to compute some expectations of operators,

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,110
we end up doing some intervals.

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,790
So even for something as simple as the Gaussian distribution,

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,640
we might be interested in some transforms, some exponentials,

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,003
some other complex functions.

26
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,170
We'd have to do a bunch of Gaussian integrals, which

27
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,760
is fine if you like integrals.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,210
But there's another way to do it,

29
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,470
which is we can simulate price paths on the computer,

30
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,450
and then we replace the exact expectation operator,

31
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,130
the mathematical operator, where we

32
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,400
take a probability weighted average of our function

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,760
or variable of interest.

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,770
And we replace it by an average, just an ordinary arithmetic

35
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,990
average, of the quantities that are

36
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,780
observed within our ensemble.

37
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,930
What makes this work is the fact that all of our paths

38
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,590
are equally likely.

39
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,610
So we don't need to write down the explicit probability

40
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,850
measure.

41
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,700
What we do is we generate the paths

42
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,580
because each one is as likely to be drawn as any other.

43
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,320
The weights will come up, and they will

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,900
sample the probability measure.

45
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,380
And they'll sample the space with appropriate weights

46
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,460
and appropriate frequencies.

47
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,480
So this is a very good approximation technique

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,790
for problems where it might be difficult to do

49
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,460
the integrals in closed form, or we might not even

50
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,060
have an explicit expression for the probability measure.

51
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,240
There are two things to keep in mind regarding the accuracy,

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,260
and you should try out these examples.

53
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,150
So there are things on problem sets.

54
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,400
But you should go beyond that.

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,990
Try changing the parameters.

56
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,230
In particular, two things to take a look at to

57
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,450
see how they affect the accuracy--

58
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,270
one of them is the number of simulations.

59
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,300
I typically use 10,000 pounds to start

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,380
with because in general, the accuracy of the result

61
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,000
goes like 1 over the square root of the number of paths.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,020
So if I have 10,000 paths, that should give me things

63
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,740
that are accurate to around 1%.

64
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,380
What's more important-- the number might be different,

65
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,060
but the scaling is important.

66
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,640
If I want to get it 10 times better,

67
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,340
I need to do 100 times more simulations.

68
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,480
If I do only 1/100 of the number of simulations,

69
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,690
my answers are going to degrade by a factor of 10.

70
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,120
The other thing that you might want to experiment with,

71
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,490
though, is the size of the time step.

72
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,240
How does dt make a difference?

73
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,110
Does it matter?

74
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,220
For example, if we're looking at approximating

75
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,370
a log-normal price process by breaking it up

76
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,070
using a binomial random walk, by using

77
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,400
steps that are plus or minus 1 scaled appropriately

78
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,930
to the mean and volatility of the process

79
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,930
that we're interested in, how does that affect the answer?

80
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,810
So a useful thing to do is to start

81
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,790
with a known example, something that you

82
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,980
could do in closed form, where you could look up

83
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,410
the answer, where you could compute the integral.

84
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,870
And you can do the interval for this set of parameters

85
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,150
if you'd like and then compare with what

86
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,440
you get in Monte Carlo

87
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,780
Now, keep in mind when doing problem sets,

88
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,940
because the numbers are randomly generated,

89
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,142
your answer might not exactly match.

90
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:05,600
It's going to be within some range.

91
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,390
And in fact, as you rerun your Monte Carlo,

92
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,140
you'll see the answers change.

93
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,840
So what you might want to do is take

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,440
an average of your own answers.

95
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,260
In fact, what you might want to do

96
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,529
is not only run an ensemble of 10,000 paths,

97
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,700
compute the approximate analytics using the rules

98
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,820
that I mentioned before--

99
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,570
we approximate an expectation by taking an average

100
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,760
over the results--

101
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,240
but you could go further and run those 10,000 paths maybe

102
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,360
100 times and take the average of those,

103
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,820
or at least look at what their distribution is.

104
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,490
That tells you something about the confidence interval

105
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,130
within which your estimate lies.

106
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,680
Now, that's true in general for doing statistical analytics.

107
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,760
What about financial applications?

108
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,270
So one of the interesting things that we can do

109
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,610
is, when we've got these stock price paths,

110
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,000
is think about the behavior of financial derivatives.

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,780
Derivatives are securities like stock options

112
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,080
whose value depends on the value of another security.

113
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,210
And one of the important constructions

114
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,430
in applications and quantitative finance

115
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,440
and in derivative pricing is to compute expected values that

116
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,060
are functions of stock prices.

117
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,690
So the value of an option is a function

118
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,430
of the value of the stock underlying the option.

119
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,090
And in a Monte Carlo setting, we can compute plots

120
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,720
of functions of our variable.

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,170
So here's how we plot our paths initially.

122
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,980
And if we wanted to plot a function, say, s squared,

123
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,440
we can go into the code and change s to s squared

124
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,600
and take a look.

125
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,130
So if I had a derivative whose value

126
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,620
is equal to the square of the stock price,

127
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,320
these are simulations of what its value would be

128
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,880
Now, we're often interested in the terminal values,

129
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,900
especially for derivatives like options that expire.

130
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,600
So what we sometimes want to do is compute the terminal

131
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,670
or the final value of the stock price

132
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,140
and then the final value of a derivative.

133
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,740
So if we do that, I've plotted here

134
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,720
or I've computed S.terminal to be the final row of S.

135
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,650
And if I look at a histogram of S.terminal,

136
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,810
we can see what the distribution is.

137
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,080
If we want to take a look at the distribution

138
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,590
of our s squared values, because it follows the value all

139
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,260
the way along, we could just compute the histogram

140
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,930
of this quantity squared, but typically we'd

141
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,660
like to know of the entire lifetime of the option.

142
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, let's take a look at an interesting example

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,520
is to take a look at a call or a put option.

144
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,520
And in those cases, the derivative

145
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,260
has a value along the entire trajectory of the option,

146
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,580
but the valuation techniques that we often look at

147
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,070
involve separate considerations for the interior

148
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,600
prior to expiration and at expiration.

149
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,858
So if we consider a European-type option,

150
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:12,400
which has nothing to do with Europe--

151
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,260
it's just the name of the option--

152
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,170
it's something that can only be exercised at expiration,

153
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,367
at no time prior.

154
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,200
If it can be exercised early, it's typically

155
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,980
known as an American option.

156
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,340
So if we consider a European call option

157
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,700
on a stock with strike price K, and we'd

158
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,020
like to know what its distribution of terminal values

159
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,090
is, that would be an interesting question.

160
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,140
So for example, suppose we go back to our--

161
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,320
let's go back and look at our previous graph--

162
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,300
our original graph right here.

163
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,910
And suppose we have an option--

164
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,120
a stock option that gives us the right but not the obligation

165
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,500
to buy the stock if the price exceeds, say, $150.

166
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,670
So it starts at 100.

167
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,650
And we want to know a year later,

168
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,890
is it going to be in excess of $150 or not?

169
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,840
If yes, we will make money on our option.

170
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,570
If not, we would not exercise the option.

171
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,750
So one of the interesting questions we might ask

172
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,270
is, how likely is it that the value of the stock

173
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,430
will exceed a particular threshold?

174
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,660
And that's something we can answer with Monte Carlo.

175
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,040
Let's take a look at that.

176
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,380
So let's define a strike price K. Let's let it be 150.

177
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,250
And now let's define the value of our call option.

178
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,870
And we'll define it at all points

179
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,380
in time relative to the value of our stock price.

180
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,700
So let's say C is S minus K. Now, that's partly true.

181
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,150
That's good for all the points where S is greater than K

182
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,890
but not where it's less than K.

183
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,680
So what we'll do-- this is an r-specific construct.

184
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,300
You can do the same kind of thing

185
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,100
in different ways in other languages.

186
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,410
But I'm going to multiply this times

187
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,980
the expression S greater than K, which is a Boolean expression.

188
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,000
So it's equal to 1 if S is greater than K,

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,140
0 if S is equal to or less than K.

190
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,610
And it multiplies these point by point.

191
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,570
So this expression for C should give me

192
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,050
the value of the option when it's

193
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,810
in the money, when the stock price exceeds the strike price.

194
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,110
And it'll give me 0 otherwise.

195
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,340
So let's take a look at what some of those paths look like.

196
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,580
And I'm going to go back to my plotting function.

197
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,500
And I'm going to change S to C, and let's plot those.

198
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,110
Now, we notice the value never goes below zero, which is good.

199
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,130
So the options-- you cannot lose money apart from the premium

200
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,730
that you paid for the option.

201
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,930
So all the places where the paths hit 0 or don't even

202
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,480
show up, those are cases where the value was below the strike

203
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,310
price, and the other ones are above.

204
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,220
Now, we could ask-- this is just for the first 10 paths.

205
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,080
We could look at what happens over 100 paths.

206
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,100
But if we do that, we're still not getting the whole flavor.

207
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,890
Because we don't know what fraction of paths

208
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,230
are ending up above versus the number that we

209
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,100
don't see that are below.

210
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,450
So let's take a look.

211
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,040
We can look at the histogram of the terminal values, which is

212
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,170
going to be C of 252 comma 0--

213
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:27,440


214
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,810
excuse me-- 252 comma.

215
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,840
So we get all of the columns in our simulation.

216
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,740
And what we see is that of our 10,000 simulations,

217
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,410
6,000 of them ended up at 0.

218
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,920
So what we saw was the distribution

219
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,390
of the values above the strike price, but most of the values

220
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,780
are below the strike price.

221
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,560
So we have a very asymmetric distribution.

222
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,230
60% of the paths are worthless.

223
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,300
They finish below the strike price.

224
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,330
Of those that are above some of them go to quite large values.

225
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,680
In fact, that highest point that we can see in the pixel range--

226
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,760
600 is above the strike price of 150.

227
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,940
So that would be a very fortunate outcome.

228
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,380
Unfortunately, it's quite unlikely to happen.

229
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,210
So when we are working with derivatives,

230
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,320
we often create a sample of paths for the underlying.

231
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,490
We then compute functions of the underlying that

232
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,040
are appropriate to the value of the derivative,

233
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,070
and then we look at the analytics of interest.

234
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,720
One of the analytics of interest is

235
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,510
going to be the distribution of terminal values

236
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,160
and maybe some moments of its distribution,

237
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,010
such as the mean and the variance.

238
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,020
In this case, because the distribution

239
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,840
is so skewed and so unusual, we might

240
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,600
want to ask conditionally, for example,

241
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,190
conditioned on having a positive value, what is the mean?

242
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,340
And in other cases, such as options,

243
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,250
and it might have early exercise opportunities

244
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,260
where early exercise could be optimal

245
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,440
or where there may be barrier options whose value could

246
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,370
go to 0, say if it hits a particular value

247
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,160
during its lifetime prior to expiration, in those cases,

248
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,400
we want to work not just by averaging over

249
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,930
the entire ensemble of paths.

250
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,230
We might look path by path at which paths

251
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,380
meet certain conditions either at different points in time

252
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,700
in the case of early exercise or at different points in space

253
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:31,030
and in stock price in the case of barrier options.
