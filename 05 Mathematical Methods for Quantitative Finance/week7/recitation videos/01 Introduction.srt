PAUL F. MENDE: This week's material

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,340
covers applications of linear algebra to asset pricing.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,190
And they're really very close correspondences

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,340
between a lot basic notions of linear algebra

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,268
and those that are applied for the theory of asset pricing.

6
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:17,810
So I'd like to do something a little bit different this week.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,860
What I'd like to do, is do a review of linear algebra,

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,830
and along the way, we'll comment on the different terminology

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,710
and show how it maps to material that was

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,780
covered in the basic lectures.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,770
For people who need a refresher on linear algebra for this unit

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,290
and for upcoming things on optimization,

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,590
such as portfolio optimization, we have a lot of things

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,940
here from the basics.

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,340
But you won't learn all of linear algebra here;

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,020
this is really just to review.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,000
There are a couple of references we've put out.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,940
I recommend, a couple of books I recommend

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,520
and really anything you find online is probably great,

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,480
it's very standard subject, but it is

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,840
a prerequisite for the course.

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,360
However, if you want to brush up,

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,460
the book by Serge Lang, Introduction to Linear Algebra,

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,130
is very clear.

25
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,510
And the book by Sheldon Axler, Linear Algebra Done Right,

26
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,240
does set itself an ambitious goal.

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,410
You certainly don't need to read all of it,

28
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,370
but for the more mathematically minded,

29
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,770
you'll find it to be a very complete treatment.

30
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,740
But in particular, covers some things like dual spaces

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,130
that we discuss in the main lectures

32
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,790
that Lang doesn't cover.

33
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,950
So it's good on both those counts.

34
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,760
So we're going to cover this, but this subject

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,260
is a bit different.

36
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,690
And within the framework of this course,

37
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,430
it's going to be one unit.

38
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,470
Remember that this is a topics course.

39
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,640
These are methods that are used in different areas, not

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,410
necessarily as themselves.

41
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,410
But because you'll be seeing this in other courses,

42
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,520
in the Foundations of Finance, in Derivatives Pricing,

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,260
you'll see these ideas come up.

44
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,200
The idea of state prices, the idea of no arbitrage.

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,030
And often, they'll be in very specific contexts.

46
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,600
So what we've tried to do here, is give you

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,940
an algebraic foundation that is used

48
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,320
for more advanced treatments.

49
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,428
This is really just an introduction to that,

50
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,220
but it's so that you can think about what's

51
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,380
going on in a very general way.

52
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,170
At the same time, the problem sets

53
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,210
for this week are very simple.

54
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,400
They're not abstract at all.

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,770
They deal with numbers, small matrices you can do them

56
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,100
by hand, you can do them almost in your head,

57
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,730
you can put them on a computer.

58
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,060
So I don't think that we have a lot of detailed things,

59
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,710
like solving the diffusion equation

60
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,650
and Green's functions and binary value problems to worry about.

61
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,930
What I think we'll do instead, is take a look

62
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,400
at some of the basics.

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,380
And again, for the people who are

64
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,790
familiar with linear algebra, you'll

65
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,190
be able to make this identification along the way,

66
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,120
hopefully before I get there.

67
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,920
So let's get started.
