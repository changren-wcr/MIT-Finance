1
00:00:00,658 --> 00:00:02,200
PROFESSOR: Here's a warm-up exercise.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,610
For each of these sets of equations,

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,400
how many solutions are there?

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,690
I don't care what they are.

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,360
I just want you to find out how many there are.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,330
Now, this is a typical problem in linear algebra,

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:19,305
and it has a close connection to what we looked at in lectures

8
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:20,930
this week in asset pricing, where we're

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,970
looking at market structure.

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,150
And we ask, are markets complete?

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,460
How many different kinds of coverage

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,730
can we get to describe risks that

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,490
might happen in different possible states of the world,

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,530
to describe rewards and payoffs that

15
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,710
might happen in different states of the world?

16
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,480
We want to know, is it possible to cover everything?

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,110
And if it is possible to cover everything,

18
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,100
is our a solution unique?

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,338
If it's not possible to cover everything, what's missing?

20
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:51,380
What are the constraints?

21
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,460
What can we do?

22
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,140
If there are additional things that we

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,040
could do to complete a market, are those completions unique?

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,990
And we invert solutions.

25
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,430
We're given an answer.

26
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,250
We go back to the original problem.

27
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,550
These are all things that you've actually

28
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,860
seen in other guises for a long time,

29
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,108
solving equations as simple as this.

30
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:14,150
But what I'm going to do is go through the basics

31
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,550
of linear algebra as a review.

32
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,190
And I hope you've seen the lectures,

33
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,250
but if you're coming here first for linear algebra review,

34
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,800
you go back to the lectures, come back here again--

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,460
either way you do it, I hope you make

36
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,140
the connection between the two.

37
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,930
And certainly, feel free to skip parts, or speed it up

38
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,080
to 1 and 1/2 or twice speed if it helps it go by faster.

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,870


40
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,270
Vectors are elements in something called a vector

41
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,770
space.

42
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,980
And the key idea is not that they're columns of numbers.

43
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,080
The key idea is that they're objects

44
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,965
that can be added to get other objects of the same type.

45
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:52,340
And of course, we've been dealing

46
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,600
with that throughout the entire course,

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,420
not as columns of numbers, but we've

48
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,220
been looking at functions, where we add two functions,

49
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,190
for example, and we get another function.

50
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,850
If it obeys rules of addition and scalar multiplication,

51
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,699
and it's closed under those operations,

52
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,420
then we can think about this as a vector space.

53
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,520
There are properties of vector addition.

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,860
And this is not just for little arrows pointing in the plane.

55
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,140
This is true for any mathematical objects

56
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,360
that obey these properties.

57
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,110
We can call it a vector space.

58
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,480
It's commutative.

59
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,190
V plus w is the same thing as w plus v. It's associative.

60
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,180
You can do the addition in any order you'd like.

61
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:40,252
It has an identity, in this case, an additive identity

62
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,630
that we call 0.

63
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,990
And importantly, it has an additive inverse

64
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,020
that we can have a negative, and we can go the other way.

65
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,500
Now, one of the things that we saw in our example

66
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,710
during the lecture is that we can represent portfolio space

67
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,060
as being a set of vectors.

68
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,820
But do they form a vector space?

69
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,360
One of the requirements is that there be, for example, a 0.

70
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Is there?

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,920
Well, yeah.

72
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,450
You could have an empty portfolio.

73
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,120
You would add it to a portfolio, you would get nothing.

74
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,550
What about v plus w and w plus v?

75
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,210
Sure.

76
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,670
If you've got 100 shares of Coca-Cola stock

77
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,200
and 100 shares of Caterpillar, it

78
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,970
doesn't matter which way you add them.

79
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,130
They add up either way.

80
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,420
You can commute.

81
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,310
What about the additive inverse?

82
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,560
That's a bit tricky.

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,570
How do we have the opposite of a portfolio?

84
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,440
Well, the way we usually think about it is a simple answer.

85
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,320
And this is approximation to reality,

86
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,510
but definitely not the way real-world trading

87
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,920
exactly works.

88
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,800
We can think about short positions in a security

89
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,300
as being like owning a negative quantity of that security.

90
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,060
That says that if we have short positions,

91
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,570
we think that a short portfolio is identified

92
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,900
with a long portfolio because the long portfolio are

93
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,010
the stocks you would need to buy to cover a short position.

94
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,480
A short position, just as a reminder,

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,370
is when you borrow stock and you sell it,

96
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,680
but you have an obligation to replace the stock to the owner.

97
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,030
So there's a natural fit.

98
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,690
We can pick it out the additive inverse and the vector

99
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,470
as saying, what's the vector we need to add to get back to 0?

100
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,370
In the case of a financial portfolio of securities,

101
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,050
say that it is held short, we could

102
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,640
say, what's the portfolio that we would need to cover

103
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,840
a set of short positions?

104
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,210
That would be a minus of a minus v. That

105
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,880
would be v. We could say, what are the trades that we

106
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,420
need to do in order to liquidate a portfolio?

107
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,820
That might be a signed portfolio with negative signs

108
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,650
for responding to required sales.

109
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,260
And that would say that, if we have a portfolio,

110
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,393
the additive inverse is the portfolio

111
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:48,560
that you would need to sell.

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,830
You would need to take a negative relative position

113
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,300
in order to get to 0.

114
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,000
Those all have correspondences.

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,640
That's what we saw for portfolios in portfolio space

116
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,860
during the lecture this week.

117
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,350
Now, the scalars form a field--

118
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,050
and here, we use real numbers, not complex numbers.

119
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,200
And why is that important?

120
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,860
Well, first of all, there are properties that we have.

121
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,140
The a times b, we can associate it either way,

122
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,320
so we can multiply by a scalar--

123
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,870
with two scalars first or the vector first.

124
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,880
We have a distributive law for either multiplication

125
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,490
by scalars or multiplication--

126
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,020
so a scalar times a sum of vectors or a sum

127
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,530
of scalars times the vector.

128
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,230
Either way, we have these simple laws.

129
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,040
And there's a scalar identity, as well, which is the number 1.

130
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,070
So that's fine.

131
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,970
But where we run into an issue is that,

132
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,252
if we're thinking about portfolio space--

133
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:44,960
and there are lots of other vector spaces

134
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,130
that we use in finance.

135
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,710
But if we think specifically of a portfolio space,

136
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,550
and we think about our typical example of a set of stocks,

137
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,120
stocks can only be held in integer quantities.

138
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,340
And that doesn't form a field.

139
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,410
There are lots of these buzzwords that are here.

140
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,390
And we'll get to touch on some of them,

141
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,800
but certainly not all of them.

142
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,100
Let's look at some notions from linear algebra,

143
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,950
like linear dependence, basis, dimension,

144
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,080
different kinds of linear accommodation,

145
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,880
and have a direct application of what

146
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,890
we saw in the structure of financial markets.

147
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,080
A linear combination of vectors is

148
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,660
a sum of the vectors where we can multiply each vector

149
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,070
by an arbitrary scalar.

150
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,860
We saw an example of that in building a portfolio.

151
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,860
If you have a portfolio with 100 shares of stock a

152
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,220
and 200 shares of stock b, that's

153
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,470
the same as a single portfolio with components, say,

154
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,970
100 and 200.

155
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:47,450
Or it could be 100 times a portfolio with a single share

156
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,270
of stock plus 200 times the portfolio

157
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,220
with a single share of stock b.

158
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,470
So we can multiply things by constants.

159
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,700
We can add them together.

160
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,360
And that's a linear combination.

161
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,380
And that's an action that we can take on portfolios.

162
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,770
Very natural.

163
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,380
Now, a set of vectors is said to be linearly dependent if there

164
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,780
are a set of non-zero constants so that we

165
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,120
can write an equation like this where

166
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,890
we can set this equal to 0.

167
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,750
And of course, what that really means

168
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,780
is that we can solve for one of the vectors

169
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,600
in terms of the other vectors in the set.

170
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,570
That's what we mean by a redundant security.

171
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,410
We mean that its payoff could be reproduced by some combination

172
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,730
of other securities.

173
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,040
Simple example in the introduction I think I gave

174
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,180
was a trivial example, not even with column vectors

175
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,620
in a high-dimensional space.

176
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,210
If you have a $5 bill, a $10 bill, and a of $20 bills,

177
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,070
you can trade them off for one another.

178
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,430
You can replicate the payoff of one with the others.

179
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,140
However, we do need to be careful about the divisibility.

180
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,470
Assuming that we have constants, we

181
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,680
can show, though, that there are relationships.

182
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,210
For example, we could say that 4 $5 bills minus

183
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,880
& $20 bill is equal to 0.

184
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,530
And that would show that those are--

185
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,430
that's sufficient to show that those are linearly dependent.

186
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,130
And it's a pretty obvious notion.

187
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,480
This is the formal notion.

188
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,790
And then, if we can't do that, we

189
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,560
say that the vectors are linearly independent.

190
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,000
And this is really important.

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,440
It means that they describe different kinds of things.

192
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,840
An example in our portfolios would

193
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,630
be, in terms of our basic portfolio space,

194
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,750
if we have two different stocks--

195
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,000
they describe different things, that they describe

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,650
completely different payoffs--

197
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,870
they are independent of each other.

198
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,510


199
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,600
Linear dependence means that we can write one of the vectors

200
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,830
in terms of the others.

201
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,900
And in the case of our payoff matrix,

202
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,280
that means that we can write the payoff of one kind of security

203
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,580
in terms of another set of securities.

204
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,160
And that means that we could build a portfolio that

205
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,802
has exactly the same payoff.

206
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:01,260
And that means, in a certain sense,

207
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,510
you don't really need the first one.

208
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,290
Now, we might have it for lots of reasons, in the same way

209
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,110
that the existence of $1 bills doesn't mean that we

210
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,150
don't find $50 and $100 bills.

211
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,420
Of course we do.

212
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,880
They're there for lots of different reasons.

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
And the same thing is true in financial markets.

214
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,640
In fact, when it comes to derivative pricing,

215
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,890
there's an entire, enormous market of securities

216
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,200
that arguably are all redundant.

217
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,060
And yet there's an enormous demand for them,

218
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,980
and enormous trading activity, and they

219
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,570
perform very important functions in the economy.

220
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,580
When it comes just back to independence,

221
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,830
we have a very simple question, though, which is not,

222
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,150
how useful is it?

223
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,950
It's just, can you do this?

224
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,550
Can you write this equation?

225
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,220
And if you can, great.

226
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,620
Now, it says we really have one less degree of freedom.

227
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,830
In this example, it says v1 can be expressed

228
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,950
in terms of the others.

229
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,620
Now, there is a technical point here to make,

230
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,160
which is that we're dividing by a1,

231
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,830
and we do need to make sure that actually

232
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,150
leads to closure within our chosen field of scalars.

233
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,110
And if they're integers, the answer is actually no.

234
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,350
You can find a lot of things where this is not necessarily

235
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,690
going to work for different financial securities.

236
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,140
But it turns out that, in usual quantities that are done,

237
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,940
this tends to be pretty small.

238
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,740
And this is actually a good approximation,

239
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,880
but you do have to check.

240
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,860
Because either things are linearly independent

241
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,490
or they're not.

242
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,970
You can't be a little bit dependent.

243
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,760
From a mathematical point of view, there's a bright line.

244
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,260
From an applications point of view,

245
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,230
it requires judgment of the modeler.

246
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,550
And that's you.

247
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,240
That's why this is a course in mathematical methods

248
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,320
that are used.

249
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,630
We're going through the mathematical rules.

250
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,720
But how they get applied will depend.

251
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,660
Because in most real-world financial settings,

252
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,270
the assumptions the pure mathematics

253
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,280
are almost never satisfied, which means,

254
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,440
technically, we can't use any of the results.

255
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,180
And you'll need to use your judgment

256
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,238
to see when it might nevertheless be OK to do so.

257
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:05,780
There's an infinite number of factors

258
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,820
we can multiply by all of these constants,

259
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,280
but does that really mean that everything is infinite?

260
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,480
No, it doesn't.

261
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,400
If we start with a finite set of vectors,

262
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,130
we can use them to generate a vector

263
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,160
space just by taking all possible linear combinations

264
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,700
of them.

265
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,492
Then it's pretty clear that, even though we

266
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:24,860
could multiply times an infinite number of scalars

267
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,780
and get an infinite number of vectors,

268
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,660
everything is generated by a finite set.

269
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,060
We say that set spans the vector space.

270
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,030
And we call the vector-- we can say

271
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,630
that the vector space is the span of this set of vectors.

272
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,990
So it's true, by construction, that it's

273
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,170
closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

274
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,320
Now if, in addition to spanning the vector space,

275
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,970
the vectors are linearly independent,

276
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,910
then we say they form a basis for V. The basis isn't unique,

277
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,400
but it does mean it's the smallest number of vectors

278
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,257
that we have to have in order to describe everything

279
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,090
in the vector space.

280
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:12,100
And we call that number the dimension of the vector space.

281
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,910
Given a basis, we have a way to describe every vector

282
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,020
in the vector space.

283
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,080
It's a linear combination in terms of the basis vectors.

284
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,060
And this expression is unique.

285
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,940
And this leads us to our usual coordinate system.

286
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,700
Because we think of our column vectors

287
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,230
as being coordinates with respect to a basis.

288
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,035
If I have basis vectors u1, u2, u3,

289
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:35,080
and I take all possible linear combinations,

290
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,640
well I could write that-- so I have c1 times u1, c2 times u2,

291
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,920
and so on for any set of c's.

292
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,470
Our usual notation is we have these unit

293
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,300
vectors, these unit basis vectors,

294
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,110
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, and so on.

295
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,380
And we see that if we apply this rule,

296
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,120
we get our usual notation-- that we

297
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,370
get a column vector of numbers.

298
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,290
In the case of our classic payoff matrix,

299
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,480
we're looking at this in terms of columns,

300
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,120
we can think of the basis vectors as corresponding

301
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,190
to the arrow to our securities.

302
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,180
That is, they are the unit payoffs

303
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,100
in state 1 of the world, state 2 of the world,

304
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,120
state 3 of the world.

305
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,430
And we can take linear combinations.

306
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,940
If you want to end up with a vector that pays off 1, 2, 3,

307
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,000
it's 1 times the vector 1, 0, 0 plus twice

308
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,440
the vector 0, 1, 0, plus 3 times the vector 0, 0, 1.

309
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,611
So that gives us our usual notation.

310
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,900
Subspace of a vector space is a vector space

311
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,060
that's a subset of V. Now, that means

312
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,760
it has to be a vector space on its own.

313
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,550
And the span of a subset of basic factors of V

314
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,580
defines the subspace of V. If we take

315
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,080
a set of linearly independent vectors

316
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,300
that's smaller than the dimension of the space, then

317
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,925
we--

318
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:57,090
span is going to define a subspace.

319
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,830
We can always define something smaller.

320
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,050
You can think of a plane as a subspace

321
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,700
of three-dimensional space.

322
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,810
You can take a group of independent assets

323
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,440
less than everything and talk about what they span.

324
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,810
Because we're looking at everything generated

325
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,930
by a particular subset of basis vectors,

326
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,690
it has to be a vector space.

327
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,500
And we can take a look at the consequences.

328
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,000
