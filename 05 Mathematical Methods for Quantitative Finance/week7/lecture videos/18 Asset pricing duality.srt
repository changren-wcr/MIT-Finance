1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,310
PROFESSOR: Here's a concrete example.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,020
Suppose that we've got A is an incomplete--

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,630
represents the payoffs in an incomplete market.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,670
I have a stock and I have a bond.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,920
And the image of A is only two dimensional.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,530
So image of A is two dimensional because I have two securities.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,920
It's less than s, which is equal to 3.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,830
So the rank of the matrix A is equal to 2.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,790
And we know that.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,310
We know the largest it could be is the smaller

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,020
the number of its rows and columns.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,970
Because the two columns are independent,

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,770
it's exactly equal to 2.

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,080
So that image of A is a proper subspace of R3.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,670
It's only two dimensional.

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,150
A star is the transpose, which we've seen before.

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,890
We know it has a kernel, that is A star takes a three

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,500
dimensional space into a two dimensional space.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,520
Its kernel is the vector 1 minus 2, 1.

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,770
So suppose this-- this is a vector that lives in W star.

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,360
It lives in our dual space.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,170
So if I come back here, it lives in this space over here.

23
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:16,540
And now if I return, and I imagine that I take psi

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,670
equals this vector, which is an element

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,380
of the kernel of A star.

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,460
This isn't a valid state price vector,

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,620
but it does live in the space W star.

28
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,260
So this is just some vector.

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,640
We noticed it does have a negative element here.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,310
So this psi is an element of the kernel of A star.

31
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,360
And let's suppose it's going to act on the image of A.

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,560
So let's let b be the payoff of some portfolio.

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,260
So pick your favorite portfolio x,

34
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,030
act on it with the payoff matrix A, get its payoff b.

35
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,770
What is its state price?

36
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,890
Well, if we act with a state price that's

37
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,130
in the kernel of A star acting on b,

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,490
which is in the image of A, we can just do the computation.

39
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,590
Psi star acting on b is the same thing as star acting on A times

40
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,460
x.

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,949
We regroup, because it's associative.

42
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:14,820
That's the same thing as psi star A acting on x, which

43
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,660
is A star psi acting on x.

44
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,790
And that gives us 0.

45
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,870


46
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,210
Because psi was in the kernel of A star, A star acting on psi

47
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,190
is 0, therefore, this whole thing is 0.

48
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,260
And that tells us that the price of this portfolio--

49
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,459


50
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,160
or not the price, but if we act with psi star, which is not

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,870
a valid state price vector.

52
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,110
If we act with an element of the kernel of A star

53
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,570
with the image of A, we get 0.

54
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,510
So that helps us narrow things down.

55
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,300
So, let's bring it together.

56
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,830
We've got two different ways we can approach pricing.

57
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,050
And they're not just equivalent, they're called dual.

58
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,330
It's related to the dual prices, and they

59
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,680
have to give the same answers.

60
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,440
And you can use whichever one is more convenient.

61
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,090
State pricing says that we compute the price of our target

62
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,340
asset, the thing we might think about creating

63
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,210
a particular set of payoffs in different states of the world

64
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,910
by applying all of the allowed values of psi,

65
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,280
all of the valid state price vectors

66
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,830
which are consistent with our market structure.

67
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,440
The price is uniquely determined if b

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,870
is the payoff of a redundant asset,

69
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,020
is we know that redundant assets should have prices

70
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,670
that are uniquely determined.

71
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,360
In equations, we would say that the price of our asset

72
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,100
is given by--

73
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,690
see if I can get the pointer back--

74
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,420


75
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,560
there we go.

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,930
It's given by psi acting on b.

77
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,450
That is to say, the price we have

78
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,590
is psi star b where psi is consistent with the pricing

79
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,560
relationship, psi is in the dual space, and so all of its values

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,650
are positive.

81
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,030
So that's how we can do things in terms of state prices.

82
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,490
We can also do replication pricing, which

83
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,780
is what we started out with.

84
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,820
And we don't have any state prices involved at all.

85
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,860
You need to identify if it's a redundant asset, and if it is,

86
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,390
we associate the value of the payoff with the value

87
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,310
of the replicating portfolio.

88
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,150
That's required to avoid arbitrage.

89
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,750
Now, for non-redundant assets, we

90
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,320
can frame the allowed prices as a bound on the asset

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,110
prices that are subject to bounds

92
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,220
above and below by taking a look at possible replicating

93
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,390
portfolios.

94
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,620
In the dual side, we know what our view is about what

95
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,090
the allowed state prices are.

96
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,490
They have to be positive.

97
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,410
It's not quite as easy to find the price bounds

98
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,380
in our replicating pricing world,

99
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,040
but we do it by looking at the outside values where

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,060
we can replicate the portfolio.

101
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,270
We can find a minimum bound on the price

102
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,080
by defining S min to be the largest price that we can

103
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,770
observe for any portfolio that is strictly

104
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,310
less for each of its components than the target payoff b.

105
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,340
If that's the case, we know that this portfolio

106
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,490
has to be strictly less than--

107
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,710
or that the price of this portfolio

108
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,490
has to be strictly greater than the price of this portfolio.

109
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,830
And, similarly, we can look for a bound on the other side.

110
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,910
So if we think back to our first example of stochastic dominance

111
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,770
comparing a stock and bond, we think

112
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,810
about having a degree of freedom that lets

113
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,800
is very the portfolios so that we can move around and arrange

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,010
to where we can see the crossover points between where

115
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,730
we would exceed a payoff, or go below our lower payoff in one

116
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,870
of our components.

117
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,090
We can, with quite a bit more work,

118
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,400
we can identify bounds for the prices.

119
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,440
But either way in either picture,

120
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,750
when we have non-redundant assets,

121
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,070
their prices are not uniquely determined.

122
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,640
But there are constraints to arbitrage.

123
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,100
There are certain values that they're allowed to have

124
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,570
and some values that they can't have.
