1
00:00:01,457 --> 00:00:03,040
PROFESSOR: Let's talk about arbitrage.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,360
And I'm going to talk about two kinds of arbitrage.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,180
And we'll call them type I and type II.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,990
What's type I arbitrage?

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,280
So type I arbitrage says you pay nothing now,

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,730
and you get something later.

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,650
So type I arbitrage is something for nothing.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,030
The idea is that, right now, the value of a portfolio

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,250
is either 0 or it's negative.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,762
Negative value means that, when you buy it,

11
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,220
you get a negative amount of money.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,730
That means you get paid to own this portfolio.

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,890
So suppose I have a portfolio.

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,920
So I have a marketplace where the prices are given.

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,270
They're given by us.

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,220
I pick a portfolio x.

17
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,540
And suppose that there exists a portfolio such that S acting

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,810
on x gives a value that's negative, that's less than

19
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,640
or equal to 0.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,650
Let's say it's negative, or it's equal to 0.

21
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,100
And suppose, later on, that there's

22
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,750
a non-negative-- there are only non-negative payoffs,

23
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,610
and at least one payoff is 0.

24
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,890
So if it's purely equal-- if it's the zero vector,

25
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,060
that would be trivial.

26
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,670
But, otherwise, what we want to have is, in the future,

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,430
some states could have a zero payoff,

28
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,790
but there's at least one state in the future that's positive.

29
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,770
And none of the future states are negative.

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,130
So, in this case, this would be terrific.

31
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,770
This is no risk.

32
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,970
I either pay nothing, or I get paid.

33
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,190
And there's no way I can lose in the future.

34
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,900
So basic common sense and finance theory

35
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,490
say that this kind of thing shouldn't

36
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,020
exist in the marketplace.

37
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,060
If it did, people would exploit it,

38
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,050
and it would disappear very quickly.

39
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,520
Therefore, it's going to serve on a constraint about the kinds

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,310
of market structures and pricing relationships

41
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,030
that we might observe.

42
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,480
So the notation here, I do want to point out

43
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,760
one thing, which is not standard in linear algebra.

44
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,230
Most of what we do will be.

45
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,810
But, normally, we don't write vector inequalities like this.

46
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,540
So, in this case, here's precisely what I mean.

47
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,580
What I mean is that this holds for all the components, OK?

48
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,100
So each of the components has this inequality.

49
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,940
Some of the components can be 0.

50
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,620
None of them can be negative.

51
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,660
But I'm also going, when I write this,

52
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,180
to require that at least one component is positive.

53
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,900
And, since there's no other notation for it,

54
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,820
I'm going to steal this one and torture it slightly

55
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,990
for our purposes.

56
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,150
But common sense and our ideas about arbitrage

57
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,590
should tell you what we mean.

58
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,450
And the case where everything is 0

59
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,290
is certainly going to be a trivial case.

60
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,040
So this is type I arbitrage, something

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,310
for nothing with no risk.

62
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,140
Let's try an example.

63
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,849
Suppose I have a securities market

64
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,710
with two securities, a stock and a bond,

65
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,450
and there are three states of the world.

66
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,920
And the prices are given by the vector S equals 1, 1.

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,900
And I look at the portfolio that's

68
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,310
short a bond and long a stock.

69
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,030
Then S acting on x, the market value of the portfolio,

70
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,099
is 0 because they have equal prices,

71
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,939
and I'm long one and short the other.

72
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,219
And the payoff matrix acting on x is 2, 1, 0.

73
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:04,219
And that's what we said would constitute an arbitrage.

74
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,260
The value of the portfolio is 0 or negative.

75
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,479
In this case, it's 0.

76
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,510
And the payoffs are non-negative, and at least one

77
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,260
of them is positive.

78
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,599
Now, what if we were to change the prices?

79
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,930
This is for this particular set of prices.

80
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,560
Can we say something about prices

81
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,750
that would prevent arbitrage from occurring?

82
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,210
So consider this.

83
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,310
Can arbitrage be avoided in this example?

84
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,000
Three choices-- yes if S2 is greater than 1,

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,070
yes if S1 is less than 0--

86
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:42,570
less than 1, or no, arbitrage can't be avoided at all.
