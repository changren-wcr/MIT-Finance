00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,848


1
00:00:00,848 --> 00:00:02,390
PROFESSOR: So the answer in this case

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:08,010
is yes, provided that S2 is bigger than S1.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,100
In that case, we'll have a positive price

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,220
for this portfolio.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,590
And there's no contradiction.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,980
The problem here was that the stock stochastically

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,170
dominates the bond we say in technical terms.

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,600
Or, in common sense, the stock is always

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,580
better than or equal to the bond in each state of the world.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,540
No matter what the possible outcome is,

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,195
the stock is as good or better.

12
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:33,910
It has a payoff equal to or greater than that of the bond.

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,060
So its price must be higher.

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,590
That's a very easy case to consider.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,270


16
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,680
Type II arbitrage, in contrast to type I arbitrage,

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,573
is a case where there are redundant assets.

18
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:49,240
And, in this case, that means that there

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,440
are non-trivial solutions to the payoff matrix equation,

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,150
Ax equals 0.

21
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,690
That means that A is less than the rank S.

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,650
And it means that there's a non-trivial kernel

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,190
to the matrix A.

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,570
So type II arbitrage says that, if there's

25
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,560
a portfolio with zero payoff, then it has a non-zero price.

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,010
So our previous example, in type I,

27
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,330
we could get something for nothing.

28
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,450
And, in this case, you get nothing for something.

29
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,240
So all that's required for type II arbitrage

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,960
is that a portfolio that has zero payoff

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,292
has a non-zero price.

32
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:31,750
And we don't even care whether it's

33
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,730
a positive or a negative price because we

34
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,160
could go long or short, whichever sign we

35
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,120
need to make money for free.

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,900
That is we're going to collect money

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,550
by selling a portfolio that has no payoffs at all.

38
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,410
And we can get money in the present.

39
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,750
Again, that's the kind of thing that shouldn't really

40
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,280
be allowed in a well functioning,

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,390
properly set up security market.

42
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,520
So let's take a look at an example.

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,700
In this case, let's go back to our original payoff

44
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,780
matrix example A. And let's consider this portfolio--

45
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,500
1, 2, 1, 5-- so one bond, two shares

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,620
of stock, and six call options of the different strikes.

47
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,040
And consider-- so that's my pricing vector.

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,470
And then consider this particular portfolio.

49
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,960
Well, A acting on this portfolio,

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,820
because the last security is a redundant security,

51
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,860
this has zero payoff, but it has a non-zero price.

52
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,110
That means it permits arbitrage.

53
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,930
What we expect to have to avoid arbitrage

54
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,040
is that, if the payoff is zero, the price must be zero.

55
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,600
Violating that is type II arbitrage.

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,690
So can we change the prices so that we could avoid arbitrage

57
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,780
in this market?
