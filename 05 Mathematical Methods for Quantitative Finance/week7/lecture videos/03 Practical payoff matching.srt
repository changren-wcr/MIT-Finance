1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,570
PROFESSOR: So the payoff matrix is

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,960
how we think about what it's possible to create.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,890
And when we think about looking at derivatives markets, when

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,400
we think about many problems, business problems, managing

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,180
risks, looking for insurance, covering and hedging

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,420
risky positions, we're often looking for ways

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,750
to construct a portfolio of financial instruments

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,920
or contracts that will balance certain risks that we have

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,140
that are either part of an investment portfolio

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,850
that consists of securities, or possibly other business

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,560
and financial and corporate risks that

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,240
occur in different states of the world.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,540
So this is the problem of risk management.

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,330
We want to ask, can we find portfolios

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,840
of financial instruments that meet desired payoff

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,055
profiles that might either satisfy an urge for gambling

17
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,430
in different states of the world,

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,790
but more commonly in the financial industry context.

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,790
We're looking for combinations of assets

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,640
that can match certain exposures or risks that

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,500
might occur in different states of the world.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,000
