1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,550
PROFESSOR: Let's talk about the structure of financial markets

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,380
and when markets are complete, incomplete, or overcomplete.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,133
We've seen a variety of instruments

4
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:10,050
in different settings.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,860
We've seen stocks, we've seen bonds,

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,610
we've seen derivatives such as options.

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,680
Let's take a look at the kinds of instruments

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,040
can exist within a marketplace, what kinds of relationships

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,880
there might be among them, and what kinds of openings

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,630
there are for financial innovation.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,130
So the tools to do that are going

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,900
to be basic linear algebra.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,050
And we're going to take a starting example

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,355
to get us warmed up to the subject is a simple model

15
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,300
for a one-period market.

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,058
So there's going to be an initial time,

17
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:44,100
we'll call it to equal 0.

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,320
And there's one step ahead in the future.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,607
We're going to look at a small number of securities,

20
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:50,190
and we're going to see what we can say

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,880
and how we can characterize the relationships among them.

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,640
This model, which we're only going to introduce,

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,250
can be developed into a multi-period model, which

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,830
can lead to things like the binomial tree model,

25
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,500
and bring us full circle back to things

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,390
like the models of continuous time

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,100
finance that we've been studying earlier.

28
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,790
However, with an appreciation about the kinds

29
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,160
of relationships that might be available

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,815
and that might be required among the different instruments

31
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:19,060
in the marketplace.

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,370
So here's our simple model.

33
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,230
Let's take a look.

34
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,140
So our first model is going to be

35
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,190
a one-period model where there are two times, time 0 and time

36
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,000
1.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,092
And we're going to have four securities in this market.

38
00:01:35,092 --> 00:01:37,300
So let's take a look at what they are, and then we'll

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,120
see how we can model this using simple concepts

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,020
from linear algebra.

41
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,650
So the securities that we have are

42
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,470
going to be a bond, a stock, and two call options,

43
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,860
call option with strike 1.5 dollars,

44
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,800
and a call option with strike price of $1.

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,150
There are going to be three states of the world.

46
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,180
We're going to imagine the states of the world

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,760
as being three possible outcomes.

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,750
They might be a good economy, a bad economy, and a pandemic,

49
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,410
or some terrible economy.

50
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,960
So let's just give the names 1, 2, and 3.

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,030
This could be any number.

52
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,200
We're keeping it small to make it so the algebra

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
you can almost do in your head, and the slides

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,840
can fit on one page.

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,460
This could be any number of discrete states.

56
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,860
We're assuming that they are mutually exclusive

57
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,940
and that they cover all the possibilities.

58
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,870
So the probability up in each state adds up to 1.

59
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,830
So we'll assign a probability 1/2, 1/6, and 1/3.

60
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,290
One of the fascinating things that we're about to see

61
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,710
is that these probabilities, the real world probabilities

62
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,600
of appearing in these different states,

63
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,020
don't matter at all for the pricing relationships

64
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,490
that we're going to explore.

65
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,070
So what about each of the options?

66
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,500
Well, we would like to know how much it's worth in the future.

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,640
We're going to assume that the price now is fixed.

68
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,223
We're not going to say yet what it is.

69
00:02:57,223 --> 00:02:58,370
We'll get to that in a bit.

70
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,300
But we're going to ask what the future value is going to be,

71
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,470
and this is known as the payoff.

72
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,400
So the payoff for a risk-free bond

73
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,220
is going to be defined as $1 in the future.

74
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,040
What makes it risk-free is not that it's $1,

75
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,320
it's that the outcome doesn't depend on what state

76
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,670
of the world we're in.

77
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,850
The stock, on the other hand, is going to be a risky asset.

78
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,130
The amount that it's worth depends on which state

79
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,850
we're in.

80
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,960
It could be worth $3.

81
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,980
It could be worth $2.

82
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,540
It could be worth $1.

83
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,040
It might even be worth less than the value of the bond.

84
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,230
The call option, however, is determined

85
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,110
based on the value of the stock because it's

86
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,280
a call option on that stock.

87
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,180
So, if the strike price is 1 and a half dollars

88
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,140
and the stock price finishes in one period at $3,

89
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,910
then it's worth 1 and a half dollars

90
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,310
because we could exercise it immediately

91
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,880
to buy stock for 1 and a half dollars, sell it for 3,

92
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,460
and capture a value of 1 and a half.

93
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,880
Similarly, if the stock price is $2,

94
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,640
we could buy at 1 and a a half, sell at $2,

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,860
make it a profit of $0.50.

96
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,110
But the value is 0 in the lowest state of the world

97
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,140
because we're not going to buy a stock for $1.50 if the market

98
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,820
price is $1.

99
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,220
Our second option, the call option

100
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,250
with a strike price of $1, is worth $2

101
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,399
in this state of the world, $1 in this state of the world,

102
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,970
and 0, again, if the market price exceeds

103
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,940
the value of the call option.

104
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,290
You can extend this with puts, with other options

105
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,960
of other strikes, and so on.

106
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,643
So, what did we leave out?

107
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:32,060
Well, this is very-- first of all,

108
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,880
we only have three states of the world.

109
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,750
We've left out a lot of possibilities

110
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,480
that these values might have.

111
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,840
We're assuming that we can buy or sell these freely,

112
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,850
and that we can hold any quantity that we'd

113
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,930
like to have.

114
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,660
But we're going to start with this idealized market

115
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,240
where there are no market frictions.

116
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,740
And we're going to see what these relationships

117
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,330
among the future payoffs imply about these instruments.

118
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,430
So let's group these numbers together the payoffs

119
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,590
that are received for each security

120
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,050
in each state of the world, an object we're going

121
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,700
to call the payoff matrix.

122
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,600
So let there be n different securities

123
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,680
and s states of the world.

124
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,660
In our example n is equal to 4, s is equal to 3.

125
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,640
And we're going to represent the payoffs

126
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,000
for each security at our fixed time in the future

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,785
as being a column vector of length s.

128
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:26,410
And we're going to collect them in the form of a payoff matrix.

129
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,340
So the payoff matrix is a mapping from Rn to Rs.

130
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,230
So Rn, where we've got four different securities,

131
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,730
tells us which securities we have.

132
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,940
And for each security, we're going

133
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,790
to see what it's payoffs are.

134
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,260
And there are three possibilities

135
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,180
for the payoffs, Rs.

136
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,813
So in our example where n is 4 and s

137
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:50,230
is 3 and the numbers of the ones I

138
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,850
showed you on the previous table,

139
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,620
this would be the payoff matrix.

140
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,850
The first column represents the payoff of the risk-free bond.

141
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,110
In states 1, 2, and 3, it receives $1.

142
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,110
So how would we represent that as a vector

143
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,100
in our initial space Rn?

144
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,130
Well, we could represent that by a vector, say, that is x--

145
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,440
I may not be consistent in keeping arrows

146
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,970
over all of my vectors--

147
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,880
is 1, 0, 0, 0 because I have one bond in the first position.

148
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,250
And that corresponds to my first column.

149
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:33,130
If I take the matrix A acting on the vector x, I get--

150
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,810
because this is a unit vector--

151
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,880
I get the first column, so I would get 1, 1, 1.

152
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,040
If I change my vector, for example,

153
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,220
I look at a vector corresponding to a single share of stock,

154
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:52,980
let's call this x2, that would be represented by 0, 1, 0, 0.

155
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:02,310
And A acting on x2 gives 3, 2, 1.

156
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,660
What if I have a mixed portfolio with stocks and bonds?

157
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,240
Well, suppose I have a vector.

158
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,540
Let's call it x.

159
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:22,630
And say that it's equal to qB, qs, 0, 0,

160
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,230
where qB is the number of bonds I have and qs

161
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,300
is the number of stocks that I have,

162
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:36,610
then the payoff Ax is obviously going to be qB times 1,

163
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:43,810
1, 1, plus qs times 3, 2, 1.

164
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,410
That is to say, portfolios form a vector space.

165
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:57,840
So I can write x as being qB times the first basis vector

166
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,340
plus--

167
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,620


168
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,270
plus I have a jumpy pen--

169
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,950


170
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,770
qs times 0, 1, 0, 0.

171
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,480
And remember that this is a linear algebra.

172
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,900
So a matrix multiplication applies

173
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,590
to the rules of linearity.

174
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,330
So I can say that A times x in this case

175
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:36,039
is going to be A acting on qB, qs, 0, 0,

176
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:47,910
which is A acting on qB times 1, 0, 0, 0 plus qs times 0, 1, 0,

177
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,090
0.

178
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,610
And, by our usual rules of linearity,

179
00:08:52,610 --> 00:09:03,310
this is going to be qB times A of 1, 0, 0, 0 plus qs

180
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,850
of A acting on 0, 1, 0, 0.

181
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,280
And then we get the result that I wrote down before.

182
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,550
Remember that A acting on the first basis vector

183
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,930
gives us the first column of the matrix.

184
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,320
A acting on the second basis vector

185
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,150
gives us the second column and so on.

186
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,680
So we're finally left with our value

187
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,970
is going to be qB plus 3 qs in the first state of the world,

188
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,790
qB plus 2 qs in the second state of the world,

189
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,560
and qB plus qs in the third state

190
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:49,290
of the world for our portfolio with qB bonds and qs stocks.
