1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,220
PROFESSOR: Now, I mentioned before

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,430
that we might have securities that aren't independent.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,590
We might have more securities than there

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,940
are states of the world.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,790
And we might have securities that actually are not

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,120
really needed, that are equivalent to other securities.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,770
And, at first glance, we might think

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,360
that that would be superfluous.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,460
But we do it all the time.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,850
Just because we have $1 bills in the American economy,

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,750
$5 bills are superfluous.

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,720
You can make a 5 out of five 1's.

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,970
And you can make a 20 out of four 5's.

14
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,890
But we do have these different instruments

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,210
because they're convenient.

16
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,110
Now, there are no arbitrage relationships among them.

17
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,190
You would be hard pressed to find someone who's

18
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,960
going to trade you at a different rate

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,170
$5 bills for $10 bills than the expected

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,330
ratio between their face values.

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,890
But, when we're talking about instruments that are risky,

22
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,740
unlike risk-free instruments like dollar bills,

23
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,190
the answer isn't always so obvious.

24
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,660
And markets do have a lot of room for extra instruments.

25
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,010
And we'll see that these are really valuable.

26
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,670
So we have a notion from our study

27
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,710
of options that options in a certain sense

28
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,920
are different instruments than stocks

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,820
because they have different payoffs.

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,800
On the other hand, because they can be dynamically hedged

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,210
using stocks, there's a sense in which the payoff in an option

32
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,030
can be replicated, albeit dynamically,

33
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,130
by a portfolio of stock.

34
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,510
So how do we look at this?

35
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,330
Well, let's take a look at our world, which

36
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,810
is not very dynamic.

37
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,220
It's only got one period.

38
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,470
So the structure is going to be a lot simpler.

39
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,440
So in complete and incomplete markets,

40
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,600
we could have redundant securities.

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,530
And that occurs when securities or sets of securities

42
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,650
have payoffs that are linearly dependent.

43
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,470
We often say that that means that one or more

44
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,450
securities have payoffs that can be

45
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,420
replicated by a portfolio of other securities.

46
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,600
And really, if one portfolio can replicate another,

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,080
we usually can turn it around in either direction.

48
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,780
Mathematically, that's equivalent of saying

49
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,810
that the kernel or the null space of A is non-empty,

50
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,410
or the dimension of the kernel of A is bigger than 0

51
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,340
if you want.

52
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,830
That means that there are portfolios

53
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,280
that have zero payoff because, if we take

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,280
that portfolio, a portfolio of zero payoffs,

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,760
we add it to some portfolio that has a payoff that we want.

56
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,510
The resulting portfolio is a different portfolio

57
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,120
with the same payoff.

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,840
That's what we mean by redundant.

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,540
Redundant means there are multiple portfolios that

60
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,920
have the same payoff.

61
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,570
Now, in this case, we know that the kernel of a linear operator

62
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,010
is itself a vector space.

63
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,630
So, obviously, if I add some element of the kernel,

64
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,920
I could add some multiple of the kernel as well.

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,880
If we want to look at this on the blackboard,

66
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,390
suppose that we have a portfolio that

67
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,300
is equal to a given target.

68
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,370
So x is our portfolio.

69
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,720
b is our payoff.

70
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,490
A is the payoff matrix.

71
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:20,770
And suppose that z is an element of the kernel of A.

72
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,990
Mathematically, that just means--

73
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,490
all I'm saying is that A acting on z is equal to 0.

74
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,710
And it means I'm always leaving out the trivial case where

75
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,310
z is a non-zero vector.

76
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,280
So, if A acting on z is equal to 0,

77
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,170
what happens to the portfolio?

78
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,460
Suppose I consider the portfolio--

79
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,910
let's call at x prime--

80
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,630
to be x plus an arbitrary constant times z.

81
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,910
Well, the payoff on x prime is A acting

82
00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:00,120
on x prime, which is A acting on x

83
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,140
plus cz, which, by linearity, is A acting on x

84
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,970
plus c times A acting on z.

85
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,760
The first term is equal to b.

86
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,000
And the second term is equal to 0 because A acting on 0

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,649
is equal to 0.

88
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,090
So we see that, if I have a non-zero z,

89
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,390
I have a one-parameter family of solutions,

90
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,710
of redundant securities of portfolios, all of which

91
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,700
have the same payoff.

92
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,720
So, if redundant securities exist,

93
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,780
then we don't have a unique association between portfolios.

94
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,880
The payoff is not one to one.

95
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,420
But, for a given portfolio, for a given x, we know what b is.

96
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,560
We act with A on x.

97
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,720
We get a definite answer by doing matrix multiplication.

98
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,530
But, for a given payoff b, there might

99
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,570
be more than one portfolio that solves the equation.

100
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,720
So, just as I showed you on the blackboard,

101
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,340
we can take any solution.

102
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,730
We can add to it a multiple of any arbitrage portfolio.

103
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,810
And it's going to have the same payoff.

104
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,250
Now, in an incomplete market, the existence of solutions

105
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,940
depends on b.

106
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,080
So there might be no solutions at all.

107
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,550
But, if there is a portfolio that has a solution,

108
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,050
then there's going to be an infinite number of solutions.
