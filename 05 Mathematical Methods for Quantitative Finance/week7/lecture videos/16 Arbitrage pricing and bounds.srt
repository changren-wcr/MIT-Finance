1
00:00:00,997 --> 00:00:02,830
PROFESSOR: So let's combine what we've seen.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,630
Suppose we're given a payoff matrix

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,160
A. We're given market prices S. And we're given a target payoff

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,390
b.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,390
What do we do?

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,620
Well, we want to find all state price factors that

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,730
satisfy our pricing equation.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,990
Are there any solutions?

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,440
Is there a unique solution?

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,050
Or are there multiple solutions?

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,940
If there are no solutions to this equation,

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,780
then this market structure permits arbitrage.

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,650
If there's a unique solution, then it's a complete market.

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,840
And, if there are multiple solutions,

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,930
that means that it's an incomplete market.

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,170
What we do is we then price the asset

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,940
using all of the solutions.

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,330
That is the target payoff b.

19
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,240
We act on it with psi star.

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,260
If there's one solution for psi, then it's easy,

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,230
and we have a redundant asset.

22
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,370
Psi is greater than 0, and we compute

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,060
the price of the redundant asset as psi star b.

24
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,810
Otherwise, we find that there's a full range of allowed prices

25
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,990
that are all consistent with no arbitrage, provided that they

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,420
correspond to state price vectors that

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,235
have only positive values.

28
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:14,000


29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,360
For example, consider our incomplete market.

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,930
So, if we have A is given by a stock and a bond,

31
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,300
the prices are given by 1, 2, and we're

32
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,300
asked for a specific target payoff,

33
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,330
say, 1 and 1/2, 1/2, 0, which is,

34
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,330
after all, the payoff of one of our original securities

35
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,510
from our first slide in this week's material,

36
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,350
then what can we say?

37
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,960
Well, we know that psi is given by 0, 1, 0

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,270
plus some multiple of the kernel.

39
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,140
And, to be consistent, A star psi equal to S,

40
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,830
we know that we need to have x is between 0 and 1/2.

41
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,430
So what's the price that we can associate with this call

42
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,270
option?

43
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,420
Well, to price the call option, we compute

44
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,500
psi star b for all allowed values of x.

45
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,139
That tells us that we get, by acting with psi star b

46
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,970
and applying linearity, it's equal to 1/2 plus x times 1/2.

47
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,820
And that means that we get 1/2 of 1 plus x.

48
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,760
Substituting in for the allowed values of x,

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,060
we find that the allowed values of this call

50
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,380
option in this incomplete market that is only a stock and a bond

51
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,710
are between 1/2 and 3/4.

52
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,420
So this is a new asset.

53
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,260
It's not a redundant asset.

54
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,200
There's no way to make it out of the existing securities.

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,900
Nevertheless, arbitrage pricing set

56
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,860
to bound based on the existing prices in the market

57
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,590
that it can't violate under penalty of arbitrage.
