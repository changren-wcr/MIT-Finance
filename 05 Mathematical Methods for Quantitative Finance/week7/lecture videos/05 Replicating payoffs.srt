00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,210


1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,500
PROFESSOR: Let's take a look at an example.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,760
So suppose I have this reduced payoff matrix.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,290
Suppose I have a world with three securities, and I have--

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,060
so I have three securities represented

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,267
by the first columns.

6
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:15,850
Think of them as being our first three

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,810
securities, a bond in column 1, a stock in column 2,

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,410
and a call option on stock with strike price 1 and 1/2

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,958
in column 3, but no fourth security.

10
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,500
And I have three states of the world.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,340
So now my payoff matrix is 3 by 3.

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,650
And suppose the payoff I'm interested in

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,810
is 2, 1, 0, which, incidentally, was the column that we

14
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,430
lopped off from our matrix.

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,410
But suppose we asked a question.

16
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,020
Can the K equals 1 call option, column b, the vector 2, 1,

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,110
0, be replicated from the other three securities?

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,360
So why don't you take a moment to think about that?

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,450
See if you can come up with a three vector

20
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,100
x such that A acting on x is equal to b.

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,429
Or can you show that there's no such thing that exists?

22
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:08,670


23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,920
Well, A is invertible.

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,420
So let's invert it.

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,960
If we invert A, we can find it has this form.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,190
I did this numerically.

27
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,648
Generally, you're not going to want

28
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:21,840
to invert any matrix larger than 2 by 2 in your head.

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,790
You should know how to do a 2 by 2 matrix in your head.

30
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,790
But, in this case, here's A inverse.

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,860
So, because A is invertible, we have a unique solution for x.

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,080
So not only is there a solution for x.

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,290
It's unique, and the solution is the portfolio

34
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,320
minus 1, 1, which is equivalent to being

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,870
long one share of stock and short one bond.

36
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,950
And you can see that.

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,170
Look at the second column here.

38
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,000
Subtract the first column.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,440
And we get 2, 1, 0.

40
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,560
So I take 3 minus 1 and 2 minus 1 and 1 minus 1.

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,190
And that gives me this column.

42
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,760
So you can see it by inspection, and the third column

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,830
doesn't matter at all.

44
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,660


45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:09,240
Therefore, the fourth security in our original payoff matrix

46
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,570
is redundant.

47
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,360
So, in our original payoff matrix

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,450
where we had four securities and three states of the world,

49
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,900
because the fourth column, 2, 1, 0, can

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,360
be written as a linear combination,

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,540
because its payoff is equivalent to be long the stock and short

52
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,420
the bond, it's a redundant security.

53
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,160
We have an overcomplete market.

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,480
Its payoffs is identical to a portfolio of basis assets.

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,240
And that tells us that we have more securities than we need,

56
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,220
and one of them is redundant.

57
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,400
How about this example?

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,280
Let's reduce things even further.

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,710
Suppose I remove the call option.

60
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,840
Can the K equals 1 call be replicated

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,500
from two other securities?

62
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,110
Well, this is a little bit different.

63
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,130
We know that it can, but we also know that the matrix is not

64
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,660
invertible in this case.

65
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,650
In fact, the matrix is a 3 by 2 matrix.

66
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,380
So it's not invertible because it isn't even square.

67
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,195
There's no chance of inverting it.

68
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:09,590
But a solution still exists.

69
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,850
So this is what we said that, when we have a 3 by 2 matrix,

70
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:18,610
we're taking two vectors into a three-dimensional space.

71
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,100
There's no way that we can hit all possible three

72
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,170
vectors and all possible payoffs,

73
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,820
but we can hit some of them.

74
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
And this is one of those lucky payoffs that we can hit.

75
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,520
So, in this case, if we pick x to be the same portfolio, short

76
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,580
a bond, long a stock, even though we have only two

77
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,640
securities, we still can get this payoff,

78
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,680
but there are some payoffs that we can't get.

79
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,670


80
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,390
Another example, suppose we include in our security world

81
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,890
the K equals 1 call.

82
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,580
And now let's kick out the K equals 1 and 1/2 call and ask

83
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,150
if it can be replicated from the other three securities.

84
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,470
What do you think?

85
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,270
Can you find a linear combination

86
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,660
of these three securities that gives b as a payoff?

87
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,980


88
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,160
Well, the rank of the matrix is 2.

89
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,180
We know it's singular because we know

90
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,500
the third column is a linear combination of the first two.

91
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,130
We've already seen that.

92
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,240
So A is not invertible.

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,300
And, actually, this option can't be replicated.

94
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,090
And this market then would be incomplete

95
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:34,390
because there are payoffs, such as 1.5, 0.5, and 0, that do not

96
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,200
have portfolios to create them.

97
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,500
And that's true whether I include the stock and the bond,

98
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,080
which are independent securities,

99
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,090
or whether I add a redundant security.

100
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,190
Obviously, adding the third column

101
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,680
doesn't help me any because the third column just

102
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,440
has the same information and the same possibilities

103
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,410
as the first two since I'm already free to make portfolios

104
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,350
from them.

105
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,030
So, in this case, we've got an incomplete market where

106
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,150
here's an example of a payoff that cannot be replicated

107
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,890
by the other three securities.

108
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,710
One of those three securities is linearly

109
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,150
dependent on the others.

110
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,995
That means that the rank is not full rank,

111
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:10,570
and it's not invertible.

112
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,050
If they were independent, if the matrix were invertible,

113
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,425
then we'd have a unique solution.

114
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:17,720


115
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,690
A complete market is one in which

116
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,500
we can get any payout from a portfolio of our basis assets.

117
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,650
So, in a complete market, the payoff matrix

118
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,500
has rank equal to the number of states.

119
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,660
In our example of a three-dimensional state

120
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,170
space means that the matrix needs to have rank 3.

121
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,670
If, in addition, we have three securities, or we have n

122
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:46,220
equals s, then we don't have extra redundant securities.

123
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,340
It means that we have a matrix of full rank.

124
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,670
So, if n is equal to s--

125
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,110
so it's a square matrix--

126
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,410
and the rank is equal to the number of rows and columns,

127
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,740
then there's an inverse.

128
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,920
And then there's a unique solution for any b.

129
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,080
And you might think that's the best possible case,

130
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,440
but, actually, it's kind of boring because, in finance, we

131
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,900
often like to find ways of constructing

132
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,310
new instruments for which there might be a demand.

133
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,180
And, sometimes, they are actually technically redundant,

134
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,400
but there's an interesting market use for them.

135
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,200
If n is bigger than s, though, and the matrix has rank s--

136
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,830
so, if n is bigger than s, of course, the rank of the matrix

137
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,580
can't be bigger than the smaller of the number of rows

138
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,550
and columns.

139
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,790
So, whether n is bigger or smaller than s,

140
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,270
the rank of a matrix can't be more than the number of rows

141
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,640
or the number of columns, whichever is smaller,

142
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,760
but, if n is bigger than s and the matrix has rank s,

143
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,450
then we have an overcomplete set of securities.

144
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,070
We have a redundant set.

145
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,380
What we can do is, to get a complete basis,

146
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,790
we can pick any s securities that are linearly independent,

147
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,760
have independent payoffs, and we can drop the extra ones.

148
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,730
So, in our example before, in the case

149
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,780
where we had the K equals 1 call option, we could drop that one

150
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,460
and keep the other three, which are linearly independent.

151
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,670
If we have more securities and more complicated matrices,

152
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,640
we just need a set of vectors that span the space.

153
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,660
So they can form a basis, provided

154
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,820
that they span the space and they have rank s.

155
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,850
And we can reduce things to a square matrix that

156
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,160
produces all of the payoffs.

157
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,490
So we have these properties for the rank of a matrix, which

158
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,590
you should review if they're not familiar, that, first of all,

159
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,860
that the rank of a matrix is equal to the rank

160
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,880
of a transpose.

161
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,380
And it's equal to the smaller-- it's

162
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,630
less than or equal to the smaller

163
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,180
of the number of the rows or columns that we have.

164
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,630
And, if we have a product of two matrices,

165
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,880
remember that, when we have linear transformations,

166
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,870
we usually read them from right to left

167
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,140
because that's the way in which they act on vectors.

168
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,880
And, if one transformation reduces the size of the space,

169
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,420
then that carries forward the rest of the way.

170
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,420
So, in a product, the rank of a product

171
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,270
is never going to be greater than the smaller of the rank

172
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,890
of the two matrices.

173
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,250
And, if I have a product of A times A transpose,

174
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,615
that's going to be equal to the rank of A.

175
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:19,115
