0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
PROFESSOR: So, in general, we have portfolios

1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,120
that are represented as a vector of the quantities held

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,530
for each security.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,670
Those are elements in Rn.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,970
And, when we act on it with A, we

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,910
have a linear payoff for the simple reason

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,330
that three stocks are worth three times more than one.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,990
500 bonds are worth 500 times more than a single bond.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,590
And the value of a bunch of stocks and bonds in a portfolio

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,240
is equal to the value of the stocks

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,990
plus the value of the bonds, perfect setting for linearity.

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,100
It's really not very complicated.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,490
So we have a portfolio to represent

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,690
the vector of quantities.

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,230
And the payoff matrix acts to tell us what the payoff is.

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,320
So, if I have this vector, which represents being short one

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,250
bond, long two shares of stock, short two call

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,790
options of strike 1 and 1/2, and short one call

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,770
option of strike 1, what is the payoff of this portfolio?

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,690
Well, the payoff of the portfolio

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,450
is a linear combination of the payoffs

21
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,950
of the individual assets.

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,863
And we get it by doing matrix multiplication.

23
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:09,780
And, if you check, you'll find that the payoff

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,970
of that particular portfolio vector

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,920
is 0 in the first state of the world,

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,660
1 in the second state of the world,

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,500
and 1 in the last state of the world.

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,220
And, if you want, you can either do the matrix multiplication,

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,290
or, in simple cases, you can notice

30
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,810
that what matrix multiplication really does

31
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,490
is it gives us a linear combination

32
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,810
of the columns in the matrix.

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,590
That is I'm taking minus 1 times this column

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,410
plus 2 times this column minus twice

35
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,910
this column minus this column.

36
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,730
And, when I take that linear combination,

37
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,100
it's the same thing as A times x, and I get this value.

38
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,680
So it's very simple.

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Given a vector x, you want to know the payoff.

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,700
You multiply with the matrix A. Do the matrix multiplication,

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,750
and there's your payoff.

42
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,058
What about going the other way around?

43
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:56,475
Would you have been able to answer

44
00:01:56,475 --> 00:02:02,940
if I asked you, here's A, here's the payoff I'd like to get--

45
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,539
0, 1, 1-- is there a portfolio that produces this payoff?

46
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,199
So this is actually, in many ways,

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,570
a fundamental question of the design

48
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,760
of financial instruments, which is, if there's

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,490
a demand for a particular kind of payoff,

50
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,330
is it possible to construct a portfolio of instruments that

51
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,060
are available in the marketplace that produces a desired payoff?

52
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,370
In a complete market, the answer is yes.

53
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,770
And, in incomplete market, the answer is no.

54
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,390


55
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,840
So, in other words, what we're asking

56
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,960
is how to solve a general linear equation.

57
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,210
And this is the most basic problem in linear algebra.

58
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,140
Suppose we have a payoff, a target, that we want

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,390
that's given by a vector b.

60
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,210
And we have a payoff matrix A. And we'd

61
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,940
like to solve the equation Ax equals b.

62
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,800
That is we'd like to find x, the portfolio, whose payoff is

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,340
some given constant that we've prespecified b.

64
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,930
So, as you know, in linear algebra,

65
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,290
this could be one number of equations

66
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,170
and some other number of variables.

67
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,430
We have s equations and n variables in this case.

68
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,870
And, depending on whether n is bigger or smaller or the same

69
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,840
as s and depending on some other relationships,

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,180
we might have a unique answer.

71
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,720
We might have multiple answers.

72
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,220
Or we might have none.

73
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,200
So let's take the simplest case.

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,938
If A is non-singular and there's a unique-- and n is equal to s,

75
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,230
then there's a unique solution.

76
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,510
If A is non-singular, we take the inverse.

77
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,690
x is equal to A inverse b, and we're done.

78
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,620
So what are the conditions required for that?

79
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,230
Well, A has to be invertible.

80
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,260
So the columns of A need to be independent.

81
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,790
The rows do also.

82
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,640
That means that the rank of A has to be full rank.

83
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,880
In our example, we could be 3 by 3.

84
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,800
The securities are not redundant.

85
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,610
That is there's no linear relationship among the payoffs

86
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,780
and the securities.

87
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,767
We can't write one of the columns

88
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,350
as a linear combination of the others.

89
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,300
That's what it means for them to be independent.

90
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,008
And we need the same number of securities

91
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:08,780
as states, obviously, for the matrix

92
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,300
to be square so it can be inverted.

93
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,070
What if n equals s doesn't hold?

94
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,079
Well, if n is less than s, if the number of securities

95
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,709
is smaller than the number of states in our financial model,

96
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,240
then, in general, there's not going to be any solution.

97
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,850
So, for an arbitrary b, there may not be a solution.

98
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,180
We just have more states than we have securities.

99
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,890
There's no way that we can solve the problem in general.

100
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,260
We might be able to solve it for some special cases.

101
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,320
So there might be some special b's--

102
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,780
that is vectors that lie in the image

103
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,270
space of the linear transformation A--

104
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,170
where there is a solution, but not for all possible b's.

105
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,470
So we might have, for example, a two-dimensional subspace

106
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,350
where there are certain payoffs that we could create,

107
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,050
but not any possible payoff.

108
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,260
On the other hand, what happens if we have more securities

109
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,320
than we have states?

110
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,900
Well, in that case, there might or might not be a solution.

111
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,600
But, in any event, they're probably not

112
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,880
unique because, if n is greater than s,

113
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,570
then some vectors need to get mapped to 0.

114
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,600
The target space is smaller than the initial space.

115
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,940
And that space of vectors that can mapped to 0

116
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,700
is known as the kernel or the null space.

117
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,110
And one of the interesting things

118
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,920
is, because A acting on an element of this null space

119
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,530
is equal to 0, we can add--

120
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,920
that means that an element of the null space or of the kernel

121
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,520
has zero payoff.

122
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,480
That means that we could add it to any portfolio

123
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,520
and still have the same payoff.

124
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,460
So these are our possibilities.

125
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,220
We could have n equal to s, n less than s, or n greater

126
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,910
than s.

127
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,860
What really is going to matter, though, is

128
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,960
the rank of the matrix.

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,470
So market completeness is defined as follows.

130
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,790
A complete market is one in which every possible payoff can

131
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,480
be generated by some portfolio.

132
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,760
One way to say that is that the image of A

133
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,160
is the full space of payoffs.

134
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,580
Another way to say it is that the rank of A is equal to s.

135
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,260
That is that the vectors that can

136
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,690
be reached by acting with A on something

137
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,090
is equal to the dimension of the target space.

138
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,880
And, equivalently, we could say that the linear transformation

139
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,800
is onto or surjective.

140
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,033
That means it covers the entire target space.

141
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:26,450
And, if the market isn't complete,

142
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,310
well, then it's incomplete.

143
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,530
So an incomplete market is one in which

144
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,410
there exists some payoffs that can't

145
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,120
be generated by any portfolio.

146
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,510
So that means that the image of A

147
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,050
is smaller than the entire space of payoffs.

148
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,207
So it's a proper subspace within the space of payoffs.

149
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,790
In the example I gave before, it would

150
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,100
be a space of lower dimensions.

151
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,762
Equivalently, the rank of A is less than s,

152
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,470
which is the number of independent states

153
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,260
of the world.

154
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,580
So, intuitively, we need for a complete market

155
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,010
to have at least as many securities

156
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,840
as there are states in the world.

157
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,000
That might not be enough because, if we

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,580
have a lot of securities, but the securities are really

159
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,000
just similar to each other, then they

160
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,270
may not generate anything new, but it's certainly necessary.

161
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,790
And, if we have fewer securities than states, than

162
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,470
we necessarily have an incomplete market.
