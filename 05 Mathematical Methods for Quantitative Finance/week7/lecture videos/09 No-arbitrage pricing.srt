1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,330
PROFESSOR: The answer is yes, provided

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,520
that the pricing relationships are

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,130
consistent with the redundant securities.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,740
That is, since the fourth security

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,070
can be thought of as a linear combination of the first two,

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,750
its price should be consistent with that.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,710
So, if the value of the fourth security,

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,070
the k equals 1 call option, is the price

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,480
of the stock minus the price of the bond

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,620
and it can be replicated by owning one share of the stock

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,640
and shorting one bond, then S times x,

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,877
the market value of the portfolio, of any portfolio,

13
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:38,960
is going to be consistent.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,020
And the market value of this portfolio is going to be 0.

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,030
So we have a rule.

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,260
We have a law.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,330
And it's called the law of one price.

18
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,450
The law of one price says that different portfolios

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,530
that have the same payoff have to have the same price.

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,910
That ensures an absence of arbitrage.

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,650
And it does mean that there are unique prices for securities

22
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,030
in the market.

23
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,570
Prices are linear.

24
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,430
So we have a linear combination of assets in a portfolio.

25
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,210
And, for valuing the portfolio, the market value

26
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,390
is going to be a linear combination of prices.

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,460
In mathematical terms and algebraic terms,

28
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,970
we would say that, if the payoffs are the same--

29
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,700
if I have two portfolios, x1 and x2,

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,440
the payoffs are the same if A acting on x1 is A acting on x2.

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,200
That says the two portfolios have the same payoff.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,090
Then S acting on x1 and S acting on x2 have be equal.

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,260
Notice that this equation involves a row vector

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,780
S acting on the vector--

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,010
on the vector x.

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,770
This is a matrix equation acting.

37
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,920
And this needs to hold for both vectors.

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,780
Now, we can rewrite this.

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,680
And we can subtract the A x2 from this equation,

40
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,390
and we can write this on the left

41
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,180
by saying that A acting on the difference

42
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,330
vector between x1 and x2 is 0.

43
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,110
Well, A acting on a vector that gives 0

44
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,530
says that x1 minus x2 is in the kernel of A.

45
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,180
It's a non-zero vector that is taken into 0 by the payoff

46
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,960
matrix.

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,210
It's an arbitrage portfolio.

48
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,510
If x1 equals x2, then this is trivial.

49
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,500
So we're always considering the non-trivial case.

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,660
That means-- again, doing the same trick,

51
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,620
subtracting on the second equation, that

52
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,610
means that the price of the arbitrage portfolio, x1

53
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,490
minus x2, has to be 0.

54
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,170
That's the law of one price.

55
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,130
We avoid arbitrage by saying that non-zero portfolios that

56
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,430
have zero payoffs must have zero price.

57
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,760
And that's required by the absence of type II arbitrage.

58
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,980
Now, we can use no-arbitrage pricing among the basis assets

59
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,935
to price any other asset with any portfolio.

60
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,310
And there are two ways that we might think about pricing.

61
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,070
We might think about relative and absolute pricing.

62
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,010
And, in this picture, like our derivative pricing models

63
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,930
that we looked at in continuous time,

64
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,880
we're thinking about relative pricing

65
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,180
of one asset relative to another or relative to a set of assets.

66
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,560
So no-arbitrage pricing tells us about relationships

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,440
that exist among assets given prices

68
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,030
of a certain set of assets.

69
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,820
If there are other assets that are not independent,

70
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,910
their prices need to be uniquely determined.

71
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,730
That's different from absolute pricing where

72
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,980
we say what the price of a stock should

73
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,590
be based on reading its balance sheet,

74
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,220
its earnings report, and so on, a bunch of external variables.

75
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,580
Here we're looking at self-consistent relationships

76
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,400
among securities that exist in a market.

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,760
And we don't have any view necessarily about how

78
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,200
that ties in to external observables

79
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,050
or values in the real world.

80
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,730


81
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,880
So we have the law of one price.

82
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,520
And, using this, we can ask whether a given

83
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,270
model of a marketplace is arbitrage free or not.

84
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,090
Furthermore, we can impose this as a constraint.

85
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,100
If we're thinking about building models

86
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,950
or we're thinking about introducing new securities

87
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,680
and designing new kinds of financial products,

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,589
we want to make sure that it's arbitrage free.

89
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,149
Certainly, if we're selling products,

90
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,460
we don't want to be the ones getting arbitraged.

91
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,370
We can take advantage of an arbitrage

92
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,810
with other participants.

93
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,060
That might be of interest, but, normally, we

94
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,735
would assume that everyone has the same insights,

95
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:35,150
the same information, and the same access.

96
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,490
And a sensible starting point and really a fairly

97
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,070
minimum requirement on any marketplace

98
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,930
is that it should be arbitrage free.

99
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,940
But this does give us constraints

100
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,100
on what might be present in the marketplace.

101
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,880
So this is going to lead us to the fundamental theorem

102
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,190
of asset pricing, at least in our simple, one-period model.
