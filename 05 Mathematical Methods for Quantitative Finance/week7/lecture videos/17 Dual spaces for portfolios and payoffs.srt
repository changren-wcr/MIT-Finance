1
00:00:00,892 --> 00:00:03,640
PROFESSOR: So we've got two ways of computing prices.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,910
One of them is in terms of market prices.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,980
The other is in terms of state prices.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,780
And I'd like to combine them by going back

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,060
to that diagram we drew earlier that

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,520
shows the algebraic notion of dual spaces

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,380
and take advantage of a couple of results from linear algebra.

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,270
So the idea is we want to relate the two.

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,250
And, when it comes time in practice,

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,560
you can use whichever one is convenient.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,350
The market prices are convenient in that we know

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,210
what traded securities are.

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,390
And it's very easy to associate prices with securities.

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,180
And those prices might be observable on the market.

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,000
But what it doesn't tell us is necessarily

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,920
what the market structure is and what

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,880
could happen in different scenarios

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,360
so that we make sure that everything is consistent.

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,360
On the other hand, state prices are very easy.

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,330
There are no-- there are no extra pieces moving around.

21
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,010
Nothing else is hiding.

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,530
And the reason for that, the difference between the two,

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,260
is that we don't introduce extra states of the world that

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,720
aren't observed where we might introduce redundant securities.

25
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,685
So our initial assumption at the beginning,

26
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:05,820
when we started talking about linear algebra,

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,090
was that the states of the world were mutually exclusive,

28
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,840
and they're non-overlapping.

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,380
So that's really the reason why things

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,380
are simpler in state space, but you can use whatever is easier.

31
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,060
So I'd like to do some algebraic relationships

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,290
with a few pictures.

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,360
What we're going to come back to is the thing

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,210
about matrices where you can use whichever language is

35
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,360
more convenient.

36
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,930
We often find that, for doing pricing,

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,810
it's easier to compute in terms of observables in the market

38
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,530
prices.

39
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,050
For understanding market structure, restrictions,

40
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,660
and bounds, that's much more natural

41
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,280
in terms of state prices.

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,530
And, if we have a dual picture, it

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,200
means that we can freely move back and forth from one

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,570
to the other and get the advantages of both worlds.

45
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,940
So let's see how that looks.

46
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,600
So this duality picture means that we can do things

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,950
in two different ways.

48
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,410
And, although it's a little bit formal,

49
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,030
we can get our pricing relationship very,

50
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,300
very quickly by thinking about two different ways

51
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,990
of computing the same thing.

52
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,650
So, first of all, let's review what a dual space is.

53
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,020
A dual space is a set of functions on a vector space.

54
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,520
So let's begin with a vector space of portfolios.

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,690
And I can act on it with security prices.

56
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,630
And it's linear because the price of two portfolios

57
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,730
is the sum of the price of each of the portfolios.

58
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,980
So the way I act specifically is I turn S into a row vector.

59
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,210
I act on x.

60
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,980
And that gives me a scalar, which is the price.

61
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,700
But S acting on x1 plus x2 is S acting

62
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,310
on x1 plus S acting on x2.

63
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,780
Through our old friend linearity,

64
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,320
I get the same price.

65
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,042
Now, these are two different vector spaces, each of which

66
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,500
has the same dimension because I've

67
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,420
got one price per security.

68
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,930
But, although they're both Rn, they are different spaces.

69
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,520
And we saw they have different units.

70
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,870
One of them is in dollars.

71
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,860
The other is in shares.

72
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,180
You can't add them.

73
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,520
So, because we have two different Rn's, let's

74
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,480
give them names.

75
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,860
Let's call the lower one, our asset space, V. It's Rn.

76
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,480
But the upper space, the price space,

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,190
the set of market prices, we'll call V star for the dual space.

78
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,780
And it's also Rn.

79
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,000
So there are two different vector spaces

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,380
of the same dimension.

81
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,670
One of them acts on the other.

82
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,430
And this is called a dual space because it

83
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,980
has the same dimension.

84
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,240
Now, on the right-hand side of the diagram,

85
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,810
we have an analogous situation.

86
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,490
We have a set of payoffs.

87
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,622
These are a state space, which is S-dimensional.

88
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:34,580
Let's give that a name.

89
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,370
We'll call it W. And it's S-dimensional.

90
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,790
So, before, we could call that RS,

91
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,540
but let's call it W now because there's another RS.

92
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,970
There's another S dimensional vector space,

93
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,620
and that's W star.

94
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,810
It's a set of state prices, which

95
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:55,270
act on payoffs to give also values for portfolios

96
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,550
and, this time, portfolios that are defined not

97
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,220
by their security composition, but by their payoffs

98
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,540
in each state of the world.

99
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,670
And the way we do that calculation is we

100
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,580
take a vector in the space W star.

101
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,650
We turn it into a row vector by taking

102
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,420
its adjoint or its transpose.

103
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,300
And then we multiply it times the payoff vector b.

104
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,620
And these two things have to be the same.

105
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,100
So you can use whichever one you want,

106
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,769
but our pricing relationship tells us

107
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,900
how to connect the two.

108
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,440
So our pricing relationship, S equals A star psi,

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,330
we can think of in the following way.

110
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,840
We have our payoff matrix A, which

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,590
maps V to W, which I've written up here.

112
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,200
It takes portfolios into payoffs.

113
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,170
We have A star, which goes in the other direction,

114
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,220
it takes this dual space W star into V star.

115
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,658
It's a transpose matrix.

116
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:47,950
So the dimensions all work out.

117
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,590
It takes an S-dimensional space into an n-dimensional space.

118
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,280
And now we can compute our pricing

119
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,240
for a portfolio in terms of its payoffs in two different ways.

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,350
And we'd better get the same answer.

121
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,190
So let's see how that works in dual language.

122
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,750
To compute the price of a portfolio

123
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,990
on the left side of the diagram, I take S transpose times x.

124
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,750
On the right side of the diagram,

125
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,410
I would take psi star times b.

126
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,430
But suppose b is the image of A. Suppose b

127
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,520
is the payoff of a portfolio x.

128
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,600
Then I would take psi star acting on A times

129
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,860
x, which I can write out here.

130
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,950
So it must be the case that the row vector

131
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:35,650
S acting on x is the same thing as the row vector psi acting

132
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,470
on the product A times x.

133
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,640
Now, notice that psi star times A is just

134
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,500
the transpose of something.

135
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,290
And remember the rule for matrices.

136
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,570
The transpose of a product is a product

137
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,330
of the transposes in the reverse order.

138
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,960
And, also, the transpose of a transpose does nothing.

139
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,400
So we can write this as A star psi transpose.

140
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,280
If we apply that here, then we get this equation over here.

141
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,390
But then we recognize that A star psi

142
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,710
is exactly what we hoped to find in our pricing relationship.

143
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,990
And, in fact, we have this quantity, A star psi,

144
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,400
this quantity in parentheses.

145
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,450
When we take its transpose and we act on it a vector x,

146
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:27,910
we get the same thing as S, take its transpose, and act on x.

147
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,520
Because x is arbitrary in these two cases,

148
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,400
the only way this is going to hold

149
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,330
is if we can identify S with A star psi.

150
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,640
That's required for consistency.

151
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,650
We don't yet know whether they're unique,

152
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,280
but it is required.

153
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,600
This says that we can price a portfolio either in terms

154
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,320
of market prices or using the payoff matrix

155
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,420
in terms of state prices.

156
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,300


157
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,450
Now, there are some special relationships

158
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,880
among these operators between their images

159
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,170
and their null spaces.

160
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,160
And let me just give you an example.

161
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,320
But here's the summary of the result.

162
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,170
We can say that anything in the kernel

163
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,670
of A star acting on anything of the image of A gives 0.

164
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,570
That's this annihilator operator.

165
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,110
You could think of it as being like orthogonality.

166
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,230
Or we also have the additional relationship

167
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,610
that anything in the image of A star acting on anything

168
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,930
in the kernel of A gives 0.

169
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,730
So let's see how that works.

170
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,210
Suppose we have an arbitrage portfolio.

171
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,360
That is an arbitrage portfolio is a portfolio that

172
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,010
has zero payoff.

173
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,920
A acting on x is equal to 0.

174
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,210
It has zero payoff.

175
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,410
It's what we call an arbitrage portfolio.

176
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,130
So saying it's the kernel of A is just a fancy name

177
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,590
for saying that Ax equals 0.

178
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,630
Now, suppose we act on it with a price vector,

179
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,470
but that price vector is in the image of A star.

180
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,900
Now, to be in the image of A star, that

181
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,340
means that we found some vector over here in W star,

182
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,190
acted on it with A star, and got a security price.

183
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,170
So that might not be all possible security prices,

184
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,070
but it certainly is some of them.

185
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,970
So to say that S is in the image of A star

186
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,670
means that S is A star acting on some psi for some vector that's

187
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,310
there.

188
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,560
It means there's at least one.

189
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,160
There could be more than one.

190
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,370
So suppose we have these two conditions.

191
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,860
And now let's let S act on x.

192
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,170
What do we have?

193
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,770
So we have an element of the image

194
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,580
of A star acting on an element of the kernel of A.

195
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,210
So S star acting on x is going to be-- because it's

196
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:41,809
in the image, S star is A star psi is S star acting on x.

197
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,370
Take the transposes.

198
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,970
That's going to be psi star A acting on x.

199
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,890
This matrix multiplication is associative.

200
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,140
So let's regroup.

201
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,520
Let's do a A times x first and then act on it with psi star.

202
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,190
A times x is equal to 0 by this condition

203
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,260
because it's an arbitrage portfolio.

204
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,670
And I get 0.

205
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,080
So fancy notation that relates these different subspaces,

206
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,300
but it's really just encapsulating

207
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,820
the basic rules of arbitrage when

208
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,870
we have redundant securities.
