00:00:01,162 --> 00:00:02,620
PROFESSOR: In an incomplete market,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,760
there can be multiple solutions psi.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,220
So, for example, consider an incomplete market,

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,590
which has two securities, a bond and a stock.

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,830
So there are three states, only two securities.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,210
Market is incomplete.

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,420
What are we going to do?

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,080
Well, suppose we're given the prices of the securities.

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,420
And suppose they're $1 for the bond and $2 for the stock.

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,300
The matrix A transpose that tells us

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,120
how to get from state prices to security

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,190
prices, the transposed matrix, is this 2 by 3 matrix, 1, 1, 1,

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,330
3, 2, 1.

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,010
We notice we can read off a solution

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,210
right away because the middle column here is 1, 2.

16
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,470
That's what we're looking for for S.

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,250
So, if A star, this transposed matrix,

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,260
were to act on the three vector, 0, 1,

19
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,410
0, that would solve our equation.

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,440
So that's obviously a solution for the state price vector psi.

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,590
But it's not good because it could allow arbitrage.

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,560
Remember that every element in the state price vector

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,800
has to be positive.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,860
None of its elements can be 0.

25
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,379
If they were 0, that would allow arbitrage.

26
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,110
But it's OK because there's one thing

27
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,970
that we haven't included yet, which

28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,220
is that A star has a kernel.

29
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,990
Because A is a 2 by 3 matrix, there is some vector--

30
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,610
there's some three vector--

31
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,650
that gets taken into 0 because we're

32
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,540
mapping a three-dimensional space

33
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,380
into a two-dimensional space.

34
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,200
And we can see what that vector is.

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,570
It's just 1, minus 2, 1.

36
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,640
That is, if you double the middle column,

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,410
it's equal to the sum of the first and the third columns.

38
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,610
So, if you act with A star on this vector, you get 0.

39
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,740
That means that we can add to 0, 1, 0 any multiple--

40
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,390
let's multiply by x--

41
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,100
of that vector.

42
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,980
Now, we want to choose x so that each component of psi

43
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,880
is a positive number.

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,830
So psi being strictly positive requires first

45
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,750
that x be strictly positive because

46
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,990
the first and third components are going to be equal to x.

47
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,820
And the middle component is going

48
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,800
to be equal to 1 minus 2x.

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,060
And that sets an upper bound on x,

50
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,850
which says that x has to be between 0 and 1/2.

51
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,420
And that tells us what the allowed state price

52
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,290
vectors are.

53
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,790
There are an infinite number of them

54
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,080
because x can be anywhere in this range.

55
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,730
Does that always work?

56
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,630
No.

57
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,750
Suppose the state price-- suppose the market price

58
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,370
vector had been 1, 1.

59
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,420
Then there's arbitrage.

60
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,350
We saw that earlier.

61
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,850
There's stochastic dominance.

62
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,980
There's not going to be any solution for psi.

63
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,780
And suppose, on the other hand, S

64
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,960
is equal to 1, 3, which is the first column.

65
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,520
So then we might try to write down this equation.

66
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,500
We could say that psi-- we try the same trick as before.

67
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,650
Because 1, 3 is the first column of A transpose,

68
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,450
we could say psi has to 1, 0, 0 plus some multiple

69
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,110
of the kernel, plus some multiple of 1, minus 2, 0.

70
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,530
But there isn't any value of x for which that's going to work.

71
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,100
The first-- the second component that says we're

72
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,380
going to have minus 2x, that tells us that x

73
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,860
has to be strictly negative.

74
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,860
The third component is going to be equal to x.

75
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,050
That says x has to be strictly positive.

76
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,480
x cannot be both positive and negative at the same time.

77
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,980
Therefore, there's no solution for any value of x.
