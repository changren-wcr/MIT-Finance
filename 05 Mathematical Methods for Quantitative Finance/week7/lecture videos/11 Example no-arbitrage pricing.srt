00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,440
PROFESSOR: So what did you find?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,230
You could either act with A on each of these vectors

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,200
and see what you get and see if you match the required payoff,

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,740
0, 0, 1, or you could throw it on a computer

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,770
and look at solving this system of linear equations.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,150
For example, in R, we can use the function qr.solve,

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,760
which will help us solve non-square systems

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,170
of linear equations.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,750
Here's A. Here's our target function.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,820
And this finds a vector x3 such that A acting on x3

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,555
is e3, 0, 0, 1.

12
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:36,555
And here's the solution.

13
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:39,770
And you notice this was one of the multiple-choice answers

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,070
that we had.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,920
But, if that's not the one you got,

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,810
don't worry too quickly because it was a little bit of a trick

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,310
question.

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,960
There was more than one answer.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,630
Because there's a non-zero kernel in our matrix A,

20
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,000
we could add any multiple of this

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,570
to any vector that does work as an AD security

22
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,527
and get another one.

23
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,360
And you'll see that one of the other choices

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,330
I gave you also works as well because it

25
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:12,290
differs by an element of the kernel of A.

26
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,610
So suppose we want to find the price of an AD security.

27
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,090
Well, first, we want to apply rules of no arbitrage.

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,960
So let's set the bond price equal to 1.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,940
And then, in those terms, the rest

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,450
of the bond prices, S2, S3, S4, are independent variables.

31
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,850
So now we have--

32
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,040
we'd like to impose that there's no type II arbitrage.

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,350
So we'd like the market price of our x tilde of our arbitrage

34
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,910
portfolio to be 0.

35
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,150
And that tells us that we have this relationship

36
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,030
among the remaining prices that S4

37
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,510
has to be equal to S2 minus S1.

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,220
So we use no arbitrage to fix the price of asset 4, which

39
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,450
was our second call option.

40
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,910
So what do we do?

41
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:05,110
We start with basis assets and our payoff matrix A.

42
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,139
We're given a set of prices in the market.

43
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,570
And maybe we can fix one of them.

44
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,420
We're given a redundant security, x

45
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,510
tilde, which is because our market is overcomplete.

46
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,740
So then its price is given by the linear price

47
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,110
of the replicating portfolio.

48
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,360
And, having fixed that, we can then

49
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,410
determine the price of everything else,

50
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,150
including now our third AD--

51
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,770
our first AD security over here because now we know what S4 is.

52
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,490
S4 is now fixed at S2 minus S1.

53
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,780
And we can compute in terms of now two, not

54
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,640
four independent prices.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,390
We can compute the value, the market price,

56
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:56,400
of this AD security as 1 minus S2 plus 2 S3.
