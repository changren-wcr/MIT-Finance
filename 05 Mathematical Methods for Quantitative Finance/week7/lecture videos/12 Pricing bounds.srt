1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,460
PROFESSOR: What can we say about non-redundant assets?

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,850
Well, suppose we've got a market with three states,

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,630
and we have only one security.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,270
So it's a very simple payoff matrix in this case.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,610
It's just a single column.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,379
And let's give that column a name.

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,790
Let's call it a1.

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,730
And the price vector is just going

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,370
to be a number because there's only one security.

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,650
And let's suppose that the market price is 2.

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,780
And let's ask if we've got another payoff.

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,570
Let's pick something, 1, 1, 2, which certainly is not

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,850
a multiple of 1, 2, 3.

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,640
Now, let's take a look at what constraints we have

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,830
and what we can say about prices.

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,790
What can we say about the price of the payoff

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,640
b, which is not in the marketplace?

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,550
So, remember, b would represent if there were a new security

19
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,390
to be created.

20
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,700
If you were to go out and create a new instrument

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,640
and you wanted to sell it in a marketplace

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,320
where the only instrument that existed

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,640
before was an instrument that had payoffs 1, 2, 3 and you

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,730
want to have an instrument that's payoff 1, 1, 2,

25
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,470
you'd certainly like to make sure it avoids arbitrage.

26
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,510
How could you do that?

27
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,390
Well, we do it by comparison with the existing marketplace.

28
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:21,370
So notice that, because a1 stochastically dominates

29
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,270
b, that because, in every state, each element is

30
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,680
bigger or less than--

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,560
excuse me, bigger or greater than the corresponding elements

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,640
over here, then we must have that S1

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,320
has to be greater than a price that

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,480
would be associated with Sb.

35
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,640
So, if this were to be traded or if we

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,040
were to consider this combination of payoffs,

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,480
the price associated with it must be less than S1.

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,510
But we can also get a bound on the other side.

39
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,190
Notice that, if I take one half of a1, then all of my values

40
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,870
are less than those in b.

41
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,110
And, therefore, Sb has to be greater than half

42
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,820
of the price of S1.

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,860
So we can say that, in this case,

44
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,330
Sb must be between 1 and 2.

45
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,479
It can't be equal because there would be an arbitrage.

46
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,410
But Sb is allowed to exist in a range avoiding arbitrage

47
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,480
somewhere between 1 and 2.

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,000
If the market had been complete, then we

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,870
would have had unique prices, but, in an incomplete market,

50
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,630
we get price inequalities for what

51
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,340
might be allowed if there were to be

52
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,620
new securities with new payoffs that

53
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,500
don't correspond to linear combinations of existing

54
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,200
securities.

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,450
Let's generalize things a little bit more

56
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,280
and look a little bit more systematically

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
at how we get those results, apart

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,620
from doing it by inspection.

59
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,240
So we've got our vector a1, which

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,790
is 1, 2, 3, which is part of our payoff matrix.

61
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,260
We have a price vector, and we have a target payoff vector.

62
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,500
So let's construct the general linear combination, b

63
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,610
minus lambda a, for arbitrary lambda.

64
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,730
Well, what we'd like to do is consider the potential points

65
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,000
of interest where the entries change sign.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,730


67
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,500
That will give us the points where

68
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,560
we have stochastic dominance and constraints when

69
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,670
all of the remaining signs go positive or negative.

70
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,980
So, if we do this, we can find out that, as we vary lambda,

71
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,050
for lambda equal to 1, which was our first case,

72
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,890
we find that's the turning point where one of the elements

73
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,365
goes to 0 and the others go negative.

74
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:32,860
At lambda equals 1/2, two of the elements go positive,

75
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,910
and one goes to 0.

76
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,730
And lambda equals 2/3 is not as interesting

77
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,980
because, although we set one of them to 0,

78
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,180
the other two securities in this portfolio have opposite sign.
