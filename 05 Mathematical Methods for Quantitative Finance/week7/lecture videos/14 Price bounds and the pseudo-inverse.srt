1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,400
PROFESSOR: Our basic pricing relationship

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,430
between security prices and state prices

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,230
is that s is equal to A transpose psi, or A star psi.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,710
This is the adjoint.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,059
So A is a payoff matrix where we n securities,

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,490
and market securities in the world.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,730
There are s states of the world that are independent.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,140
We can associate a market price with each of the n securities.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,910
We associate a state price, and there

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,220
may be a different number of them, one state

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,049
price for each state of the world,

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,720
1, 2, 3, 4, up through s.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,430
So the relationship that we expect

14
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,160
is that the prices to be consistent

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,420
need to satisfy that s is equal to A star psi.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,680
And there's no arbitrage if and only if the state price

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,880
vector is strictly positive.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,720
So we need the state prices to be positive

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,510
because each state price corresponds

20
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,390
to some portfolio that has a payoff that is either positive,

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,430
in fact, it specifically positive in one state

22
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,150
of the world and 0 in others.

23
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,770
So the state prices must be greater than 0 in order

24
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,690
to avoid type 2 arbitrage.

25
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,730
And they must obey this relationship

26
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,190
to be consistent with the security prices.

27
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,930
Because the payoff matrix takes securities into payoffs,

28
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,900
and therefore A star is what relates

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,870
how we relate security--

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,630
excuse me-- state prices back to security prices.

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,990
So we've seen this for complete markets.

32
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,040
And in incomplete markets, there could be multiple solutions.

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,590
There could be an infinite number of solutions for psi.

34
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,580
So if there's at least one solution where psi is always

35
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,890
greater than 0, then we're guaranteed

36
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,360
that there's no arbitrage.

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,380
If all the solutions have psi less than or equal to 0,

38
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,620
then there will be arbitrage in the marketplace.

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,100
So it's helpful to diagram these relationships

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,140
in terms of dual spaces.

41
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,400
So I talked before about the left-hand side of the diagram.

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,560
He said that we have one vector space of portfolios.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,440
And in our starting example, this was of dimension four.

44
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,150
We had four securities.

45
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,130
And we could construct portfolios

46
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,710
that are linear combinations of quantities of securities.

47
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,970
So each element of a vector in this space

48
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,570
represent how many of each kind of security we have.

49
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,570
There's another space of identical dimension

50
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,260
of security prices.

51
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,410
And, in this case, there's one price

52
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,750
associated with each security.

53
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,820
Now, we have a vector, excuse me,

54
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,650
we have a matrix A, the payoff matrix, that maps portfolios,

55
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,750
it acts on portfolios.

56
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,930
It's a linear transformation, and it produces eigenvectors

57
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,240
of a different dimension, which I've drawn over here

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,600
in this other vector space, that's the space of payoffs

59
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,790
of some different dimension s.

60
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,490
So A acting on x gives us a payoff b.

61
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,610
If we want to know the price of a portfolio x,

62
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,040
we act on it with the security price

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,840
vector s by taking a row vector of s times a column vector x.

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,330
And now we see we can do exactly the same thing

65
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,690
in terms of payoffs.

66
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,210
If I've got a payoff matrix b, maybe I know the portfolio it

67
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,650
came from, maybe I don't.

68
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,080
But if I've got a payoff matrix b,

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,360
then I know what its price has to be

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,380
by acting with state prices.

71
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,870
So the state prices might take a row vector.

72
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,410
I act on the payoffs b as a column vector.

73
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,450
And that also gives me the price,

74
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,280
and those prices need to match.

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,000
In order for that to hold it has to be the A transpose, which

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,550
is the matrix which takes me from state

77
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,790
prices back to security prices has

78
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,170
to give us a relationship that s is equal to A star psi.

79
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,200
And then we'll have a consistent set of pricing relationships.

80
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,240
Why do we bother going through all this?

81
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,250
Because we know what no arbitrage looks

82
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,360
like on the right side of the diagram.

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,850
We don't know necessarily what it

84
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,710
looks like on the left side of the diagram.

85
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,502
Because that's just however the marketplace

86
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,580
happened to be described, whatever the securities

87
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,090
are, options, bonds, stocks, many different states

88
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,780
of the world.

89
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,790
But the right-hand side is very clear.

90
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,220
The right-hand side, there's one state for--

91
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,100
there's one dimension for each state of the world.

92
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,350
The state prices have to be positive.

93
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,470
We have a natural association of what the basis vectors are,

94
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,860
and therefore we can build up any payoff

95
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,570
or linear combinations and immediately determine

96
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,665
no arbitrage prices.

97
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:30,340


98
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,020
Here's an example.

99
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,700
Suppose we're given market with payoff matrix

100
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,890
A and a particular price vector s.

101
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,160
So is there arbitrage in this market?

102
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,300
Well, A is an invertible, but there

103
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,390
is a pseudo-inversion, which is a standard construction

104
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,800
in linear algebra.

105
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,810
And let me just show you how it works.

106
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,390
That if we construct this quantity,

107
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,830
AA transpose inverse times A, this

108
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,720
satisfies the interesting property

109
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,570
that if I multiply by A transpose

110
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,540
on the right-hand side as I do over here,

111
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,460
I get the identity matrix.

112
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,470
It's a 3-by-3 identity matrix.

113
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,440
It's not a 4-by-4, which would be the normal invertible case.

114
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,000
So it's not exactly invertible, but the pseudo-inverse

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,920
can act on a particular subspace.

116
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,740
And you can check that that's true here.

117
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,290
In terms of the pseudo-inverse, now I

118
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,410
have a chance of taking a look and finding a solution

119
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,980
for the state price vector.

120
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,030
If I take a look, if I act with the pseudo-inverse,

121
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,350
this 3-by-4 matrix, and I act on the state price

122
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,580
s, then I get this vector, which has positive numbers, which

123
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,000
is a good sign.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,440
And how do we check?

125
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,790
Well, we can check that this satisfies the pricing equation

126
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,090
by acting on the left with A transpose.

127
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,230
And A transpose acting on the left, acting on psi,

128
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,110
gives us our original pricing vector.

129
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,620
So that's the sense in which M is a pseudo-inverse.

130
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,070
Because if we multiply on the right by A star,

131
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,140
it gives us this identity.

132
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,820
And this helps us in this case solve for what the state price

133
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,720
vectors are.

134
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,390
We find that the state price vectors are positive,

135
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,490
and therefore there's no arbitrage.

136
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,800


137
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,210
What other prices are allowed?

138
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,470
Well, that was a particular value.

139
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,590
Suppose I let the third security price vary, and I let it be x.

140
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,340
So, in that case, we can use our pseudo-inverse

141
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,170
to solve this problem, as well.

142
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,020
We have psi is equal to n acting on s, the prices.

143
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,630
And now we notice that it has this form.

144
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,810
Now, it's going to depend on x, it's

145
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,370
a set of linear combinations.

146
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,860
But now we need to impose the condition.

147
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,050
Before, for a particular value of x

148
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,510
that I had on the previous slide, it just checked.

149
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,600
And all the state prices were positive.

150
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,980
But now the state prices are a function of x.

151
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,470
We need to check, we need to enforce

152
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,290
that all of these components of this matrix--

153
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,120
excuse me, of this vector, be positive.

154
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,250
So let's do that.

155
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,980
2x minus 1 has to be greater than 0.

156
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,800
That implies it has to be bigger than a 1/2.

157
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,870
Minus 4x plus 3 is 3 greater than 0.

158
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,200
That tells us that x has to be less than 3/4.

159
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,340
So we have that x is between a 1/2 and 3/4.

160
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,122
And we noticed the third condition

161
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:27,580
is the same as the first condition.

162
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,320
It doesn't give us anything new.

163
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,890
So if x is anywhere between a 1/2 and 3/4,

164
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,730
that's an allowed security price that will not allow arbitrage.

165
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,860
So if x is equal to 0.7, we would get a state price

166
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,320
vector 0.4, 0.2, 0.4.

167
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,530
All of those values are positive, and we're OK.

168
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,770
We're in good shape.

169
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,890
There's no arbitrage.

170
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,990
Suppose we let another price vary.

171
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,000
So we had one price fixed, the first price of the bond fixed

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,430
so we could scale things.

173
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,180
We had the fourth price fixed by no arbitrage,

174
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,720
I have type two arbitrage.

175
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,940
We let the third price vary, now let's let the final price vary.

176
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,620
Now we've got two parameters to solve for, x and y.

177
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,420
And we have a range of prices.

178
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,320
And for each value of x and y we have a different possible state

179
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,450
price vector, which will be given

180
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,880
by this linear combination of assets.

181
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,510
And now we need to ask, what values of x and y

182
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,830
keep us from having arbitrage?

183
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,700
That's in terms of state prices, and will automatically

184
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,260
tell us what are the allowed prices in the marketplace.
