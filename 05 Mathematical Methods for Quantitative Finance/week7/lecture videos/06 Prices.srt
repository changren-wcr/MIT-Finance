1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,120
PROFESSOR: What about security prices?

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,650
So far, we just talked about payoffs, future payoffs

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,960
for securities.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,860
What about the prices?

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,250
And why do we talk about payoffs instead of returns

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,530
on securities, how we usually think about it?

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,800
Well, for prices, let's represent them by a vector S.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,608
And what's the dimension of the space?

9
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:22,650
Well, it's going to be n.

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,010
There's going to be one price for each security in our space.

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,250
And, if we want to compute the market value of a portfolio,

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,740
we use the standard rule for computing the market

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,360
value of any portfolio.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,051
We take the quantity of securities, x

15
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:38,010
sub i of security of type i.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,930
We multiply times the price.

17
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,520
And we sum over the portfolio.

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,660
We can write this in matrix notation

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,880
as a row vector times a column vector.

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,260
Or we can flip it around the other way.

21
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,600
So think of S is related to the adjoint, which can

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,370
be written with a transpose.

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,560
It can be written with a star sometimes.

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,130
But this just means that we're taking S, turning it

25
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,080
into a row vector, and multiplying

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,700
times a column vector x.

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,470
It's another way of saying we're just

28
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,200
taking the linear sum of each component of S

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,760
times each component of x.

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,380
The key thing here is, first, we have one price per security

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,830
in our portfolio and, second, that the pricing

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,000
we can think of as a linear operation on portfolio vectors.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,060
And I can write it like this as S acting on the vector

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,430
x, which gives us a real number, which

35
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,090
would be the market value.

36
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,350
Now, in setups where we're thinking about applications

37
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,550
in derivative pricing, we often talk about future payoffs.

38
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,030
And, later on, we don't talk about the return on a security

39
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,860
because we sometimes are going to talk

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,320
about arbitrage portfolios and portfolios that

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,010
might have zero value.

42
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,280
And, if they have non-zero payoffs on the future,

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,960
then they would have infinite return

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,477
if we're dividing by something.

45
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:55,560
So we're going to talk about payoffs because those

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,352
are positive numbers that we're going to have in the future.

47
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,810
And, generally, they're going to be

48
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,170
non-zero values for securities, but we're not

49
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,740
having any denominators.

50
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,930
So we're only going to keep the numerators.

51
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,470
So we've seen that we have a vector space of portfolios,

52
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,970
so of dimension, in our starting example, of 4.

53
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,190
We have a vector space of prices,

54
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,390
which is the same dimension, but it's not the same vector space.

55
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,180
Remember, in a vector space, you can add vectors,

56
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,030
but prices are measured in dollars.

57
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,980
The portfolio space, they're measured

58
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,650
in shares or numbers or quantities of bonds.

59
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:40,460
And you can't add $10 per share, the value of S, to 15 shares.

60
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,380
You can multiply them and get something,

61
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,210
which dollars per share times shares

62
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,920
gives you something in dollars, but you

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,400
can't add them together.

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,130
So these are two quantities, which

65
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,200
are both vectors, S and x.

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,170
We can multiply them in this way to get a scalar.

67
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,510
But, even though they're of the same dimension,

68
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,410
we don't add them.

69
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,630
They're actually in different vector spaces,

70
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,770
which are called dual spaces.

71
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,300
One of them is dual to the other if it has the same dimension

72
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,890
and it acts linearly.

73
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,900
That's why, in this picture, we can

74
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,760
think of prices as acting on portfolios to give us

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
market values.
