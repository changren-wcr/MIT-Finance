00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,110
PROFESSOR: So the reason that the state prices

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,890
can be valuable is because we can now characterize

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,150
all possible payoffs in terms not just of security prices,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,910
but in terms of the values of the payoffs, which we know need

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,900
to have positive state prices.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,410
So the state prices need to be positive

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,820
because the payoffs of the elementary AD securities

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,750
are positive.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,060
And, in a complete market, all of the payoffs

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,220
can be replicated, and they all have a unique price.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,390
So we have positive state prices if and only

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,710
if there's no arbitrage.

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,550
If the prices are 0 or negative, then there's arbitrage.

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,880
We can take some of the AD securities as basis assets,

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,600
take those portfolios as basis assets in our original space.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,100
If we drop the set of redundant securities

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,813
and we choose as a basis the AD securities,

18
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:56,230
then we'd have a very simple description of our securities

19
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:56,730
market.

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,590
The payoff matrix would just be the identity.

21
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,620
But we know, in any event, that the payoff--

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,120
that the price for any positive payoff, vector b,

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,010
is given by the linear combination of the state

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,910
prices times the payoffs of those portfolios.

25
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,690
So it's given by psi star b where

26
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,790
psi is the vector of state prices

27
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,040
and b is the vector of payoffs.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,460
So, in terms of the original assets,

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,680
let's see how we can rewrite this.

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,490
If we write this in terms of the first column of A--

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,400
let's let the first column of A be denoted a1--

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,580
then the price of it is given by the state price

33
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,520
vector acting on its payoff.

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,590
All right, so we take our first-- for example,

35
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,680
in our original matrix A of 3, 2, 1,

36
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,020
if we have a set of state prices,

37
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,030
the state prices applied to the first column give a value S1,

38
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,240
and that would be the market price of the security that

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,370
corresponds to the payoff a1.

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,300
Similarly, S2, the market price of a2,

41
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,360
is related to the state prices by letting the state price

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,650
vector act on the second column of the payoff matrix and so on.

43
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,860
Now, if we group these together, we notice,

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,970
if we form a column vector of these, of S1, S2, S3,

45
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,150
we notice that we could write this as a matrix equation.

46
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,590
That is we could say that the row vector S

47
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,160
star is equal to psi star acting on the payoff matrix.

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,590
Because this is a row vector, it acts in turn

49
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,080
on each of the column vectors in A.

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,550
Finally, we can use the rule that the transpose of a product

51
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,770
is the product of the transposes in the opposite order.

52
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,970
So the transpose of a row vector is a column vector.

53
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,820
This gives us S. And the transpose

54
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,400
of psi transpose A of a row vector times a matrix is--

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,420
the transpose is going to be A transpose times psi where

56
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,170
psi is a column vector.

57
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,240
So now we have a relationship between market prices and state

58
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,140
prices.

59
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,100
The market prices are given in terms of the state prices

60
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,400
by multiplying times the transpose of the payoff matrix.
