PROFESSOR: The fundamental theorem of asset pricing

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,150
characterizes no arbitrage conditions in a marketplace.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,480
It says that there is no arbitrage in a market if

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,530
and only if there exists a state price vector whose components

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,520
are strictly positive, and it's consistent with the market

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,010
prices, through our pricing relationship,

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,540
that we can get the security prices by A transpose acting

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,150
on the state price vector, all of whose components

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,330
are positive.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,630
Now, it has an if and only if component.

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,178
And one direction is easy.

12
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:34,720
And that's the one we're going to do.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,100
The other direction is hard.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,093
It involves a theorem about separating hyperplanes.

15
00:00:39,093 --> 00:00:41,510
And I'll leave it to you to take a look at the literature.

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,360
But, this one, we can use what we've done,

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,280
and it's very easy to show.

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,100
Let's see how it goes.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,480
We have type I and type II arbitrage,

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,680
and we'd like to exclude them both.

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,700
So, first, let's look at the absence of type I arbitrage.

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,020
Suppose that I've got a portfolio with a payoff that's

23
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,980
greater than 0.

24
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,510
Remember what we mean here.

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,930
We mean that it has to have no non-negative payoffs,

26
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,210
and at least one of the components of b

27
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,870
has to be positive.

28
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:14,200
So our statement of no type I arbitrage

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,140
is that, if we have a positive payoff,

30
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,470
if we have this condition, then the price of this portfolio

31
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,030
must be strictly positive.

32
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,320
It can't be 0.

33
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,770
It can't be negative.

34
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,650
We can't get something for nothing.

35
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,820
So how do we show this?

36
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,980
Well, let's compute the price.

37
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,950
S star x is the price.

38
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,620
That's equal, via our pricing relationship,

39
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,460
to psi star A, acting on the portfolio x.

40
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,880
We can use associativity of our matrices.

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,350
That's the same as psi star acting on A times x.

42
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,520
But that Ax is the payoff of our portfolio b.

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,500
And that psi star b, because psi has only positive components,

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,230
and b has at least one positive component

45
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,360
and no negative components, this is

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,720
going to be the sum of positive numbers or 0.

47
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,229
And, therefore, it has to be greater than 0.

48
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,150
Done, one line.

49
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,420
Absence of type II arbitrage, suppose that we

50
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,370
have an arbitrage portfolio.

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,640
That is, suppose I have a portfolio that's non-zero.

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,100
So I do have securities in my portfolio.

53
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,450
But they're combined in such a way that the payoff is 0.

54
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,630
One way we do that is by having a security

55
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,110
held long and other securities that replicate it held short.

56
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,200
We saw that in the example of replicating

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,690
an option in terms of other securities in the portfolio.

58
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,190
So, if I have a non-trivial portfolio that has a zero

59
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,030
payoff--

60
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,190
that happens when we have a redundant asset

61
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,860
in our marketplace-- then the absence of type

62
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,240
II arbitrage says, if you've got an arbitrage portfolio,

63
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,880
then its price must be 0.

64
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,660
In other words, the value of redundant assets

65
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,440
needs to be uniquely determined by independent assets

66
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,740
in the marketplace.

67
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,740
So that's what we require.

68
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,060
How do we show it?

69
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,590
Let's compute the price.

70
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,760
S star x, the value of the arbitrage portfolio,

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,930
is going to be given by psi star A acting on x,

72
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,600
but A times x is 0.

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,790
And, therefore, it's equal to 0.

74
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,240
So that's shown one direction of the fundamental theorem

75
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,850
of asset pricing and how we can be sure

76
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,270
that we have consistent prices in the marketplace that don't

77
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,230
allow arbitrage, even when markets are incomplete

78
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,940
or when there are redundant securities.
