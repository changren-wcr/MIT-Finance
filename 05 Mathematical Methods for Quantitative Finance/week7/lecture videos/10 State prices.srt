1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,340
PROFESSOR: What are state prices?

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,090
We have a model which has, say, three states of the world.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,920
And we began by describing things

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,230
in terms of natural basis vectors.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,710
We introduced one element of our-- one dimension

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,590
of our vector space for each security we had.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,390
And what we'd like to do is do something

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,360
in a corresponding way with respect to the payoff space.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,590
So we'd like to think about having one security or one

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,370
portfolio that's associated with each possible state

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,750
of the world.

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:39,320
Now, to do that, we've talked about associating

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,900
states of the world with different payoffs.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,240
So a natural thing that we could look for

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,850
is a security or a portfolio that

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,890
has unit payoff in each state of the world.

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,220
Remember, we began with basis vectors

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,220
where a unit vector in our n-dimensional space

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,150
corresponded to one unit of a bond, one unit of a stock,

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,410
one unit of a given security.

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,060
So these securities are known as Arrow-Debreu securities.

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,520
We'll call them AD securities for short.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,010
And they're not necessarily tradable securities.

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,430
They're portfolios of tradable assets within our original set.

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,610
So we'll call them securities, but they're really

26
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,960
different portfolios.

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,540
And they have the property, if they exist,

28
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,280
that they are portfolios that have unit payoff so

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,460
that A acting on x gives us either 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, or so

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,820
on, wherever we are.

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,090
So, if we've got a marketplace where

32
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,330
there are s such securities or portfolios,

33
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,580
then the payoff matrix in terms of them

34
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,410
would be the identity matrix.

35
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,920
The first AD security would have payoff one in the first state,

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,020
the second one in the second, and so on.

37
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,190
And the payoff matrix would be diagonal.

38
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,180
So that would obviously be a very convenient state

39
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,330
of affairs.

40
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,900
So, in terms of a general payoff matrix,

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,870
the AD security could be replicated

42
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,497
if we have some portfolio such that, when A acts on it,

43
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:07,830
we get a unit vector, but this unit vector, remember, is

44
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,270
in the target space, not in our original space.

45
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,120
So it's in the space of payoffs.

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,900
So, if A acting on x has the form of a unit vector

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,080
where the payoffs are 0 in all of the states

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,870
except they're 1 in one of the states,

49
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,060
those help us form a basis for the space of payoffs.

50
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,700
Now, if A is invertible, then things are pretty nice.

51
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,960
Then we know what they are.

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,330
If A is invertible, then I can immediately

53
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,500
solve for the AD securities by taking A inverse acting on unit

54
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,410
vectors in the target space.

55
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,700
The prices of AD securities are called state prices.

56
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,350
So we think about these vectors or portfolios, hypothetically,

57
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,210
that have unit payoff.

58
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,340
Because they've got a positive payoff,

59
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,230
they should have a positive price associated with them.

60
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,070
And, if we collect all of those different prices, the price

61
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,960
of AD security 1, 2, 3, and so on into a vector with values

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,920
that we'll call psi 1, psi 2, up through psi s,

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,830
those prices are called state prices.

64
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,820
By our rules for no arbitrage, they have to be positive.

65
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,430


66
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,750
Let's take a look at an example.

67
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,640
Suppose we have a payoff matrix, our old friend

68
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,710
A, this 4 by 3 matrix.

69
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,880
And suppose I consider these vectors, x1 and x2.

70
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,860
Well, I'm on my way.

71
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,520
A acting on x1 is equal to 1, 0, 0.

72
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,220
If you take a look at that, we have unit payoff.

73
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,970
If I take this column plus twice this column

74
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,160
and I subtract this column, I'm left

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,620
with unit payoff in the first state

76
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,750
and 0 in the other two states.

77
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,790
And you should check that.

78
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,580
Similarly, for the second state, I

79
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,440
can do it with this portfolio.

80
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,690
If I have A acting on--

81
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,830
excuse me, my pointer is lost.

82
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,000
So A acting on the first portfolio gives this result.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,550
A acting on the second portfolio gives this result--

84
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,080
0, 1, 0.

85
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,340
So we can call x1 the first Arrow-Debreu security.

86
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,310
It's really a portfolio in terms of our stocks and bonds

87
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,709
and call options, but this portfolio

88
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,960
has this important property that it has unit payoff in one state

89
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,950
and zero payoff in the other states.

90
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,860
So it's A acting on x is a basis vector in the space of payoffs.

91
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,570
This gives us a basis vector with 1 in the second state

92
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,470
and 0 in the other states.

93
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,020
So what do you think?

94
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,670
Can you find a vector x3 that satisfies the property

95
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,220
that, when the payoff matrix acts

96
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,280
on x3, which is a four-vector, it pays off 0, 0, 1?

97
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,630


98
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,280
Let me give you a few choices to consider.

99
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,160
So here's a question.

100
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,720
What portfolio replicates the AD security for state 3?

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,300
And here are four choices--

102
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,700
a, b, c, and d.

103
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,510
Take a look, and see which one of these possible portfolios

104
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,500
could serve as our third AD security, which has

105
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,600
unit payoff only in state 3.
