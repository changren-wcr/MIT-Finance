1
00:00:00,682 --> 00:00:02,890
PROFESSOR: When we derived the Black-Scholes equation

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,280
in lecture, it had two parts.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,040
An expression for the stock dynamics is an Ito process

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,000
and then an expression for the derivative the

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,340
used Ito's lemma.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,090
And then we combine the two in a portfolio, canceled the risk,

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,390
and found a partial differential equation, which

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,820
had no risk in it, and then we can solve that

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,350
by ordinary techniques.

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,700
Now one thing that we might ask is,

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,390
what if stocks don't follow random walks?

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,990
What if stocks don't follow geometric Brownian motion?

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,310
How important is that?

14
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,460
Does the whole option-pricing relationship fall apart?

15
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,000
Quite the opposite.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,930
So let's take a look.

17
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,450
Suppose we have a general Ito process, where we have dS,

18
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,320
is given by any function, a times

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,050
dt plus any other function b of t and S times dB,

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,640
times the random part.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,620
Let's see what happens in our derivation.

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,110
Which parts go through and which parts change.

23
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,420
So remember when we did it before, we had previously,

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:16,560
this was dS was equal to uSdt plus sigma S dB.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,036
So these were very special forms of coefficient functions. a

26
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:23,010
and b in particular, they're time independent,

27
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,103
they're linear in S. And that's it.

28
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:27,270
So those were quite special, but let's leave a and b

29
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,160
completely general.

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,480
So that was one part.

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,410
The other part we're going to leave identical.

32
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:39,570
So let's let V is going to be a general function of t and S, is

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:48,070
the value of the derivative security

34
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,000
on the underlying security whose price is given by S.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,630
And you notice some places, I've had little subscripts, t,

36
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,650
on my variables.

37
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,270
From now on, generally, I'm going

38
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,000
to assume that we know that our capital letters are

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,610
random variables, they're stochastic processes,

40
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,140
and that they're time dependent.

41
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,820
In our coefficient functions, a and b and F and V,

42
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,550
our value functions, are going to be ordinary functions

43
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,840
but they're functions of random variables.

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,650
So sometimes it was convenient to put a little subscript, t,

45
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,550
down here and over here, to remind us that these

46
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,480
are the random variables.

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,160
But by now it should be clear in context that S or x or V

48
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,800
are always going to be functions, possibly

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,650
explicitly of time, but they're going to be random variables.

50
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,250
And those random variables are time dependent.

51
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,060
OK.

52
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,160
So what did we have for dV?

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,320
Well, dV was given because it's a derivative,

54
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,780
it doesn't have any choice.

55
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,690
It depends on S. And what it depends on also is Ito's lemma

56
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,090
and that's just math.

57
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,420
So it's given by--

58
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,300
excuse me, we're working in v instead of f.

59
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Just a different part of the alphabet for a change.

60
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,160
And it's conventional in literature,

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,650
when we're talking about derivatives,

62
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,260
that you can pick your favorite letter.

63
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,630
So this is going to be partial of v with respect to tdt.

64
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,805
Partial of v with respect to SdS.

65
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:21,505


66
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,710
And then, plus the Ito term, which

67
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:29,110
will be b squared over 2, second partial of F with respect to S

68
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,020
squared dt.

69
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,920
OK.

70
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,100
So this b over here is the same one as this coefficient there.

71
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,060
So all I've done is I've just left us in more general form.

72
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,680
Let's follow the same steps.

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,140
So this is, just to mark this up a little bit,

74
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,700
this defines dynamics of the underlying.

75
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,290


76
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,676
This is just Ito's lemma.

77
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:11,020
We'll call it Ito's formula for V.

78
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,260
And now we'd like to build a portfolio.

79
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,940


80
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,450
In our portfolio, pi will consist

81
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,490
of being long one derivative and minus a quantity, q,

82
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,500
that I'll give the name delta, in this case.

83
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,220
Think of them as shares of stock.

84
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,720
So I have delta shares of stock with value S.

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,000
So this is the value of the portfolio,

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,610
and then we'd like to ask about its change of value,

87
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,900
its differential.

88
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:50,380
So we have d pi, is going to be dV minus delta dS.

89
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,050
And when we combined terms, we saw

90
00:04:53,050 --> 00:05:00,630
that this was terms with a dt times partial of V

91
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,280
with respect to t.

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,590
That comes from up here.

93
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:15,510
| have my Ito term, it's going to be plus b squared over 2.

94
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,440
Second partial of V with respect to S squared.

95
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,500


96
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,510
And then I'm going to have a term, which

97
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:34,890
is going to be plus dS, and it's going to have partial of V

98
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,610
with respect to S from right here.

99
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,910
And it's going to have a delta term

100
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,040
from here, which is delta dS.

101
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,950
And because it's written in that form I really

102
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,440
don't want to go to the trouble of expanding out this dS,

103
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,100
writing it in terms of its original defining parts, do I?

104
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,850
Because I can cancel it out right there where it sits.

105
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,670
So our strategy was let's let delta equal partial

106
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,880
of V with respect to S. That makes

107
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,000
the risky term on the right, on the second term

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,980
of the right hand side, vanish.

109
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,510
And then we can have an expression

110
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,330
for a risk free portfolio.

111
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:33,670
So if we set delta equal to partial of V with respect to S.

112
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,150
If we do this, then two things happen.

113
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:48,545
That risky term in dS vanishes.

114
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:56,430


115
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,110
So that's one.

116
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:05,130
And two, we would say that pi earns the risk free rate.

117
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,827


118
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:10,535
Rate of interest.

119
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:14,950


120
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,330
Because otherwise it would be arbitrage.

121
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:23,720
So in that case, we have the d pi is going to be equal,

122
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,010
on the one hand, dt times the first term and that's it.

123
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,450
The second one will drop out.

124
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:38,420


125
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,960
And this has to be equal to the risk

126
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:51,080
free rate of growth, which will be r pi dt infinitesimally.

127
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,000
And that's our basic expression.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,420
Now, I'm going to do a little bit more elaboration on it.

129
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,520
But up to here, what depended on the particular choice

130
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,800
of stock dynamics?

131
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,740
So the answer is almost nothing.

132
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,040
But the only thing that shows up, it depends on the form

133
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,540
that we began with up here.

134
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,770
It does not depend on the sigma S.

135
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,250
The sigma S does mean that when we get expressions like this

136
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,120
here, this would be sigma squared S squared over 2

137
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,620
in the Black-Scholes equation.

138
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,790
Here it's general.

139
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,530
It's b squared over 2.

140
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,020
What about the a term?

141
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,659
The a term goes away.

142
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,070
Nothing depends on it.

143
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,570
It's dropped out completely.

144
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,909
Well it's not completely dropped out.

145
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,419
In a sense, the a term is part of dS,

146
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,429
but we canceled the dS term.

147
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,010
So whatever relationship there is between the

148
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,200
a function in the stock, and the subsequent behavior

149
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,020
of the derivative, it's already been taken care of

150
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,930
or it's already been canceled out of the equation.

151
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,930
It no longer matters when we have a portfolio that

152
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,850
balances exactly the right amount

153
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,250
of the derivative security in the right amount

154
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,510
of the underlying.

155
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,570
So we still have a b, which we haven't specified.

156
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,460
So the only difference at this point,

157
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,280
from our Black-Scholes equation, is that instead of b squared,

158
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,430
we would have had sigma squared S squared.

159
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,160
And then we expanded out and we have the same thing

160
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,630
that we had before.

161
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:34,850
We simply write this as r times V minus delta S times dt.

162
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,980
And now we notice that on the left hand, right hand sides,

163
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,490
I have everything in dt.

164
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,730
Moving everything to the same side

165
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,070
or if you'd like, dividing by dt,

166
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:58,620
because there are no more stochastic differentials,

167
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:06,460
we can put in our dt times partial of V with respect to t

168
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,250
plus b squared over 2.

169
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:23,220
d2 of V squared plus r partial of V with respect to S--

170
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,960
should be rS--

171
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,190
minus rV.

172
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,480
And this whole thing is equal to zero.

173
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,970
And therefore the coefficient, the thing in the brackets,

174
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,530
has to be equal to zero.

175
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,430
The thing that is the coefficient of dt.

176
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,300
So that's it.

177
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,350
That's our generalization.

178
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,670
So given an Ito process, a general Ito

179
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,020
process up here, in terms of anything

180
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,200
with any coefficient a and any coefficient

181
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,980
b, we've got the Black-Scholes equation, with the only thing

182
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,890
that we need to do is to substitute

183
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,770
in the appropriate b.

184
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,470
So here's your chance to try it out.
