PROFESSOR: An asset follows the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,

1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,550
which is a continuous time, mean reverting process if it's

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,280
given by the expression, dS equals

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,360
lambda, which is a constant, times S

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,020
bar, another constant, nimus S dt plus sigma dB.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,250
This is in the continuous time analog of an AR1 process.

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,060
This is the standardized Brownian motion, sigma dB,

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,640
where sigma is a scale factor for the randomness.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,100
Over here, we see I've got mean reversion, where

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,350
if lambda's a positive constant, this

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,530
tells me that if S is below S bar, this is positive.

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,170
If this S is above S bar, this is negative.

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,160
So this gives me a mean reversion force,

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,470
and this gives me a random shock as time has evolved.

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,830
So, just given this description, which

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,200
is quite different from the log normal, geometric Brownian

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,830
motion that was part of the original Black-Scholes-Merton

17
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,110
derivation, this is a different process.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,340
What PDE is satisfied by derivatives of this asset?

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,500
Take a moment, and then we'll check together.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:25,830


21
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,720
What did you find?

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,738
Did you rederive using Ito's Lemma?

23
00:01:30,738 --> 00:01:32,780
We don't even need to work that hard, we can just

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,940
plug into our last result. We know

25
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,970
it looks exactly like the Black-Scholes equation,

26
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,550
with exactly one change.

27
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,790
We identify, in terms of our standard form,

28
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:53,180
if we want to write dS of the form a dt plus b dB.

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:59,150
That implies that we have a is equal to lambda, S bar

30
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,600
minus S, which doesn't appear in the differential equation

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,590
we want.

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,980
And we have b is equal to sigma.

33
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,900
In the Black-Scholes equation, it

34
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,140
would have been sigma times S.

35
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:19,320
So the equation we want is partial of V with respect

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:28,700
to t plus sigma squared over 2 second partial of V

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,550
with respect to S squared plus rS partial of V

38
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:40,490
with respect to S minus rV equals 0 and we're done.

39
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:47,870


40
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,640
That's it.

41
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,610
So the only difference between this and Black-Scholes

42
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,480
is that-- the coefficient function here in front

43
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,790
would have had an S squared in Black-Scholes.

44
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,710
Here, it only has a sigma.

45
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:06,200
The a function, which was mu S in the case of Black-Scholes.

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,090
And here, it's something linear and S.

47
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,710
It could have been cubic.

48
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,860
It could have been any polynomial function or a more

49
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,020
complicated function in S.

50
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,470
It wouldn't make any difference.

51
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,060
It wouldn't show up as part of the differential equation.

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,500
It might show up elsewhere.

53
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,210
And it certainly shows up if we want

54
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,370
to understand the dynamics of the underlying itself.

55
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,730
But if we want to know about the derivatives,

56
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,130
given the behavior of the underlying,

57
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,670
our expression is easy to derive.

58
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,030
And all we needed to do was, in our derivation,

59
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,460
once we canceled the risk, the only part that

60
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,300
retained an explicit memory of the Ito process,

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,630
was the Ito term, which had the coefficient B squared,

62
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,680
the coefficient of the randomness in the original we

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,719
defined process.

64
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,219
