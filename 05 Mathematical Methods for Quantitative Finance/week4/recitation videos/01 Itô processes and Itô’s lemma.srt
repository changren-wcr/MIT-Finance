00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
PROFESSOR: Let's take a look at Ito processes and Ito's lemma.

1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,630
Let's do a few examples.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,540
So an Ito process has two parts.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,930
It has a deterministic part and a random part.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,490
And of course, random part is the one

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,500
that we're particularly interested in.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,050
This is directly analogous to what we did when

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,340
we looked at discrete time.

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,910
If we think about our old friend the generalized random walk,

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,700
we had a term r, which represented

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,980
the change, the difference in variables,

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,350
in this case, logarithms and prices,

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,360
over a particular interval.

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,420
That's going to be one way you can think about dx.

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,030
The next term, mu, was just a constant.

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,630
It was something by which in every period r would increase.

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,000
The same kind of thing with the term adt.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,730
We think of it as being a deterministic term.

18
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,760
And in fact, if a were a constant mu,

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,060
and we were to integrate this over a time interval of length

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,280
1, we would see that we'd get the same result.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,140
We would just get a constant.

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,990
And then the last term has two parts, a little b and a big B.

23
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:09,230
The big dB plays the role of our standardized random variable

24
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,520
Z. That is, it has zero mean instead of unit variance.

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,460
Because it's an infinitesimal, it has the next best thing.

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,650
It has variance dt.

27
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,280
And the coefficient function in front of it, little b,

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,200
plays the same role as sigma.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,050
The difference is that our coefficient functions a and b,

30
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,860
might just be that.

31
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,220
They might be functions.

32
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:37,340
So a and b can be functions of t and of x itself, all right?

33
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:47,910
So we do have that a can be a function in general of t and x.

34
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,350
And b could be a function of t and x as well.

35
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,020
But certainly, the special cases where little a and little b

36
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,030
are constant, are going to be interesting.

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,340
Now the question that we ask in applying

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,660
Ito's lemma is, suppose I'm given an Ito process dx,

39
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,060
and I have some function of x.

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,470
What's its differential?

41
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,889
If it were an ordinary function, an ordinary deterministic

42
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,490
function, then the answer would be given by the chain rule.

43
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,200
And if you don't remember the chain rule,

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,802
now would be an excellent time to go brush up

45
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:21,510
because we're going to be using it a lot.

46
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,880
And what I want you to focus on are the differences

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,760
between the ordinary chain rule and the Ito rule.

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,230
So the first two terms tell us for a function of t and x

49
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,790
how differentials behave.

50
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,910
They depend on the evolution with respect

51
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,160
to time, the partial derivative with respect

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,570
to time times dt plus the partial with respect to x times

53
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,230
dx.

54
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,410
And this piece over here is genuinely new.

55
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,813
And that's going to be the source

56
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:49,230
of a lot of the interesting things

57
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,320
that we'll see when we look at continuous time finance.

58
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,300
Our strategy is going to be the same

59
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,480
though, that we saw in looking at time series models,

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,650
namely, to build complex models and interesting phenomenon

61
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,620
relationships out of very simple building blocks.

62
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,100
So our simple building block here, is going to be dB.

63
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,670
That's it.

64
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,070
So we want to know the properties of dB,

65
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,350
either in differential or integral form.

66
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,620
And we're going to be combining those in different ways

67
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,620
and solving some interesting financial problems.

68
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,880
So the idea is that economic variables of interest,

69
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,580
like a stock price, like an interest rate,

70
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,780
like a yield or a wide variety of other variables,

71
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,350
will be described by stochastic processes that can be built out

72
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,190
of Brownian motion, who is in infinitesimal form, our dB.

73
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,490
Then we're going to apply our usual tools, which we linearity

74
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,820
expectations plus a new tool, Ito's lemma,

75
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,450
for evaluating functions for looking at changes in variable

76
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,845
to get interesting results.

77
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:56,490


78
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,800
Now in general, our goal is going

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:07,510
to be to apply Ito's lemma to functions of the form F of t

80
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,280
and x, and--

81
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,190
sorry, let's scrawl that up slightly.

82
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,680
So we're going to apply Ito's lemma

83
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,320
to things that are of the form function of t

84
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,730
and a function of x.

85
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,330
In the classic case, and one will be thinking most about--

86
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,330
it's going to be the case of pricing derivative securities.

87
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,550
So a derivative security is a security

88
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,670
whose value depends on, is derived from,

89
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,390
the value of something else.

90
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,840
So the classic example would be a stock option,

91
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,930
where x would be the stock price or possibly

92
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,340
the logarithm of the stock price,

93
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,160
but x is related to the value of the underlying,

94
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,430
t is ordinary time, and F is the value

95
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,020
of the derivative security.

96
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,600
And what Ito's lemma tells us is,

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,730
how changes in the value of the underlying

98
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,970
translate into changes in the value

99
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,600
of the derivative security.

100
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,030
We'll look at this as we do often

101
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,890
in differential equations, by taking

102
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,380
what happened that infinitesimal time,

103
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,260
and then solving for what happens in the general case

104
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,520
as we apply boundary conditions.

105
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,540
So, what I'd like to do now is give a few examples,

106
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,570
where we can just use some of the basic calculus

107
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,920
and get used to computing Ito differentials.

108
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,420
And there are a few things I'd like you to pay attention to.

109
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,670
The first one is to look at the structure.

110
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,840
So the basic structure of an Ito process

111
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,290
is that, in an Ito process, it's always

112
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,390
of the form for an Ito process that we have--

113
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,010
an Ito process is something times dt

114
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,590
plus something else times dB.

115
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,120
And we might need to massage things

116
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,640
or move some terms around, or regroup or rewrite things.

117
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,110
But if we can do that, then we'll be all set.

118
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,070
That means that it's an Ito process.

119
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,770
And the reason that Ito processes

120
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,570
are interesting as a class is that, Ito's lemma tells us

121
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,610
that the differential of an Ito process

122
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,218
is itself an Ito process.

123
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:04,760
So that's what's going to be helpful.

124
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,420
So what we want to do is, we want to look at the structure

125
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,420
that we have, in terms of the different differentials.

126
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,990
We want to keep in mind which pieces are stochastic

127
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,420
and which pieces are deterministic,

128
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,780
which pieces are functions of time only,

129
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,510
so they can evolve in time but in a non-random way.

130
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,307
We want to see which things depend on what.

131
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:27,890
Are there functions that are constant?

132
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,000
Do they depend on t?

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,140
Do they depend on B?

134
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,910
Do they depend on both?

135
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,610
If I'm computing differentials, notice

136
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,760
that in the formula for dF, that I have b, appears here,

137
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,050
but a doesn't appear at all.

138
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,410
So does that mean the dF is independent of a?

139
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,140
Well certainly not independent of b.

140
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,870
So when I've written little a and little b, remember,

141
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,580
those are just the coefficients of these things.

142
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,230
So we'll use different variables,

143
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,390
I'll take different forms.

144
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,130
I might even re-use letters a and b from time to time.

145
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,400
But in this formula, in Ito's formula,

146
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,860
this b squared means the coefficient

147
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,068
of whatever is in the defining formula for dx,

148
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:09,110
which is the variable with respect to which we're

149
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,980
differentiating.

150
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,940
So does this mean that dF is independent of a?

151
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,010
Well, it looks like it in this form,

152
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,840
but not really, because remember,

153
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,140
this expression, which is a standard form Ito's lemma,

154
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,145
contains a dx.

155
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:25,477
So then this term is a dt, this term is a dt.

156
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:26,685
We could group them together.

157
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:29,420
The reason it's often written like this is so that we can

158
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,080
say, chain rule plus new guy.

159
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,110
But in addition to that, we do have dx,

160
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,150
which I could substitute in.

161
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,400
It has a dt and a dB.

162
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,590
And that of course, contains a.

163
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,830
So even though the a isn't explicitly visible,

164
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,330
we might think of it as being there.

165
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,980
And you'll want to keep an eye on these

166
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,810
because they'll show up in interesting ways

167
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,360
in different applications, whether things are explicitly

168
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,670
visible or implicit in the language,

169
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,320
or whether they're gone entirely.
