1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,550
PROFESSOR: Now here's an exercise.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,820
Let F be the function of t and B,

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,130
where B is a standard Brownian motion,

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,020
be e to the minus rt times the sine of theta B.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,230
So r and theta are both constants.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,430
And what we'd like to do are two things.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,220
First, find the differential dF using Ito's lemma.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,010
Second, looking at the result that you have, consider

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,200
the parameter values, r and theta,

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,820
and ask if there are choices of r and theta in terms of which,

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,950
dF becomes particularly simple, where

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,890
it becomes only, either a function of dt

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,960
or a function of dB.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,700
So pause the video.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,555
Take a few minutes to work on it.

16
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:48,555
And then we'll go through the solution together.

17
00:00:48,555 --> 00:01:06,970


18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,010
Now we'll use the simplified form of Ito's lemma

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,900
because we have it in terms of B,

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,440
not in a more complicated generalized Ito process.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,100
So let's take a look.

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,070
We have that dx is just dB.

23
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,650
So in our version of Ito's lemma,

24
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,330
where we take differentials with respect

25
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,640
to x, we can just replace them by B.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,010
And where we have the Ito term with little b squared--

27
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,950
remember that in our usual notation, this is a equals 0

28
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,440
and little b equals 1.

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,330
So that simplifies.

30
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,980
The next thing we do is we compute

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,780
the partial derivatives, the three partial derivatives that

32
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,210
show up in Ito's formula, of F. So we need partial

33
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,610
of F with respect to time.

34
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,440
That's easy.

35
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:12,980
That's e to the minus rt times minus r times sine of theta B.

36
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,860
So we can rewrite that as, minus r times F itself,

37
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,550
if we'd like to.

38
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,460
We can use either of those forms.

39
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,240
We have the second partial derivative

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,250
in the first partial derivative with respect

41
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,990
to B. So partial of F with respect to B

42
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:39,950
is just equal to theta times e to the minus rt

43
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,280
times cosine of theta B.

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,490
And the second partial derivative

45
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:53,150
is going to be second partial of F with respect to B squared

46
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:59,240
is going to be minus theta squared e to the minus rt

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,070
times sine of theta B. And that is the same thing

48
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:11,570
as minus theta squared times F. Minus theta

49
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,810
squared times F because the e to the minus rt

50
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,280
just comes along for the ride.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,260


52
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,010
So let's just substitute with our results.

53
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:30,060
So we have that dF is the partial of F with respect

54
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,070
to t times to dt.

55
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:38,000
That's going to give us a minus re

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,070
to the minus rt sine theta B, all times

57
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:51,000
dt plus first partial with respect to B times dB.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,370
That's going to give us theta e the minus rt cosine theta B

59
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,730
times dB plus the Ito term, which

60
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,050
is going to be 1/2 second partial with respect to b

61
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,260
squared of F times dt.

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,060
So that's going to give us minus theta squared

63
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:26,070
e to the minus rt divided by 2 times sine theta B dt.

64
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,710
If we group the terms together we see,

65
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,900
first of all, that everything--

66
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,410
the common e to the minus rt out in front.

67
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,370
That's good to keep in mind.

68
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,660
And then the first term we're going

69
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:49,860
to have is going to be give us a minus r

70
00:04:49,860 --> 00:05:05,165
plus theta squared over 2 times sine theta B dt.

71
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:10,190


72
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,690
Let's see.

73
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:17,820
We wanted to have a big thing for our exponential outside

74
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,900
of everything.

75
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,420
And we've got our second term.

76
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,160
It's going to be the dB term.

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:46,700
It's going to be plus theta e to the minus rt cosine theta B dB.

78
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,880
And there we go.

79
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,185
So this expression gives us our result or dF.

80
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,720


81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,260
So that's our expression.

82
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,050
So it's an Ito process because it's

83
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,130
something times dt plus something times dB, OK?

84
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,160
So if we want to write down these coefficient functions,

85
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,320
we could say that we have a F is going to be minus

86
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:20,940
e to the minus rt times r plus theta squared over 2 sine theta

87
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,620
B. And that's definitely a function of t and B.

88
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,600
And B is going to be e to the minus rt times theta

89
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,420
cosine of theta B. And that's definitely

90
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,970
a function of time and B. Sorry, it's behind my head.

91
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,590
So let's take a look at the expression

92
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,110
and see if we can answer the second question,

93
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,500
are there values of r and theta, in which this

94
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,520
would simplify to only be a function of dt or dB?

95
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,480
Well it can't possibly be a function only of dB.

96
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,330
Remember, the dB is our source of randomness.

97
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,350
And we can't make the randomness go away just by changing

98
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,190
variables in a simple way.

99
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,340
We're not going to turn something

100
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,610
that was random into something that's non-random that easily.

101
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,620
We'll see some other ways to do that.

102
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,130
But what about the first term?

103
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,360
Well the first term is e to the minus rt,

104
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,460
but now notice the coefficient function.

105
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,850
It involves r plus theta squared over 2.

106
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,680
So if I chose r to be minus theta squared over 2,

107
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,820
then the first term would vanish.

108
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,570
Usually, when we have r in our expressions,

109
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,890
we think of r as being the risk-free interest rate.

110
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,740
And normally the risk-free interest rate

111
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,880
needs to be a positive number.

112
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,410
But keep in mind that, there certainly

113
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,628
are negative interest rates that actually do now

114
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:50,670
happen in the real world, even though we normally

115
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,200
would think of r as being typically positive.

116
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,190
And here in this example, this is not

117
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,660
meant to be a financial example.

118
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,050
These are just arbitrary parameter choices.

119
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,330
So we certainly could pick a special value

120
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,750
of r, in terms of which the coefficient function of t

121
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,470
would vanish.

122
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,790
And then we'd be left with just the term in dB.

123
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,650
So, a simple case where we took a basic function,

124
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:22,920
not additive but multiplicative, a function of r times--

125
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,340
excuse me, a function of time, times a function of B,

126
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,900
applied Ito's lemma, turn the crank and we get our answer.

127
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,560
That's all there is to it.
