1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,490
PROFESSOR: Suppose x is a stochastic process

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,160
that's defined by the expression dx

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,090
over x equals mu dt plus sigma dB,

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,330
where mu and sigma are both constants,

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,340
and we'd like to find a function F

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,480
in terms of which dF is an Ito process

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,170
with constant coefficients.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,420
So take a moment to think about it.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,540
Think about how you'd approach it,

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,070
if you can set it up, and then let's take a look at it

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,570
together.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:39,650


13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,480
I'd like to do this systematically.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,720
So you might have gotten it by inspection

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,080
or had a clever guess, or maybe you've seen it before.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,540
But let's see how we can work through this systematically.

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,950
What we'd like to do is use the different ways

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,430
that we can write dF to solve systematically

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,580
for such a function.

20
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,030
And we're going to do it by deriving some equations that F

21
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,650
has to satisfy in order that the coefficients aF and BF would

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,710
be constant.

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,440
So two things we want to do-- first of all,

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,360
let's just identify our-- the parts of our function,

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,300
our function dx, by writing dx is

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:30,230
equal to mu x times dt plus sigma x time dB.

27
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,050
So in our usual notation for an Ito process,

28
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,100
we have a is the function mu x.

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,350
B is the function sigma x.

30
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,940
So that all just comes from here.

31
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,020
That's direct.

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,470
Now, let's apply Ito to dF using the expressions

33
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,520
that we have worked out earlier.

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,310
So let's say that dF is equal to something times dt.

35
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,875
Well, what's the coefficient of dt?

36
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:02,160


37
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,370
We have the partial of F with respect

38
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:11,510
to t plus we have the Ito term, B squared over 2,

39
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,520
which, in our case, is sigma x squared over 2 times

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,890
the second partial of F dx squared plus we have a term

41
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,110
a dF dx.

42
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:32,690
So this is going to be mu x times partial of F

43
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,640
with respect to x.

44
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:44,970
And this whole thing times dt plus another term,

45
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,390
which is going to be a little bit simpler--

46
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,920
this is going to be sigma x, which

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:59,000
is little b, partial of F with respect to x, times dB.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,060
So this is the form of Ito's lemma

49
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,610
where we combine terms into something times

50
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,080
dt for something times dB rather than something times dt

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,060
plus something times dx.

52
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,100
So in this term, what we'd like is

53
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,130
we'd like the things in these brackets.

54
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,340
Let me make these red brackets now.

55
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,570
This should be a constant, and so should this.

56
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,710
Now, the second one has only one term.

57
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,200
The first one has three.

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,300
So why don't we work in the easy one first?

59
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,330
So we need a function F so that this expression here

60
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,035
is a constant.

61
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:41,370


62
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:58,300
That is, we need F t and x such that sigma

63
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:04,725
x partial of F with respect to x is a constant.

64
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:07,950


65
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,100
Well, I can easily move the-- we can divide both sides

66
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,720
of this equation by sigma.

67
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,269
Divide that by sigma over here.

68
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,180
And in the left, we'll do division by erasure.

69
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,339
So I have this expression.

70
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,810
That's just another constant.

71
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,710
The sigma is a nonzero constant.

72
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,070
So this says, what is the function

73
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:32,290
such that x-- partial of F with respect to x is a constant?

74
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,810
Well, if F were a function of x only, that would be easy.

75
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:51,890
So suppose if t and x is just F of x.

76
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:59,710
Then we would have x partial of F with respect

77
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,870
to x is some constant.

78
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,490
Let's call it c.

79
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,960
It's our old constant, which was unspecified, divided by sigma.

80
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,660
In this equation, we can integrate.

81
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:18,640
This just says that dF is equal to c

82
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:30,580
dx over x, which tells us that F is equal to c times log x.

83
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,860
So let's check this expression and see

84
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,120
that it satisfies at least giving a constant coefficient

85
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,950
of our second term.

86
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:45,980
We notice that if we come back up over here,

87
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:53,340
we have x partial of F with respect to x, in this case,

88
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,260
is going to be x times d over x.

89
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,900
And it's equal to c, which is, indeed, a constant.

90
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,680
And that's the term that went here.

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,450
So, in fact, we would find that this

92
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:13,960
would have coefficient sigma c, where c

93
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,270
is our constant of integration.

94
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,870
What about our term above?

95
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,360
Well, let's continue with this form of x.

96
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,480
So if F of x-- let me move out of the way--

97
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,340
is the expression that we had here.

98
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,340


99
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,130
And, in fact-- so it's something times the logarithm of x.

100
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,800
The first partial derivative here is going to vanish.

101
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,290
The second partial derivative is going

102
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,120
to give minus c over x squared.

103
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,210
The x squared will cancel this x squared.

104
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,680
And this will be a constant.

105
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,540
There won't be any more x's.

106
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,710
And over here, similarly, partial of F with respect to x

107
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,380
gives me c over x.

108
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,160
And the x multiplies this x.

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,390
And those cancel out.

110
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,890
And I'm left with a constant.

111
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,230
So what we find is--

112
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:22,850


113
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:34,630
so we find that the specific choice F of x

114
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:45,370
equals c log x gives dF.

115
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,400
It's going to be equal to c sigma

116
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,900
squared over 2 with a minus sign in front

117
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,030
from the second derivative term plus c

118
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:12,805
mu, all times dt plus c sigma dB.

119
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:16,510


120
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,100
And now let's let c equals 1.

121
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,210
It's a little bit simpler.

122
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,950
Since these are constants, anyways,

123
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,870
we'll come back to our old friend.

124
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,390
So this is equal to--

125
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:34,350
let's just write this as C in front times u minus sigma

126
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:41,235
squared over 2 dt plus sigma dB.

127
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:44,320


128
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,700
And this is the differential of F.

129
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,120
So in the lecture, I wrote down the choice

130
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,140
of a function that was the logarithm of a stock price.

131
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,900
And we derived this equation as a result--

132
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,470
that we said that this equation for the logarithm of F was,

133
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,380
in fact, integrable because both the left-hand sides--

134
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,630
left- and right-hand sides were differentials.

135
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,790
Now we see that we come to the same expression

136
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,442
if we ask a different question.

137
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:17,150
That's how we got it to be differentiable

138
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,270
in the first place.

139
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,140
If we said, what functions are there

140
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,350
such that the expressions we get are going

141
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,810
to be integrable with constant coefficients,

142
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,200
the answer to that equation is the function

143
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,500
we need is the logarithm.

144
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,000
