PROFESSOR: Here's our first exercise.

1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,770
Suppose I have a function, which is just a function of t and B

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,000
explicitly.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,880
And it's t cubed plus B cubed.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,430
Can you find dF?

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,470
So please pause the video, take a minute

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,760
to see what you can do.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,830
And then come back if you need a hint.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,860
And then I'll give you another chance

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,200
to solve the problem, with or without the hint.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:35,160


11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,580
OK, just a hint in case you're stuck on things

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,330
because this looks a little bit different,

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,950
but it's actually a trivial special case.

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,450
We wrote down Ito's lemma in terms of x,

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,280
but this is just a special case.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,260
So we have here--

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,240


18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:01,560
this is really just a special case, where dx is equal to dB.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,800
And that means, in terms of our general expression,

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,890
if I write this as adt plus bdB, that

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:18,690
implies that a is equal to 0 and little b is equal to 1.

22
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,230
So I find it sometimes helpful to write the assumptions out

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,370
explicitly.

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,640
And that means that we can write Ito's lemma in this form.

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,580
We can say that Ito's lemma is dF, is going to be partial of F

26
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,800
with respect to t dt plus partial of F--

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,820
now normally I would have written with partial of F

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,930
with respect to x.

29
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,550
But in this case, because d--

30
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,410
sorry-- dx and dB are the same thing,

31
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,440
we can write this just in terms of dB.

32
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,510
So let's write this as partial dB plus the Ito term, which

33
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,100
is normally little b squared.

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,860
But again, because we have that b is equal to 1,

35
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,810
we can simplify this.

36
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:18,530
And we can write this as 1/2 second partial of F

37
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,660
with respect to B squared times dt.

38
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,420
And now let's combine the first and last terms to get us

39
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,620
something that we can use easily.

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,250
So this is going to be partial of F

41
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:37,970
with respect to t plus 1/2 second partial of F

42
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,830
with respect to B squared.

43
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,390
It doesn't matter whether you do this

44
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,760
before or after, of course, because addition

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,020
is commutative.

46
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:55,890
This is times dt plus partial of F with respect to B dB.

47
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,130
So take a moment now, and see if you

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,670
can compute dF for our function F, which

49
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,070
is t cubed plus B cubed.

50
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:22,630


51
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,810
OK, let's take a look.

52
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,390


53
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:35,470
We have that F is t cubed, plus B cubed.

54
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,640
So let's just compute the partial derivatives.

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,130
Partial of F with respect to t is 3t squared.

56
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:52,570
Partial of F with respect to B is 3B squared.

57
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:58,360
In the second partial derivative of F with respect to B

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,350
squared is going to be 6B.

59
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,340
So let's take those results, plug them into our formulas.

60
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,080
And we're going to have here-- this

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,900
is going to be 3t squared plus 1/2

62
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,580
of the second partial derivative.

63
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,519
That's going to be 6B divided by 2.

64
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:30,180
That's going to give us plus 3B, all times dt,

65
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,820
plus our last term just has a single partial, partial of F

66
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:48,690
with respect to B, which is 3B squared times dB.

67
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,820
So that's our answer.

68
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,560
So we have a big 3 out in front, and we

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,360
could write this as 3 times t squared

70
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:07,850
plus B dt plus B squared dB.

71
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,530
Question?

72
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,055
Is this an Ito process?

73
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:12,555
Answer.

74
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:15,180


75
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,930
What do you think?

76
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,090
If it is an Ito process, write down little a and little b.

77
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,270
If it's not an Ito process, why not?

78
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,550
Well it is an Ito process because we have

79
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,400
something dt plus something dB.

80
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,870
And in this case, let me call it a--

81
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,770
maybe we'll call it a sub F. It's

82
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,680
going to be 3t squared plus 3B.

83
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,030
So notice that's of the form function of t and B.

84
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:59,760
And similarly, b F is going to be 3B squared.

85
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,640
So that's our answer for this exercise.
