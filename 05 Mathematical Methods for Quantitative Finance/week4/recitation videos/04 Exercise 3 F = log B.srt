PROFESSOR: Exercise-- let F be the natural logarithm of B.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Find dF by using Ito's lemma.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,472
Pause the video, take a moment to do it on your own,

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:14,180
then come back, and we'll do it together.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:24,220


6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,510
This case is especially simple.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,510
So we have that dX is dB.

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,170
So we only need to worry about taking partial derivatives

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,390
with respect to B. There's no dt term in our underlying Ito

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,260
process.

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,090
And F depends on B only, not on time.

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,320
So we have that the partial of F with respect to time

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,240
is equal to 0.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,330
The first partial of F with respect to B is 1 over B.

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,130
And the second partial derivative

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:07,770
of F with respect to B squared is minus 1 over B squared.

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,250
So let's compute dF.

18
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:18,750
Well, dF is partial of F with respect to t dt.

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,160
That doesn't exist.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,260
Then, we're going to have partial of F

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,470
with respect to B times dB.

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,870
Plus, we have the Ito term, which,

23
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,980
because we've got this specially simple form for our Ito

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:38,500
process, is going to involve just 1/2 times

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,330
the second partial derivative minus 1 over B squared

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,920
times dt.

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,450
So we're done.

28
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:57,500
This is dB over B minus 1 over 2B squared dt.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,000
