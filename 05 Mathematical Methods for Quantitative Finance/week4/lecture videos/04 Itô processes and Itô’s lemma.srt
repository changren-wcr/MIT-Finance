1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,320
PROFESSOR: An Ito process is like a generalized random walk,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,430
and Ito's lemma will give us a formula for doing calculus

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,050
with Ito processes.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,660
So an Ito process is defined to be a differential that's

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,790
a linear combination of dB, our Gaussian Brownian

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,860
random variable, plus possibly times a scale factor little b,

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,790
plus some deterministic part I'll call a dt.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,470
If the second term were absent, this

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,770
would just be an ordinary differential,

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,280
and we could look about ordinary ways of integrating it.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,620
But dB is going to be random, and that's going

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,370
to give us something different.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,540
In particular, because the Brownian path

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,190
itself is not differentiable, X won't be differentiable,

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,700
and we can't take derivatives in the usual way.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:00,300
If we had a function of X and t where X were a normal variable,

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,700
the usual chain rule would say that we compute

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,790
the differential of our function F of t and X

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,280
as partial of F with respect to t times

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,910
dt plus partial with respect to X dX,

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,030
and that would be it for our ordinary chain rule.

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,280
But we're going to see that there's an extra term that

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,820
gets added when we're dealing with Ito processes,

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,720
and that comes about because we can't use this rule because we

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,060
can't differentiate directly for Brownian paths.

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,150
So the idea behind the proof is we're

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,740
going to try to rewrite our familiar ideas from calculus

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,800
in a way that makes sense probabilistically.

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,570
Let me tell you up front that, number one,

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,070
I'm going to sketch out the proof

31
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,630
and it's not going to be rigorous.

32
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,970
This is going to be a somewhat heuristic proof.

33
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,910
And number two, the results actually

34
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,270
matter more than the proof.

35
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,520
So I'll be upfront about this.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,490
I want you to see where it comes from.

37
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,060
I'd like you to see where the probability arises and the Ito

38
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,390
term in the modified chain rule, but this

39
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,520
is an area where even if you don't remember

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,000
how to derive it, if you start with Ito's lemma, the rule

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,760
that we're going to have, you can apply it successfully

42
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,380
without really needing to come back to the derivation.

43
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,140
So with a little bit of chagrin, I will admit that.

44
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,590
But I hope it gives you confidence that you can--

45
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,170
if you don't follow every detail in what we're doing,

46
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,550
it's not going to make any difference for the result.

47
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,460
So the idea is we'd like to capture the expression up here

48
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,960
in a case where we're dealing with probabilities.

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,380
So you can think of this as we construct

50
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,490
the object on the right by taking finite changes

51
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,340
dx, where I've written it here as delta x.

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,840
I construct this ratio F of x plus delta

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,380
x minus F of x over delta x, and then I take a limit.

54
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,440
And that defines the object that's on the left-hand side

55
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,360
that we typically call the derivative of F,

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,200
or in this case, F prime.

57
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,660
So what I'd like to do is I'd like

58
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,540
to say in probability, because the result

59
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,270
on the right-hand side is going to be different every time I

60
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,910
compute it, because x is a random variable,

61
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,970
F is going to be random.

62
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,370
I'm not going to get a concrete, definite result for F.

63
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,650
The sense in which I'm going to define it

64
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,590
is to say that I have found a sensible definition for F prime

65
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,280
if the probability that this function deviates

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,270
from the right-hand side goes to 0 as delta x goes to 0.

67
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,060
So I can write this in the following two ways.

68
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,810
I can write it either as saying that the probability

69
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,750
of a deviation-- so I've written this

70
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,620
as being the difference between the left and right-hand sides

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,700
above me, quantity squared, so that it's always

72
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,140
a positive quantity.

73
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,200
The probability that that's greater than 0

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,480
goes to 0 as delta x goes to 0.

75
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,610
In other words, they're equal.

76
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,550
So if a construct, F prime of x, satisfies this,

77
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,440
I would say I've found the derivatives.

78
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,480
You notice that's the same flavor,

79
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,480
same result in the non-probabilistic case

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,280
as the traditional formula.

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,500
I can also state it in terms of expectations.

82
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,390
I can say that the expectation that the squared difference

83
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,595
will be non-zero goes to 0.

84
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:21,720
So what are we going to do?

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,790
Well, we're going to start by writing things out,

86
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,600
a differential for a Taylor series,

87
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,820
including lots of higher-order terms,

88
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,150
and then we're going to only keep

89
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,160
terms that are of order dt.

90
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,400
Anything that vanishes as dt or delta t

91
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,480
goes to 0 faster than dt, we're going to toss out.

92
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,880
But what we'll need to do is keep a couple extra terms

93
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,640
because a few things that we might have thought

94
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,790
would vanish actually, it turns out, stick around.

95
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,300
So we're going to start with our definition of our Ito process

96
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,720
and just plug it in.

97
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,500
So I start by writing out an ordinary Taylor expansion

98
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,298
for a differential in terms of all

99
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,590
these higher-order derivatives.

100
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,007
There will be cross terms, partial

101
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:03,910
of F with respect to X and t, dX/dt, term in dt squared,

102
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,695
terms in dX cubed, dX squared, dt, and so on.

103
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:09,445
And what I'm going to do for each of these

104
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:13,660
is I can substitute in my expression here for dX, here

105
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,880
for dX squared, and so on.

106
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,560
And then what I'd like to do is think

107
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,770
about taking expectations of the left side

108
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,870
and the right-hand side and see which

109
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,480
terms survive as we think of dt as being an infinitesimal.

110
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,280
So to do that, we want to look at our basic building block.

111
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,930
Remember that dB is a Gaussian random variable.

112
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,880
So it has mean 0, it has no skewness for its third moment,

113
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,200
its square.

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,860
We know its variance is dt, the length of the time interval,

115
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,200
which is infinitesimal.

116
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,900
And if we want the fourth power, we

117
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,350
get-- whereas a normal random variable, the fourth moment is

118
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,900
equal to 3, that's the reason we subtract off

119
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,470
3 for our excess kurtosis, in the case of infinitesimals,

120
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,390
when you put it in the dt's, I get the result

121
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,780
for the fourth power.

122
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,750
This is the same as the usual 3 times

123
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,720
dt squared, which we get just on dimensional grounds.

124
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,140
So if I take those building blocks for dB

125
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,270
and I apply them to Ito processes

126
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,900
and ask about expectation and mean and variance and so on,

127
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,830
do the usual thing.

128
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,360
I apply linearity.

129
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,980
So dX is just a dt plus b dB.

130
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,730
Apply linearity, so it's the expectation of a sum

131
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,470
is the sum of the expectations.

132
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,210
a dt is deterministic.

133
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,690
It's like a constant.

134
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,930
So I get a dt out here.

135
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,080
The mean of dB is 0, so all I get

136
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,540
for the mean of my Ito process is

137
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,700
a dt, which is deterministic.

138
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,340
What about the square?

139
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,860
Well, for the square, I put in the square,

140
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,140
take the second power, expand it out, do the exponentials using

141
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,450
the formulas on the top of the screen,

142
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,110
and I get a squared dt plus b squared dt.

143
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,000
When I compute the variance, remembering

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,460
that the variance is always the expectation

145
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,070
of the square minus the square of the expectation,

146
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,430
I find that the variance of dt is just little b squared dt,

147
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,120
and so on.

148
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,080
And I can compute higher moments as well.

149
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,650


150
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,750
So let's go back to our formula for dF,

151
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,140
and remember that we're going to be interested in terms

152
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,030
that are of order dt.

153
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,130
The key thing to keep in mind that's

154
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,910
going to drive our results is that because the expectation

155
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,890
of dB squared is dt and the variance

156
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,920
or the expectation of dX squared has a dt in it

157
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,360
for the variance, that we can think of dB as being

158
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,580
like a square root of dt.

159
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,240
And remember, as dt goes to 0, the square root of dt

160
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,178
is going to be bigger than dt.

161
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,720
But let's just put in the terms, we'll group things together,

162
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,990
and then we'll take the limit and see what vanishes.

163
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,465
So first I've got my expression for dF.

164
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,980


165
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,160
Next we're going to substitute in for dX, for dX squared,

166
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,180
and so on, where we're thinking about expectations.

167
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,870
And the higher-order terms are going to be non-stochastic.

168
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,090
We can group things together, where I can now

169
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,730
group together coefficients of dt.

170
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:34,890
Notice that I have a dt over here, a dt here, and a dt here.

171
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,590
Let me take the first and last terms and group

172
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,424
them together here, and I'll take the middle term,

173
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:42,549
and let's just keep it in this form for the moment,

174
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:46,320
bring it down here, partial of F with respect to X times dX.

175
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,140
Alternatively, instead of writing things

176
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,710
as a function of dt and dX, I can write them

177
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,130
as a function of dt and dB simply

178
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,930
by using the definition of dX.

179
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,450
So either way, in either this form or in the bottom form,

180
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,990
I have an expression for dF that I can work with.

181
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,770
So either of these two forms, depending on our applications,

182
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,000
will be useful.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,580
The point about looking at the last one

184
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,870
is look at its structure.

185
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:22,570
You notice that it's of the form something times dt

186
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,360
plus something else times dB.

187
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,280
That's just an Ito process.

188
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,010
So the differential of F when F is a function of an Ito process

189
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,610
is also an Ito process, and that's why these are useful,

190
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,130
because they're closed when we take differentials.

191
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,890
We get more Ito processes.

192
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,050
Here's the heuristic.

193
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,090
It's the easy way to keep track of things

194
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,490
without doing a lot of Taylor expansions.

195
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,100
If every time you see a dB squared,

196
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,460
you think of it as being a dt and every time you

197
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,370
see a dX squared, you think of it-- remember,

198
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,120
this is the pure, standardized random variable.

199
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,460
This is with a scale factor in it.

200
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,130
If every time you see a dX squared, you replace it

201
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,160
by little b squared dt, you'll basically

202
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,910
get the right answers.

203
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,310
So the differential that we have has one extra term

204
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,800
beyond the usual chain rule, OK?

205
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,410
So this is our result from the previous page.

206
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,900
When we take a look at this expression here,

207
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,120
we see that this term dt--

208
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,600
this term-- get my pointer working.

209
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,530
This term dt and this term dX are the usual chain rule,

210
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,720
but this one here is something new.

211
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,970
So writing it in standard form, we have Ito's lemma in the box,

212
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,060
and I'll circle it again in red.

213
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,300
So this is worth getting to know very, very well.

214
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,970
It says that the differential of a function of X,

215
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,120
where X is an Ito process, is partial of F with respect

216
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,930
to t dt, plus partial of F with respect to X dX

217
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:05,120
plus a new term that involves the second partial derivative

218
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,760
with respect to X squared, but it's multiplied by dt.

219
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,400
So we've seen that the differential

220
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,600
of a function of an Ito process is itself an Ito process.

221
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
And this formula is Ito's lemma.
