1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,810
PROFESSOR: Let's look at a few examples of Ito processes.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,340
Our first example is going to be a Brownian motion with drift.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,100
Could this be a possible model for stock prices?

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,030
Let's take a look.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,200
We'll define dS to be mu dt plus sigma dB,

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,240
where mu and sigma are both constants.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,190
This is easy to integrate.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,770
So suppose we start with this expression,

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:29,010
and now, let's just integrate each term, keeping in mind

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,229
that mu and sigma are constant.

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,140
So this will be from t equals 0 to big T.

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,820
And if we integrate on the left-hand side,

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,830
we just get St minus S at time 0 is equal to mu times

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:52,560
T plus sigma times BT, or, to be precise,

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,220
if we might have had some non-zero constant,

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,850
we could have this here.

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,920
So that's-- we've integrated an Ito process, and there we go.

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,440
We see that it has a linear growth with time

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,460
from the first term, and the second term

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,460
represents-- this term here represents a random variable,

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,340
so that the final destination of ST is unknown,

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,490
but BT, as we know, is drawn-- or this difference

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,210
is drawn from a Gaussian distribution.

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:29,200


25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,300
Now, this model has been considered

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,530
and generally rejected for purposes of stock prices.

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,620
It was the first model considered by Bachelier in 1900

28
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,780
for a theory for option pricing.

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,120
But the biggest complaint about it,

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,460
generally, is that it allows prices

31
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,100
to go negative with positive probability, something

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,820
that stocks can't do since stocks have limited liability.

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,510
So this is generally the preferred model.

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,330
And this geometric Brownian motion,

35
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,260
this continuous-time version of our log-normal process,

36
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,342
is the standard model for stock prices.

37
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:07,550
That doesn't mean it's right.

38
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,175
It means that it's the reference model.

39
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:11,420
Whether it's right or not, how well it works,

40
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,025
remains to be seen by looking at data

41
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:14,845
and by looking at applications.

42
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,220
But let's take a look at this now

43
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,500
as an application of Ito's lemma.

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,290
So we begin with this form, where

45
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,290
this looks similar to what we had before, but notice

46
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,060
I've multiplied through--

47
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,780
on the right-hand side, each of these terms has an extra S.

48
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,920
So my coefficient function a, little a and little b,

49
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,450
is mu S over here and sigma S over here.

50
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,900
So let's take a look at this as an application of Ito's lemma.

51
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,730
So here's our expression where I've

52
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,680
divided through by S. In this form,

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,020
we can see that what's a--

54
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,480


55
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,080
Brownian motion generalized is the quantity dS over S.

56
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,550
But notice we can't integrate that immediately because it's

57
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,410
not an exact differential.

58
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,350
It's a differential divided by S. If it were d of something,

59
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,930
then we'd be done, and that's our goal.

60
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:25,510
So I got this by taking dS is mu S dt plus sigma S

61
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,850
dB, which is of the form, of course,

62
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:42,830
a dt plus sigma, excuse me, plus b dB.

63
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:56,900
So we have that a, in this case, is mu S and b is sigma S.

64
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,880
And now we'd like to apply Ito's lemma.

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,770
So it would be convenient to have that.

66
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,470
Luckily, it's right up here.

67
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,190
Let's bring it down.

68
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,240
So here's Ito's lemma, and let's take a look

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,280
at how we can apply it to this situation.

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,570
Notice that the B squared here is

71
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:21,660
going to be replaced by this value here, by sigma S squared.

72
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,870
So I've written this in terms of S down here instead of x,

73
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,030
and what should we use for F?

74
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,010
The f that we're going to be interested in

75
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,667
is the logarithm of the stock price for the same reasons

76
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,750
that we've talked about earlier and when we looked

77
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,310
at discrete-time processes.

78
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,280
So let's go.

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:52,110
We have that F is equal to log S. Therefore,

80
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,520
the partial of F with respect to t is 0.

81
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,230
That was easy.

82
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:05,010
Partial of F with respect to S is 1/S.

83
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:13,170
And the second partial of F with respect to S squared is minus 1

84
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,360
over S squared.

85
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,370
What does Ito's lemma say?

86
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:25,230
It says that dF, d of log S, is going to be, well, let's see.

87
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:32,490
Partial of F-- partial of F with respect to t is zero,

88
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,200
so I'm not going to have an immediate dt term.

89
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:42,390
I'm going to have a term which will be partial of F

90
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,300
with respect to S dS.

91
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,280
But that's going to be--

92
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,720
well, here, let's write it out in two steps.

93
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:57,340
This is going to be dF dS dS, plus our Ito term, which

94
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,890
is going to be little b squared, which

95
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:06,760
is sigma S over 2, second partial of F with respect

96
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,030
to S squared, times dt.

97
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,300
Now, let's substitute.

98
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:22,730
This is going to be 1/S dS plus sigma S

99
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,270
quantity squared over 2 times minus 1

100
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,160
over s squared times dt.

101
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,260
Now, remember that this first term right here

102
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,750
is dS/S, which is what we started with.

103
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,360
I think we have it way back here, dS/S. There it is,

104
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,930
right here.

105
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,900


106
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,310
So let's take this value for dS/S,

107
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,690
which is mu dt plus sigma B, and substitute it

108
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,350
in right over here, shall we?

109
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:18,270
So this is equal to mu dt plus sigma dB.

110
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,710
That's from this first term.

111
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,950
And now we have this second term where

112
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,140
I'm going to have an S squared and a minus 1 over S squared.

113
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:37,100
So that's going to give me minus sigma squared over 2 times dt.

114
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,220
So let's combine these and clean this all up.

115
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:48,880
This tells us that d of log S is equal to mu

116
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,000
minus sigma squared over 2.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,670


118
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,110
Oops, changed our colors.

119
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,540


120
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,235
dt plus sigma dB.

121
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:10,160


122
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,820
So what have we done?

123
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,000
What we've accomplished right here

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,530
is that we've taken our original Ito process

125
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,020
and we've rewritten it.

126
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,590
Where we had dS/S, which was not an exact differential,

127
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,550
we've now been able to take the function log S and show

128
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,424
that it's an exact differential.

129
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:32,299
And on the right-hand side, we have something

130
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,470
which we can integrate.

131
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:42,610
So what we have is, if we do the integration, we have log ST/S0.

132
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,890
Since a difference of logs is the log of the ratio,

133
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,390
this is going to be mu minus sigma squared

134
00:08:52,390 --> 00:09:04,670
over 2 times t plus sigma times BT minus B0,

135
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,950
just as we had before, if we want to integrate it.

136
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,780


137
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,470
So if we compare with our notes, we

138
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,395
see that we've taken this format here

139
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:22,170
and we've shown that log S is an exact differential.

140
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,720
It looks like a Brownian motion, so that the logarithm of S

141
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,310
behaves as a Brownian motion with the same volatility.

142
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:41,440
Notice that sigma is unchanged here, but we have sigma dB.

143
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
And over here, compared to our previous example

144
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,120
of an ordinary arithmetic Brownian motion with drift,

145
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,610
the sigma dB term is the same, and the

146
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,290
left-- on the first term, rather,

147
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,420
on the deterministic term, we have mu

148
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,730
shifted by sigma squared over 2.

149
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,015
So this piece here, mu minus sigma squared over 2--

150
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:03,640
we'll be seeing a bunch of minus sigma squared over 2's running

151
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,920
around in some other formulas.

152
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,160
This is where it comes from.

153
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,570
It comes from the Ito term in doing this change of variables.

154
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,760
Then finally, if we want to integrate things up

155
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,110
in finite form, we just exponentiate

156
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,190
the last expression that I wrote down.

157
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,270
This model has the virtue that it excludes negative prices.

158
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,470
So because the logarithm goes from minus infinity to infinity

159
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,560
and we're exponentiating the result,

160
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,110
we never get negative numbers.

161
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,290
The exponential is always positive.

162
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,800
This is potentially-- it has the opposite problem.

163
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,860
We don't get negative prices, but also,

164
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,710
prices that obey this can never reach 0,

165
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,260
and unfortunately, real companies sometimes do

166
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,572
have stock prices that go to 0.

167
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:48,530
So that's something that we should think about,

168
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,470
whether it's a good approximation or a good model

169
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,210
to apply to real-world prices.

170
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:59,200
The thing that we see in our original model,

171
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,480
we can actually see that without solving it.

172
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,740
How do we see that?

173
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,200
We noticed that because these coefficient functions

174
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,300
have an S on the right-hand side, that as S approaches 0,

175
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,910
the coefficients of dt and dB are going to 0.

176
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,760
That means that there's not a lot of motion

177
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,190
either deterministically or randomly.

178
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,000
As the stock price goes to 0, everything quiets down,

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,730
and that's partly how it avoids the origin.

180
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,500
Another common model is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,

181
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,890
which is a continuous-time analog of the mean reversion

182
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,800
process that we saw in discrete time that

183
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,140
looks like the AR 1 process.

184
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,360
Now, here's a case where we can learn

185
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,300
a lot about the solution to the equation

186
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,580
without actually solving anything.

187
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,230
Let's take a look.

188
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,390
First thing we notice is that if the lambda term were 0,

189
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,950
we would just have an ordinary random walk.

190
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,670
So the stochastic term is very, very simple.

191
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,840
What about the deterministic term?

192
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,760
Well, this is a restoring force.

193
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,120
So I've suggestively called the constant here lambda times

194
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,460
S bar.

195
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,620
And here's an S. This is our dynamic random variable,

196
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,290
the same one that appears in the left-hand side.

197
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,650
So how can we think about this equation?

198
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:30,060
This says that the change in S, dS, has a random component.

199
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,270
This is the shock here, which is unconnected with anything.

200
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:41,110
But if S is below S bar and lambda is positive,

201
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,660
then this will be a positive value.

202
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:50,290
And if S is above S bar, then this will be a negative value.

203
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,920
So depending on the sign of lambda, if it's positive,

204
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,460
we basically have the mean-reverting dynamics

205
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,360
that we saw before, that we move toward the mean value,

206
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,850
and we would expect that the long-term mean value is

207
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,800
going to be S bar.

208
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,070
Now, can we use this as a model for stock prices?

209
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,730
Well, on the one hand, it's got a random component that

210
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,910
allows drift, and there's no boundedness on S,

211
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,220
so S could get to be infinitely large.

212
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,810
It could get to be negative.

213
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,720
On the other hand, the first term acts as a restoring force.

214
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,720
It keeps things relatively tight near S bar.

215
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,360
So depending on the magnitude of lambda compared

216
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,610
to the magnitude of sigma, it might

217
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,480
be OK for certain periods of time as a good approximation,

218
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,320
but it does allow the possibility,

219
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,980
with finite probability, that prices could go negative.

220
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,870
It's not strictly forbidden.

221
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,790
So this is a model that's commonly

222
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,130
used for many processes.

223
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,840
Most notably, we'll take a look when

224
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,700
we think about models for interest rates.

225
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,250


226
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,930
Another model used for interest rates

227
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,840
is the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process,

228
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,500
which looks a lot more complicated,

229
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,970
but really it's just one small modification

230
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,420
to the previous one, to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

231
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,890
So if I take a look here, I see this is the mean reversion

232
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,000
term.

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,170
But now, notice that the volatility term

234
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,590
is modified by this square root of rho that's here.

235
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,760
So think of rho as being a rate, an interest rate type variable.

236
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,400
And what does the square root of rho do here?

237
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,370
Well, I have a restoring force near rho bar,

238
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,960
but this does say that if rho approaches 0

239
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,190
from above, that the volatility term gets very small.

240
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,730
So maybe we have a chance of avoiding the origin.

241
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,550
Notice that we absolutely can't have negative values of rho

242
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,457
in this model.

243
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,040
The first term doesn't have a problem,

244
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,420
but taking square roots of negative numbers

245
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,050
now gives us not just a financial problem because it's

246
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,790
a mathematical one too because we're not

247
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,790
going to find or want to find solutions

248
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,412
in the complex numbers.

249
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:06,870
So we can sometimes break this down by a little bit further

250
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,390
manipulation, and here's one more application

251
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,440
of Ito's lemma.

252
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,400
We can transform things to simplify the stochastic term

253
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,350
and move all of the complexity into the deterministic term.

254
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,170
The stochastic terms are the ones

255
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,360
that are genuinely new for what we're doing.

256
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,060
They're the ones we might want to Monte Carlo model.

257
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,080
The coefficients of dt, as complicated as they might be,

258
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,600
follow the domain of usual kinds of differentials

259
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,300
that we would look at and standard analytic functions we

260
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,270
might consider.

261
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,090
So let's just see what happens if we have this transformation.

262
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,240
So we compute the necessary derivatives.

263
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,760
If F is equal to the square root of rho,

264
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,700
the partial of F with respect to t vanishes.

265
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,340
The first partial of F with respect to rho

266
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,220
is 1 over 2 square root of rho.

267
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,010
The next partial derivative is minus 1/4 rho to the minus 3/2.

268
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,270
We substitute that into Ito's lemma,

269
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,270
and we find that we can write the result in this form.

270
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,990
dF has this expression, this coefficient function for dt,

271
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,510
plus now a newly simplified coefficient function for dB.

272
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,630
So now if we want to see about avoiding behavior

273
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,790
on the origin, we just need to study

274
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,590
the behavior of this term.

275
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,730
The stochastic term is constant.

276
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,760
So we have mean reversion dynamics

277
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,920
for an appropriate range of parameters.

278
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,440
We do avoid the origin.

279
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,180
And this model is one that's used

280
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,804
for taking a look at interest rates and at term structure.

281
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:42,304
