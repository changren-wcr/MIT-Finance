1
00:00:01,247 --> 00:00:03,080
PROFESSOR: We have all the tools we need now

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,010
to derive the Black-Scholes equation for option pricing

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,260
and for derivative pricing generally.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,570
And the method in this case is just

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,330
as interesting as the result. We're

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,300
going to use the tools that we have with Ito's lemma,

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,700
and we're going to take stochastic differential

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,480
equations and reduce them to partial differential equations.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,100
And the technique that we use is,

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,740
instead of trying to solve for the randomness,

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,200
we're going to eliminate it completely.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,330
Let's see how that works.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,020
Suppose we've got a function V, which,

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,020
think of V as standing for the value of a derivative function.

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,190
So let's let the underlying-- so for concreteness,

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,927
we can think of a stock option, say a standard call

17
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:47,300
or a put option.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,490
So let V be the value of the option,

19
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,850
let S the value of the stock, generically

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,160
called the underlying, and a derivative is

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,860
something whose value depends on the value of something else.

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,470
So S is the stock price value, V is the value of our derivative,

23
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,800
t is our old friend time, and let's suppose

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,330
that the stock price follows geometric Brownian

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,250
motion, which we just solved.

26
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,120
So dS/S over S is mu dt plus sigma dB,

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,770
or if I multiply through by S, I have this expression here.

28
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,760
What about V?

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,170
Well let's write d--

30
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,060
So that's dS.

31
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,120
Let's write dV using Ito's lemma,

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,730
where we think of V as being a function of S,

33
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:37,160
and then S is this function of time and of randomness.

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,990
So applying Ito's lemma, we have dV is something times dt.

35
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,370
Now, I've grouped the Ito term here as a coefficient of dt,

36
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,230
so I have partial of V with respect

37
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,070
to t plus this term here, this sigma S, quantity

38
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,330
squared over 2.

39
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,120
That comes because of this sigma S,

40
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,520
so that shows up in the coefficient in the Ito term,

41
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,690
divided by 2, second partial of V with respect to S,

42
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:08,003
all of that times dt, plus partial of V with respect to S,

43
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,470
dS.

44
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,550
So that's just Ito's lemma applied to a generic function

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,810
V.

46
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,180
Now, let's combine the two in a portfolio.

47
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,610
So specifically, let's imagine that we're looking at the value

48
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,850
where we buy one option, and maybe we're

49
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,700
going to go short a certain number of shares.

50
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,970
Let's give that number a name.

51
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,460
Let's call it delta.

52
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,500
So the value of the portfolio is going

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,720
to be V, the value of the option,

54
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,720
plus the quantity of shares times the value of the shares.

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,360
Our quantity is going to be a negative quantity, so

56
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,550
minus delta, times the value of the shares.

57
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,980
So my portfolio value, which I'll designate by pi,

58
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,190
is V minus delta S. Now, I'm going

59
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,595
to start shifting around my portfolio a bit,

60
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:55,970
and the thing I'm going to change

61
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,440
is the amount of stock I own.

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,140
It's a lot easier to trade stock and a lot cheaper

63
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,040
and the market is much more liquid.

64
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,970
So I'm going to imagine I'm going to hold V fixed.

65
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,883
I'm going to hold the single option fixed.

66
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:09,050
If we had a different number, we could multiply this

67
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,210
all by some overall constant.

68
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,280
But I have one option which I'm long,

69
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,620
and I'm going to be short delta shares.

70
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,090
And therefore, the value of the portfolio

71
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,300
is going to be V minus delta S.

72
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,070
Let's look at this in differential form.

73
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,420
What happens as the stock price changes?

74
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,960
Well, the change in value of the portfolio, d pi,

75
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,340
is going to be dV minus delta dS.

76
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,980
So what do we know about dV and dS?

77
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,200
Well, for dV, we take this expression

78
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,870
that we have up here, and let's write it down below.

79
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,120
Notice that I have my dt term come straight down.

80
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,260
And then I have this extra term, partial of V with respect

81
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,940
to S times dS.

82
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,380
That comes over here.

83
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,320
And then I have this other term, which is much simpler

84
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,640
because it's stock itself.

85
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,470
It doesn't need any other partials.

86
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,980
So I have minus delta times dS.

87
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,130
So I've written the change in portfolio value

88
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,050
as an Ito process with something times dt plus something times

89
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,800
dS.

90
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,220
I don't need-- I could expand this dS out in terms of dB

91
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,750
if I wanted to, but it's actually

92
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,625
going to be a bit more convenient to leave it

93
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,610
right here.

94
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,470
So notice that the first term is deterministic.

95
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,790
The second term is stochastic because of the dS.

96
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,290
And gee, wouldn't it be nice if we could make that go away?

97
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,790
Well, we can.

98
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,180
Suppose that instead of dS vanishing, which

99
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,610
we can't do because it does obey this stochastic differential

100
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,760
equation, suppose we just multiply at time 0.

101
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,270
That is, suppose we choose delta to match dV/dS in such a way

102
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,665
that the coefficient is 0.

103
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:00,470


104
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,450
The stochastic term vanishes if we choose delta equals dV/dS.

105
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,480
That is-- that says that if we knew

106
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,810
the sensitivity of the price of the option

107
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,600
as the stock price changed, that would tell us

108
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,640
the number of shares to own.

109
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,750
So the right-hand side, in general, varies with time,

110
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,080
and so is going to be delta.

111
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,440
So there's no risk that's left over.

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,820
We've canceled out all of the risk,

113
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,270
but at the cost of having to keep

114
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,830
readjusting the number of shares that we have.

115
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,000
So as the market price changes, the exact number of shares

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
delta that we need changes.

117
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,130
And this is a strategy that's known as dynamic hedging.

118
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,810
So dynamic hedging means that we hold

119
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,790
a number of shares in relation to our option that's specified

120
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,590
in a very, very specific way.

121
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,800
Given all the values, I will know exactly how many shares

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,820
I need to trade.

123
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,850
But when things change, I will need to update those.

124
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,070
Having done that, though, there's

125
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,950
no risk in the portfolio because this term here vanishes

126
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:13,840
and d pi is just something times dt.

127
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,210
If there's no risk in the portfolio,

128
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,660
then the portfolio should earn the risk-free rate,

129
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,980
under penalty of arbitrage.

130
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,750
So it should be the case, then, that d pi should

131
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,590
grow at a rate r dt times pi.

132
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,050
So it's proportional to the value

133
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,240
of the portfolio times the risk-free rate times dt.

134
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,340
Well, let's see what that gives us.

135
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,000
So this is r dt times pi, but after all, pi

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,570
is the portfolio value, V minus delta S.

137
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:52,330
So I have that d pi should be r times v minus delta S dt,

138
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,300
and that's equal to what we had on the previous screen,

139
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,860
which is rV minus our expression for delta.

140
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,780
So that's going to be minus r, this r here.

141
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,510
So I have minus, I have the r in front,

142
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,900
I have delta is this partial of V with respect to S,

143
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,350
times S, dt.

144
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:25,550
So now if I want to equate the coefficients of dt

145
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,420
on the left-hand side and the right-hand side,

146
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,310
or I should say, on this screen and the previous one,

147
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,360
so here I have one expression for d pi,

148
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,980
and I have this other expression for d pi that just consists

149
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,330
of the first term here.

150
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,760
The second term we've arranged carefully have vanished.

151
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,080
So let's say that this expression for d pi

152
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,310
has to be equal to this expression for d pi,

153
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,280
and let's drop the dt's because all of the coefficients

154
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,330
are the same.

155
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,880
And then we have this expression,

156
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,870
that the partial of V with respect to t plus sigma squared

157
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:10,020
S squared over 2 d2 V dS squared has to be rV minus rS dV/dS.

158
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,750
So notice the right-hand side is proportional to r.

159
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,330
The left-hand side doesn't have any r's.

160
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,480
Each term has a V or some derivatives of V in it.

161
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,710
So let's put everything over on one side of the equation

162
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,270
and clean things up.

163
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,480
And now we have a partial differential equation

164
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,760
with no randomness left in it.

165
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,539
This equation is the Black-Scholes equation.

166
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,049
Partial of V with respect to t, the time variation

167
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:42,059
in the derivative, plus rS times partial of V with respect to S,

168
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:48,360
plus sigma squared S squared over 2 d2 V dS squared minus rV

169
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,460
is all equal to 0.

170
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,720
Notice that we have our two terms here and here

171
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,070
that are proportional to r.

172
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,670
And everything contains V, so this

173
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,490
is a homogeneous equation, linear in V,

174
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:11,950
of first and second partial derivatives,

175
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,020
plus a term with no derivatives here, this term here.

176
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,170
So we're going to talk about solving the equation,

177
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,860
but what can we say about the equation before we solve it?

178
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,520
Well, we know it's linear in V. Therefore,

179
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,320
we know it obeys superposition.

180
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,350
That is, if we were to have two or more solutions,

181
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,090
we could add them together and get another solution.

182
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,160
So any linear combination of solutions is also a solution.

183
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,500
For equations of this from, we know

184
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,370
that we find the exact unique solution to our problem

185
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,300
from the boundary conditions.

186
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,600
So we'll need to find some general solutions

187
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,740
to this equation.

188
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,370
But then to get the exact ones of interest to us for finance,

189
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,938
we'll need to apply boundary conditions.

190
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,480
What are the parameters in the model?

191
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,150
Well, there's some explicit parameters.

192
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,670
We have r and we have sigma.

193
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,750
Sigma is the volatility and r is the risk-free rate.

194
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,310
But wait a minute.

195
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,760
We started with three parameters, didn't we?

196
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,710
We introduced r at the end because we had a risk-free rate

197
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,080
because we'd eliminated risk by canceling out

198
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,760
the stochastic term.

199
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,670
We have the volatility that we would expect

200
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,080
because of the randomness.

201
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,350
Notice the special cases gets rather trivial

202
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,450
if we set sigma equal to 0.

203
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,360
But we had a third parameter mu.

204
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,410
Where did that go?

205
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,020


206
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,690
And there are some parameters here

207
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,660
that are implicit that come from the boundary conditions.

208
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,600
So if we're thinking about an option,

209
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,200
we need to give an expiration date,

210
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,750
we need to give a strike price, we

211
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,790
need to say whether it's a call or a put,

212
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,730
and all of those things are not part of the equation.

213
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,310
They're not part of the general solutions.

214
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,320
They will be part of the boundary conditions

215
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,060
and determine the specific solution that we have.

216
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,000
