1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,140
PROFESSOR: Let's try exercising a little bit more control

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,600
over the way in which delta t goes to zero

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,420
and the step size goes to zero so that we can

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,870
get a limit which has a finite variance instead of one that's

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,220
infinite or zero.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,380
So consider the following.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,950
Let's let delta t be T/n as before.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,070
This time, let's take our step size

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,710
to go as square root of delta t.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,440
That is, let's let lambda, which is the step

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,840
size that we're going to have in our process,

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,510
be square root of T/n.

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,780
The important part isn't the T. It's the square root of 1/n

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,990
that we have here.

15
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,445
So as before, we construct our series B delta t,

16
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:46,570
T as consisting of a number of steps

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,550
to represent the entire time horizon of length big T.

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,970
That's our overall duration in macroscopic time.

19
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,220
And we're going to have n infinitesimal steps epsilon t.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,120
Those steps are going to have this scaling.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,040
They're going to be square root of delta t times zt.

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,990
And what about the variance?

23
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,270
Well, the expectation is zero as always,

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,500
but now the variance is n times the variance

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:24,070
of the epsilon variables of our scaled step sizes.

26
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,830
That means that the variance is n delta

27
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,280
t times the variance of z.

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,250
This variance is just equal to one,

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,740
and this here is equal to big T because n delta

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,180
t is being held fixed.

31
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,800
We saw that up here.

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:52,480
So what we get is the variance is equal to T, which is finite.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,800
So by scaling our steps in a particular way,

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,920
by letting the step size go to zero as 1

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,790
over square root of n, or as the square root of delta t,

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,010
we can achieve a continuous limit

37
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,620
where delta t goes to zero and we still

38
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:14,020
end up with finite variance, not zero and not infinite.

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,630
This defines Brownian motion.

40
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,100
So Brownian motion is a process where

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,780
it's the limit we obtain by letting

42
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,790
delta t go to zero where we find that, relative to our starting

43
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,590
point, the endpoint is a Gaussian randomly distributed

44
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,920
variable with zero mean and a variance

45
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,440
equal to the length of time elapsed,

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,053
no matter what that time is.

47
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:43,970
Now, there are a lot of interesting properties

48
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,500
of Brownian motion, and we're not

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,700
going to derive all of them.

50
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,740
We're just going to work with the processes

51
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,680
to see the things that are most useful for finance.

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,580
The paths that we get that we obtain by taking this limit

53
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,680
are fractal in nature.

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,560
They're continuous paths, but they're nowhere differentiable,

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,860
so we're going to need to modify our rules for taking

56
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,590
derivatives to deal with these new paths.

57
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,560
Instead of looking at our usual definitions

58
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,920
for taking derivatives for doing calculus,

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,730
we're going to have to think about things probabilistically

60
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,510
and replace our usual limits by a kind of convergence

61
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,820
for probability distributions.

62
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,900
Now, we could have defined this abstractly from the beginning,

63
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,230
but it's useful for a lot of practical and conceptual

64
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,020
reasons to think about taking the limit in this way.

65
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,690
One of the interesting things is that this limit really

66
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,560
is universal.

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,020
We could have started with steps, remember,

68
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,190
that are drawn from any IID distribution that satisfies

69
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,430
the properties that we have for just our general things

70
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,420
for a standardized random variable.

71
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,050
So we're going to end up with something which has a Gaussian

72
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,080
distribution, regardless of where we started,

73
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,090
due to the central limit theorem.

74
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,740
Interestingly, we'll see that when

75
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,720
we want to do numerical approximations,

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,750
we want to do Monte Carlo option pricing, for example,

77
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,020
we're going to re-discretize, and it'll

78
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,580
look like we've come full circle,

79
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,900
and then we're going back to where we started.

80
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,670
Now, there is more than one limit possible,

81
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,440
and there's a literature on this, which

82
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,329
we're not going to go into.

83
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,410
I want to point out that the essential ingredient

84
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,490
for finance is that we have non-anticipating processes.

85
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,210
That is, we're taking a limit as t evolves

86
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,950
where we don't know what's in the future.

87
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,230
It's possible to take things that are symmetric,

88
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,750
that are agnostic between past and future,

89
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,120
or even things that go the other way and that anticipate

90
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,060
the future.

91
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,590
So there are some mathematical subtleties

92
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,390
in those different limits.

93
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,700
I'll point out what the rules are for the limit

94
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,550
that we're interested in, which is defined in just the way

95
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,430
that we went through right now.

96
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,830
So what are some of the properties of Brownian paths?

97
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,970
Well, we started by taking a finite path,

98
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,360
we broke it into infinitesimals, and we came up

99
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,980
with some properties that are true

100
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,330
of the finite macroscopic path.

101
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,710
So one of them is that the properties of the path

102
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,940
depend only on the time differences.

103
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,120
So if we think of X of t1 and t2 as being Brownian motion that

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,420
goes between time t1 and t2, we can think of it

105
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,180
as the difference between the endpoints, all right?

106
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,220
So the initial point doesn't matter.

107
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,410
The results that we have are a function

108
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,740
only of the elapsed time between the two.

109
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,150
It doesn't matter what the origin of time is.

110
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,130
So if we shift time forward or backward by any constant,

111
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,260
the properties that we have are the same.

112
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,150
The distribution is the same.

113
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,000
The variance only depends on the elapsed time

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,650
between the endpoints.

115
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,790
But that being said, the endpoints

116
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,090
don't need to be separated by a finite amount of time.

117
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,750
We could bring them back to where big T gets smaller

118
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,150
and smaller and smaller and to the point where

119
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,950
we get a new infinitesimal.

120
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,830
So we started by taking a finite path,

121
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,050
we chopped it into infinitesimals,

122
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,390
we got properties of that finite path,

123
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,600
and now I'm going to shrink the length of that path back

124
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,440
to delta t.

125
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,710
So this might seem as though we've done nothing

126
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,290
and we're going full circle, but I remind you

127
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,120
that our initial discrete process for any finite size

128
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,600
delta t could have had non-Gaussian distribution,

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,360
and the Brownian paths are Gaussian at all scales.

130
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,830
So if I look at a small chunk, a small piece

131
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,030
of infinitesimal time evolution in Brownian motion

132
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,860
for a Brownian path, and I'll call

133
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,390
that interval dB sub t just to remind you

134
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,360
of the time dependence.

135
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,545
Little subscript t is notation you'll see sometimes.

136
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:54,920
It's not particularly meaningful.

137
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,310
It's just a reminder of the time dependence.

138
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,800
This is going to be normally distributed

139
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,670
with mean zero, of course, and variance equal to the time

140
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,560
interval, which is delta t.

141
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,210
So if we'd started with something

142
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,540
that, for example, was a discrete random variable, maybe

143
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,040
with plus or minus one, we wouldn't

144
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,540
have had this property at all.

145
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,540
At small scales our granular thing

146
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,980
would have recovered the building blocks that we had.

147
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,100
So here we do have this universal behavior

148
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,670
for Brownian paths, that they're Gaussian at all time scales,

149
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,890
big and small.

150
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,550
They also are independent.

151
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,270
So if I look at the covariance taken

152
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,100
at two different times for two different infinitesimal time

153
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,370
intervals, I find that they're equal to zero if the times are

154
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,070
different, or the variance of the process

155
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,430
is dt if t and t prime are equal.

156
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,220
We can also talk about integrating the process

157
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,300
to go from an infinitesimal back to the finite values.

158
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,270
And sometimes we'll write this in integral form

159
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,360
as saying that BT minus B0, or I can

160
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,250
put the B0 on the right-hand side,

161
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,590
is the integral from time zero to time

162
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,780
big T of our infinitesimal.
