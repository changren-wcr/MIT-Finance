1
00:00:00,745 --> 00:00:02,370
PROFESSOR: So we have integral formulas

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,500
and we have differential formulas.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,550
What are we going to do?

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,930
What are we going to use?

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,850
The answer is we're going to use them both.

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,510
Most of the time we're going to be working in differential form

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,330
and constructing what are known as stochastic differential

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,740
equations that involve things like that infinitesimal dB

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,900
that I showed you on the previous slide.

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,190
That's the small time limit of our finite Brownian motion

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,760
path.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,830
And we'll see these stochastic differentials

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,100
involve these Gaussian random variables.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,110
And under certain circumstances, we

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,810
can reduce them to partial differential equations,

16
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,460
familiar from calculus, that don't have any randomness.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,510
And then we can apply normal techniques

18
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,530
that we have from the theory of partial differential equations.

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,980
However, we also sometimes use the integral form,

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,710
where we want to take a differential version

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,010
and integrate it up.

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,610
That's something that we need to think

23
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,950
about a little bit differently from doing integrals

24
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,620
in ordinary single or multiple-variable calculus

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,450
because the thing that we're integrating

26
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,300
is a random variable, and its randomness

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,710
depends on where it is in time.

28
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,102
So we can't just do a straightforward integration.

29
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:14,310
We need to think about the results of the integration

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,700
as themselves representing a probability distribution.

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,680
But an important example of where

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,040
we think about things, these integral forms

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,630
for finite values, is in doing option pricing,

34
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,070
and a discrete approximation to that on a computer

35
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,100
that we'll be seeing where we do Monte Carlo simulations.

36
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,590
So we might like to--

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,310
it turns out that we can define the price of an option

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,720
as an expectation over a bunch of Brownian paths

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,450
that are integrated over a finite time period.

40
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,340
And for that, we'll want to have our integral representation

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,520
of what the paths are and what their probability

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,600
distribution is.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,440


44
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,570
Finally, let's do a quick version

45
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,650
of our generalized random walk because just pure Brownian

46
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,370
motion is a bit boring.

47
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,762
It's like a standardized random variable.

48
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:13,220
There's not a whole lot that we can

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,710
do with it if it only depends on time

50
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,510
and it doesn't have any parameters.

51
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,070
We'd like to include something that

52
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,530
could represent our old friends, return and risk.

53
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,630
So remember what we did with our basic random walk

54
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,520
to get to the generalized random walk.

55
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,980
We introduced parameters.

56
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,970
So we started with a return variable

57
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,820
for our log-normal process where we

58
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,490
took our variable z, our standardized random variable,

59
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,520
we multiplied it times a constant,

60
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,620
sigma, to represent the step size,

61
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,530
and we possibly added another constant mu that

62
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,000
represented the drift.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
So I've written this as mu 0 and sigma 0

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,350
because I don't exactly know right now what

65
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,760
scale I want to use.

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,310
And let's think of those as being the bare parameters

67
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,010
for constructing a process where the time interval was fixed.

68
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,880
So when delta t was equal to 1, this was how we set things up.

69
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,650
We said that if I had bare parameters mu 0 and sigma 0,

70
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,210
then the random variable constructed in this way, r sub

71
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:19,220
t, was normally distributed with mean mu and variance

72
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,560
sigma squared.

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,910
Then, if I added a whole bunch of them

74
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,630
together to get some finite-length path

75
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,780
of multiple steps, I could go from 0

76
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,170
to a value of, let's say, big T, letting big T be an integer

77
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,280
number, by aggregating a bunch of individual time steps,

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,720
mostly T of them.

79
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,300
And because the logarithm of a product

80
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,200
is the sum of the logarithms and because the variances add

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,720
and all our usual rules, we see that by adding together big T

82
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,550
variables, I could get a process that was normally distributed

83
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,930
with parameter mu 0 t, variance sigma 0

84
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,920
squared T relative to the bare parameters.

85
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,770
Well, now we'd like to let delta t go to 0.

86
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,340
So how are we going to do it?

87
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,640
What we'd like to do is find a way

88
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,760
that we can pick a scaling for our parameters

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,490
such that we get finite values that we

90
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,910
can interpret financially when we get our Brownian motion

91
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,720
limit.

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,430
So we'd like to think about getting the same kind of value,

93
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,230
a finite path, logarithm of ST over S0, same

94
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,430
as we had up here, by taking the limit as delta t goes to 0.

95
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,640
How are we going to do that?

96
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,600
Well, we're going to have our path consist

97
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,790
of a bunch of steps, but now we're

98
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,280
going to let our parameters scale in the following way.

99
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,140
We're going to let the drift term go as mu delta t

100
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,820
and we're going to let the step size

101
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,540
term go as sigma square root of delta t.

102
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,320
And with that particular scaling, when we take n steps,

103
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,480
where n is t over delta t, as we saw before,

104
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,210
we'll get a finite result. So it's the same thing

105
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:05,930
that we saw.

106
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,350
The part that's random is the square root of delta t.

107
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:15,210
The part that's deterministic, a 1/n result is just fine.

108
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:23,120
So if we do these sums, I've got n terms here, mu delta t times,

109
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,550
each term is going to be identical,

110
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,390
times t over delta t.

111
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,210
That's going to give me mu times t.

112
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,200
Over here, I can scale out in front a sigma square root

113
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,170
of delta t times the sum of the z's.

114
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,140
But the square root of delta t grouped

115
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,590
with the z, if I only pull the sigma out in front,

116
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,370
then I have exactly my definition of my Brownian path.

117
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,330
So with this scaling, by introducing mu and sigma

118
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,090
in precisely this way where the drift and the volatility

119
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,810
of a process as we let delta t go to 0,

120
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,790
we get the finite result that we can

121
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,880
have stock price evolution, let's say,

122
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,970
represented by a random path that

123
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,140
has mean mu times the length of time.

124
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,500
And sigma integral dB is going to give us

125
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,960
something which is finite--

126
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,600
for finite times, is a random variable

127
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,790
that's drawn from mu of--

128
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,810
excuse me, from N of mu, t sigma squared t.

129
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,890
That is, it is going to have a mean that

130
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,440
grows with time linearly and a variance that

131
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,650
grows with time linearly and a volatility that grows

132
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,810
with the square root of time.

133
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,640
More generally, we don't need to let mu and sigma be constant.

134
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,230
If they depend on time, if they're deterministic functions

135
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,470
of time, then we could think about letting

136
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,180
them change slowly in time.

137
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,860
If they're smooth functions of time,

138
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,700
or actually just integrable functions of time,

139
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,780
we can have this general result, but provided that they're not

140
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,170
random variables.

141
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,310
So the typical case is mu and sigma are constant,

142
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,220
but we'll see shortly that we can generalize even

143
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,440
further when we introduce Ito processes.
