1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,040
PROFESSOR: When we optimize a portfolio of assets,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,990
what we'd like to do is think about finding

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,037
an optimal trade-off of risk and return.

4
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:11,370
What do we have as a constraint?

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,680
Well, typically, we have a budget constraint.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,390
We've got some amount of capital,

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,030
and we can assign weights to different risky assets,

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,080
let's say.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,050
Let's call those weights w sub i for the weight, the fraction

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,180
of capital invested in asset i.

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,240
And, depending on what choices I make,

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,240
I'll earn a different return and have different levels of risk.

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,980
So, if we think of w as being a control variable that we're

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,070
free to choose, but it's subject to a constraint,

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,680
a budget constraint, where the sum of the weights

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,030
need to equal 1, we can ask the question about how do we

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,170
maximize return, how do we minimize risk,

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,360
provided that we've got appropriate measures

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,480
for both of them.

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,570
And then we can do this using the Lagrange multiplier method.

21
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,900
So we might think of the risk as being

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,325
related to the variance of the portfolio.

23
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:02,700
And the variance of the portfolio

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,379
for a weighted set of returns, as we've seen before,

25
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,390
is a quadratic form.

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,550
And here I've written it in vector notation.

27
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,120
It's w transpose times the covariance matrix, which

28
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,540
is the covariance matrix where the elements Cij are

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,250
the covariance between the returns on asset i and asset j,

30
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,330
times w again.

31
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,110
So it's quadratic in the w's, but

32
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,060
with lots of off-diagonal terms, potentially,

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,400
where the assets have correlations among themselves.

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,700
And the expected returns are just the weighted average

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,800
of the vector of expected returns

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,000
on the individual assets.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,600
So C and mu correspond to the covariance and expected returns

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,340
on the individual assets.

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,870
Sigma squared p and mu p, the p stands for portfolio.

40
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,030
Those are based on a linear combination.

41
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,820
And w is the set of linear weighting factors

42
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,210
that we get to choose.

43
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,170
I will take mu to be excess returns in excess

44
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,515
of the risk-free rate so that we don't have a little minus r sub

45
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:03,210
f's to subtract off everywhere.

46
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,960
At least for the people who have taken finance courses,

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,210
you know that we always need to look at things

48
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,990
relative to the risk-free rate.

49
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,470
So this would be a problem that sounds

50
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,980
great for constraint optimization for the Lagrange

51
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,300
multiplier method.

52
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,910
What do we know about these different components?

53
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,380
Well, one thing that we know is that the covariance matrix can

54
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,720
be expanded out in terms of a quadratic sum,

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,630
in terms of diagonal terms that involve

56
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,030
only the variance of the individual assets

57
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,450
and that involve cross terms.

58
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,030
Notice that, in this expression, every time there's

59
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,510
a w that appears, it's always multiplied by a sigma.

60
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,640
So I have w1 sigma 1 quantity squared.

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,900
And here I might have w1 sigma 1 w2 sigma 2.

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,400
Those always appear together.

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,220
Rho ij is the correlation matrix.

64
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,270
So the covariance matrix is symmetric.

65
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,550
And it's symmetric because the variance and covariance

66
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,940
between asset i and asset j is the same as between j and i.

67
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,650
So it's obviously symmetric.

68
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,480
It's positive definite.

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,800
And it's positive-definite.

70
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,180
We know that it's positive because the variance is

71
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,920
obtained by taking the expectation

72
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,280
of a positive quantity.

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,710
So it must be positive.

74
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,830
And that means that, no matter what w's we put in there,

75
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,630
we're always going to get a positive quantity.

76
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,660
So this is a positive-definite matrix.

77
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,400
And that means that all of its eigenvalues are positive.

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,090
Now, we know that it can't be-- it has to be non-negative.

79
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,760
How do we know it's strictly positive?

80
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,010
Well, for the covariance matrix to have a zero eigenvalue,

81
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,365
that would mean that it's a singular matrix

82
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:48,390
and that it's not invertible.

83
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,190
And one reason that that could happen

84
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,860
is that we either have risk-free assets, which

85
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,110
have no correlation to anything else,

86
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,810
or that we have linearly dependent data sets.

87
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,380
Whenever there's a matrix where multiple rows or columns are

88
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,410
linearly dependent, the matrix is less than full rank.

89
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,580
It's not invertible.

90
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,420
And it has zero eigenvalues.

91
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,450
So we're going to specifically exclude those cases.

92
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,350
So we're going to assume that all of the assets

93
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,870
are linearly independent.

94
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,490
And that means that our matrix is

95
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,140
going to be positive-definite.

96
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,490
It's going to be symmetric.

97
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,620
And it's going to be invertible.

98
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,180
That also means that we could use

99
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,160
it to define a quadratic form on the vector space of weights w

100
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,450
if we wanted to think more broadly.

101
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,450
And we can use that to come up with kind

102
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,700
of a geometric picture of risk that we won't need

103
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,850
for our portfolio optimization, but, in this language,

104
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,470
we can think of looking at comparing

105
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,940
two different portfolios that are described by weight factors

106
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,780
w and w prime and say their inner product in this space

107
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,230
is related to the w transpose times C times w prime.

108
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,760
This is the inner product here.

109
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,050
And this vanishes.

110
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,700
We would say these two portfolios

111
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,255
are orthogonal if they are uncorrelated.

112
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:04,630
So that's just a convenient thing

113
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,000
that you could keep in mind for other applications,

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,610
but not required for portfolio variance.

115
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,940
And in a very simple, concrete case, we could get some data,

116
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,450
and we can visualize what we mean by an optimal portfolio

117
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,670
just by crunching some numbers without doing

118
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,590
this kind of algebra at all.

119
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,310
Here's an example.

120
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,400
Suppose I look at historical data,

121
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,845
and I take time series returns for a couple of assets,

122
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:30,040
in this case, the S&P 500 index, which

123
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,380
I've denoted by ticker symbol SPX,

124
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,920
and the gold ETF, the Exchange-Traded Fund whose

125
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,590
value is based on the deposits of gold.

126
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,620
And I wanted to know, what would be an optimal portfolio

127
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,000
to hold consisting of these two assets?

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,480
So what I can do is I can look at the time

129
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,260
series of historical returns.

130
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,470
And, as a function of the weight vectors,

131
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,200
I can compute what the portfolio returns were.

132
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,390
So I can say suppose I did a portfolio that

133
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,380
was 50-50, that was 90-10, that was 10-90, that was 40-60.

134
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,220
So, for each possible relative weighting of the two

135
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,960
where the weights have to add up to 1,

136
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,710
I can compute what the time series of returns was.

137
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,660
Now, there's really only one number

138
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,640
that matters, relative weight of the two,

139
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,920
because they satisfy a budget constraint.

140
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,660
The two numbers have to add up to 1.

141
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,030
So I can think of this as being a function

142
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,480
of a single variable, the relative weight,

143
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,880
say, of gold versus equities in this portfolio.

144
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,540
And I do want to be careful in thinking about this averaging

145
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,710
that, since I'm constructing my views based on past time

146
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,850
series, if I talk about, say, a 50-50 portfolio, if I'm just

147
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,660
going to take a 50-50 average of the two time series of returns,

148
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,117
that would mean that's not a buy-and-hold portfolio.

149
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:47,700
It implies that, in every time period,

150
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,620
say every month, that I'm rebalancing the portfolio back

151
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,370
to 50-50 so that that is indeed the portfolio return.

152
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,460
So, subject to those provisos, you can do the calculation.

153
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,790
And, if you do it, you get, for each value from, say,

154
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,540
0-100 to 100-0, if we're weighting between the two,

155
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,030
we could compute what the time series of returns is.

156
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,430
And then we could plot some objective function.

157
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,520
Perhaps, it's the Sharpe ratio, which is the expected return,

158
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,540
or the expected excess return above the risk-free rate,

159
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,840
divided by the standard deviation of the returns.

160
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,910
That's a scalar quantity that gets larger

161
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,060
when there are higher returns or when the risk is lower.

162
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,250
There are other functions we could consider instead,

163
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,950
but here I've plotted an example of Sharpe

164
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,870
ratio versus the fraction of gold that's in my portfolio.

165
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,620
And, just looking at this picture,

166
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,820
we can see that the Sharpe ratio gets better and better as I

167
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,250
increase gold up to a certain point, and then it goes down.

168
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,730
So this is fairly typical of what we might see.

169
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,400
And, obviously, the goal of optimization

170
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,610
would be to find this point.

171
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,030
This would be the optimal Sharpe ratio.

172
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,270
It's a particular choice of objective function

173
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,290
and not uniquely determined.

174
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,470
But, for that choice of objective function,

175
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,310
this would be the maximum value.

176
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,430
Now, for a different choice of function,

177
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,420
the maximum might be somewhere else.

178
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,090
If I looked at a different data set

179
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,520
over a different period of time, the values

180
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,890
might move because maybe the return samples

181
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,390
I have are not representative.

182
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,767
Maybe the return processes are not stationary.

183
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,350
And there are a couple of other things

184
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,180
that we know could happen based on what

185
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,240
we know about functions, even of a single variable.

186
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,490
There might be multiple extrema.

187
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,180
Could there be more than one maximum?

188
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,370
Could the maximum be at the endpoints?

189
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,900
Could it be either at 0 or 1?

190
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,520
Maybe the function is monotonically

191
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,260
increasing or decreasing.

192
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,530
And another possibility that's important financially

193
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,830
is, could there be extrema that are outside

194
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,780
of the obvious budget area?

195
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,805
I looked between 0% and 100%.

196
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,200
But if the weight--

197
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,690
if we continued this curve, suppose

198
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,010
it was increasing from the beginning and up to here,

199
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,100
and then it continued, and it peaked somewhere out here,

200
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,530
say at a value of 130% in gold and minus 30 in equities,

201
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,610
let's say.

202
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,480
That would correspond to a maximum which isn't achievable

203
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,960
if the w's need to be positive or bounded between 0 and 1,

204
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,580
but it would correspond to something

205
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,640
we could conceivably do in a levered portfolio

206
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,080
where we borrow money to be able to invest more money than we

207
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,150
initially have in our account and where

208
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,580
we take short positions that would be represented

209
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,790
by negative weights.

210
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,610
So here, in the picture I've drawn,

211
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,310
we have an obvious solution that lies--

212
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,050
it satisfies the budget constraint,

213
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,470
and it lies in a range where w is between 0 and 1

214
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,810
without imposing any additional rules on bounds.

215
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,290
So it's an interior extremum point.

216
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,700
So that's just a visualization.

217
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,450
Next, we'd like to take a look at applying

218
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,360
this systematically for portfolios that may

219
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,680
have many more than two assets.

220
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,000
