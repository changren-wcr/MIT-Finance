1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,580
PROFESSOR: In the presence of constraints,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,307
it's not enough to just find critical points.

3
00:00:05,307 --> 00:00:07,140
Constraints are everywhere in the real world

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,270
and certainly in finance and economics.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,910
We have finite resources that we need to allocate.

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,240
We have a finite budget.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,350
We have a finite risk limit that we shouldn't exceed.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,900
So we're often asked to solve problems

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,490
where we're looking for the best solution or a maximum value

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,420
of some scalar function subject to a constraint.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,978
And those constraints can take different forms.

12
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:31,020
They might be equalities.

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,145
They might be inequalities.

14
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:35,140
They might involve one or multiple variables.

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,710
So let's start at the beginning with the Lagrange multiplier

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,200
method for solving equality constraints

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,560
in multidimensional optimization problems.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,900
Here's a picture to help visualize things.

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,530
This is a contour map of the neighborhood

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,380
of Mount Washington showing its hiking trails.

21
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,510
Mount Washington is the tallest point in New England.

22
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,880
And, if I asked you to leave MIT and to find the tallest point

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,430
and you had a functional description of this,

24
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,650
you could certainly find lots of local extrema,

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,790
but the global maximum would be at 6,288 feet

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,040
right here at the top of Mount Washington.

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,590
But you notice there are lots of hiking trails around the top

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,700
of Mount Washington.

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,750
And there's even an auto road here,

30
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,050
and there's a railroad that goes down the backside.

31
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,090
But, if you were looking for a tranquil way,

32
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,540
you might, say, be over here at the Appalachian Mountain Club

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,040
Lake of the Clouds Hut.

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,190
And you'd like to hike over here to Tuckerman Ravine, which

35
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,840
descends rather steeply.

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,490
And you'd like to do it without going

37
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,990
through the summit at all.

38
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,090
Well, a question you certainly could ask

39
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,660
is, along a trail of my choice, say

40
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,150
this one, what's the highest point that I would reach along

41
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,420
the trail?

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,750
So the trail represents your constraint.

43
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,360
You're not free to go anywhere in latitude and longitude

44
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,350
on this map.

45
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,580
That's your constraint.

46
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,670
But we can ask, as you go along the trail, at every point,

47
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,643
you're definitely at some elevation above sea level.

48
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:00,560
And we could think of that as being a function

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,530
h of x, y where x and y give your latitude

50
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,220
and longitude for example.

51
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,460
And we could ask a very reasonable question.

52
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,919
If there are no cliffs here, even

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,780
though it descends steeply, and if you don't

54
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,870
fall into a crevasse, we could ask,

55
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,880
what was the highest point along that trail?

56
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,160
One of the things that we can see immediately

57
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,470
is, whatever it is, wherever the highest point

58
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,360
is along this path, it has nothing

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,190
to do with the global maximum.

60
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,940
It doesn't go anywhere near the summit of Mount Washington.

61
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,560
OK, so it's not enough to just take a function

62
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,780
and find its extrema because the answer

63
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,140
that we're looking for may not be anywhere nearby.

64
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,277
The answer to doing this is also--

65
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:44,360
let's think about this a little bit geometrically.

66
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,910
Imagine that we're ascending.

67
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,390
Say we're climbing through Tuckerman Ravine.

68
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,840
And we're going to go along here.

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,790
What does it mean?

70
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,050
As long as we're ascending, we are crossing contour lines.

71
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,690
Contour lines, remember, are level sets

72
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,930
where the altitude is constant, where our scalar function

73
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,280
h is constant.

74
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,180
What it means to reach an extremum along the path

75
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,980
or to reach a maximum along the path

76
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,230
is that you're no longer crossing contour lines.

77
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,780
That is your direction of travel,

78
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,600
the tangent along the path that you're taking,

79
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,660
is parallel to the contour lines themselves.

80
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,340
The point at which you reach a maximum

81
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,110
is when the direction of your trail

82
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,830
is along the direction of a contour line, at least

83
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,820
instantaneously.

84
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,310
In either direction going forward or backward,

85
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,690
you would be going down at a critical point.

86
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,110
So the geometrical condition we have

87
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,710
is that the direction of the path

88
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,110
should be tangent to the level sets.

89
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,200
And that we can state as a condition on the gradients

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,780
of the two functions, one describing the constraint

91
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,360
along the path and the other describing

92
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,080
the shape of the level sets of the function h

93
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,260
without the constraints.

94
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,080
And, when we overlay the two, we say

95
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,830
they need to be in the same direction.

96
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,470
And that's what the Lagrange multiplier

97
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,610
method is going to give us.

98
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,320


99
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,380
So here is the Lagrange multiplier method.

100
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,380
What we're going to do is take our original unconstrained

101
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,530
function, h of x, y, and we're going

102
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,800
to construct a new function called the Lagrange function,

103
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,050
which is going to have one extra variable, which

104
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,610
is a variable called lambda.

105
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,650
And this extra variable lambda is known

106
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,540
as the Lagrange multiplier.

107
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,190
And the way I construct the function

108
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,430
is I take my original function, h of x, y,

109
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,960
and I subtract lambda--

110
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,600
it's linear lambda in this new variable--

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,250
times, in parentheses, I have my constraint.

112
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,270
So imagine that the constraint is given by some equation

113
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,670
in x and y, saying what they need to satisfy.

114
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,780
x and y is equal to some constant.

115
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,500
So all I've done is I've taken my original function

116
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,480
minus lambda times the constraint itself.

117
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,950
So the strategy here, in practical terms,

118
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,480
is to take a problem in two parts,

119
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,420
maximize the function subject to a constraint,

120
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,940
and turn it into a simpler problem in more variables.

121
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,270
So the problem in three variables,

122
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,850
with x, y, and lambda, is going to have no constraints.

123
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,620
So the idea is that we're going to take all three

124
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,250
partial derivatives now, set all three of them equal to 0.

125
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,290
That will impose the condition that the vectors--

126
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,210
that the direction of my constraint

127
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,400
is along the direction of the level sets.

128
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,690
And it's easy to solve.

129
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,200
So let's take a look at a couple of examples,

130
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,240
first in algebraic functions, and then we'll

131
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,900
see how this applies in finance, most notably, to the case

132
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,060
of portfolio optimization.

133
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,980


134
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,730
The general method is this.

135
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,410
If we have multiple constraints, we introduce one constant

136
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,460
called the Lagrange multiplier per constraint.

137
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,320
We define the Lagrange function, which

138
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,910
is linear in the constraints.

139
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,840
It's got extra variables, one per Lagrange multiplier,

140
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,000
but it has a simpler solution.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,620
We take the derivatives with respect

142
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,700
to each of the original variables.

143
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,080
And, of course, that gives us the original partial

144
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,110
derivatives we would have had plus something that's

145
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,280
linear in lambda or the other Lagrange multipliers.

146
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,410
And, when we take the derivative with respect

147
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,000
to the Lagrange multipliers, the equations

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,390
we get when we set those derivatives to 0

149
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,860
are just the constraint equations themselves.

150
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,290
So that's it.

151
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,630
Then we find the critical points,

152
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,673
and we can substitute them in and make

153
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:34,840
sure they solve the problem.

154
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,100
We can check second derivatives to make sure that, in fact, we

155
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,190
have a maximum and not a minimum or a point of inflection.

156
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,352
And, usually, not always, but in many problems,

157
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:47,560
it doesn't even matter what the Lagrange function is.

158
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,220
What we care is the location of the extremal value, not

159
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,030
the value itself.

160
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,672
So that's worth keeping in mind because it can simplify things.

161
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:57,130
So, for example, if we want to pick

162
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,410
a different form of the Lagrange function

163
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,120
that's easier to solve, but where

164
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,960
we know it has the same critical points, that's OK.

165
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,630
We can do that.

166
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,930
And, in fact, when it comes to the constraint,

167
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,360
we have a lot of freedom as to how we could change it

168
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,390
because, at the critical points, the constraint function is

169
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,235
going to vanish.

170
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,110
So let's take a look at a couple of examples.

171
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,540


172
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,620
So here's a chance for you to do your own concept check.

173
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,780
And you can pause the video at this point.

174
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,800
And then we'll solve it together.

175
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,960
But here's the example.

176
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,200
Let's let h of x, y be the function x plus y.

177
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,260
And let's let the constraint be that the solutions,

178
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,200
the maximum, minimum, or extrema that we're looking for,

179
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,280
have to lie along a circle of radius r.

180
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,385
r here is just a radius.

181
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:44,200
It's not the risk-free rate.

182
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,450
So we construct our Lagrange function,

183
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,080
L of x, y, and lambda, to be our function h, x plus y,

184
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,030
minus lambda times the constraint.

185
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,660
So, if you'd like, pause the video.

186
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,770
See if you can solve it.

187
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,872
Find the critical points.

188
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:01,330
And then come back, and we'll take a look at this together.

189
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,775


190
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:09,940
OK, so let's compute some derivatives together.

191
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,370
What we find is we take the first partial of L

192
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,820
with respect to x.

193
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,180
We get 1 minus 2 lambda.

194
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,310
Notice it's we have lambda here.

195
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,650
We're always going to have something linear in lambda

196
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,470
because this is left over, and the partial derivatives

197
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,800
act on the constraint.

198
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,750
So that tells us that x is 1 over 2 lambda.

199
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,670
I take the partial with respect to y.

200
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,440
My function is symmetric in x and y.

201
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,450
So, no surprise, I get that y is 1 over 2 lambda.

202
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,110
And now, because x and y are both equal to 1 over 2 lambda,

203
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,400
I can eliminate lambda.

204
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,409
And I see that x is equal to y.

205
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,299
So I'm almost done.

206
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,040
x is equal to y, but they also have

207
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
to lie along the constraint, which

208
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,690
means that the sum of their squares

209
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,060
has to be equal to r squared.

210
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,820
So, if I substitute x equals y into this constraint equation--

211
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,470
and notice the constraint equation

212
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,500
I get just by differentiating with respect to lambda.

213
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,840
There's no lambda in the original function h.

214
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,290
And there's a linear in lambda before the constraint.

215
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,420
So differentiating with respect to lambda just

216
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,830
gives me back my constraint.

217
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,020
It's exactly what I would have had before,

218
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,450
but, whereas, without the Lagrange multiplier method,

219
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,720
you might have tried to solve for y in terms of x--

220
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,250
you could have written y as being

221
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,800
plus or minus the square root of r squared minus x squared,

222
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,650
substituted it back into h, and then tried

223
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,410
to solve for that extremum.

224
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,050
You'd have had a more complicated function and fewer

225
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,782
variables.

226
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:31,240
Here we're going to keep everything

227
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,370
where all the variables start on equal footing.

228
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,140
We substitute into the constraint.

229
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,820
We find there are two solutions.

230
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,190
x and y are each equal to plus or minus r

231
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,260
over square root of 2.

232
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,760
Either they're both plus signs, or they're both minus signs.

233
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,470
And it's easy to check that either,

234
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,020
at 45 degrees in the first quadrant

235
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,520
or in the third quadrant, we have

236
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,680
two points on the circle, which represent

237
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,620
the maximum and the minimum values of x plus y.

238
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,880
And, if we substitute in the values,

239
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,750
these are the values, square root of 2 times r

240
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,180
or minus square root of 2r, OK?

241
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,950
So that one you might have guessed just

242
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,650
from symmetry of the problem, but this is the method.

243
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,380
It's really very easy, very straightforward.

244
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,140
Let's do another example.

245
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,970
Here, again, pause the video.

246
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,400
Take a look at doing this.

247
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,190
And then, after you've checked your own concepts

248
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,900
and your own math, come back and compare.

249
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,470
A couple of things to note, our function in this case

250
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,510
is a general quadratic form with a cross term.

251
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,300
So it may not be obvious immediately where the extrema

252
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,930
or whether they're maxima or minima or saddle points.

253
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,360
And we're going to look at this quadratic form,

254
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,470
instead of linear on our previous example,

255
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,080
and we're going to have it lie along the unit circle.

256
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,920
So, subject to the constraint that points lie along the unit

257
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,070
circle, we want to ask where are the maxima and minima

258
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,100
of the function h of x, y.

259
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,440
We construct a Lagrangian by taking

260
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,080
the quadratic form minus lambda times the constraint.

261
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,660
Now, one thing to consider as you're

262
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,480
doing this, a couple of things that don't matter, one of them

263
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,130
is the sign of lambda.

264
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,380
If you change lambda to minus lambda,

265
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,110
if you change, in fact, the sign of the constraint to 1

266
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,570
minus x squared minus y squared, you'll

267
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,000
get exactly the same result. And you should check that.

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,007
If you carry through the signs consistently,

269
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:17,840
you'll find that, when you eliminate lambda,

270
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,910
everything goes through exactly the same.

271
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,000
But it's also true that there are different ways

272
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,970
to write the constraint, and any of them would work.

273
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,650
So, for example, if I want x squared

274
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,960
plus y squared to equal 1, I could

275
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,820
take x squared plus y squared to the fourth power equal to 1.

276
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,890
Or I could take x squared plus y squared minus 1

277
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,150
to the 12th power.

278
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,000
Anything that imposes the constraint is going to work.

279
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,340
The idea is the coefficient of lambda,

280
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,910
when we have found our constrained solution,

281
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,860
the coefficient of lambda will vanish.

282
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,000
It vanishes only-- it will vanish on the solution.

283
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,538
There might be other roots to the equation that might be off

284
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:57,830
somewhere in the complex plane.

285
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,330
We're not going to worry about this,

286
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,370
but it is the case that, if it's a solution,

287
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,350
then the coefficient of lambda will vanish.

288
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,650
So this is another easy algebraic equation.

289
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,670
We take derivatives.

290
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,158
We'll have some simple linear equations to solve.

291
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:11,450
Why don't you go ahead and try?

292
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,800
Pause the video here.

293
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,630
Come back, and we'll take a look together.

294
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:22,210


295
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,320
Last chance.

296
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,210
OK, let's take a look.

297
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,040
So we do partials.

298
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,250
So let's look at our partials of L. We have

299
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,950
16x plus 12y minus 2 lambda.

300
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,720
Notice that everything now, compared

301
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,855
to the previous example, is linear in x and y.

302
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:42,780
That last term is always linear in lambda.

303
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,610
I take the partial with respect to y.

304
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,130
And I have terms also in x and y--

305
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,600
12x plus 34y minus 2 lambda y equals 0.

306
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,700
And I have the constraint, which is

307
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,850
just x squared plus y squared has to be equal to 1.

308
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,110
So this has to be satisfied here.

309
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,570
So we've got these equations.

310
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,750
We can solve them for x and y and eliminate lambda.

311
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,610
We can eliminate lambda immediately

312
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,590
by taking the difference of these equations,

313
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,140
solve for x relative to y, and then get

314
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,750
the exact values for x and y in the unit circle

315
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,170
by solving this equation.

316
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,190
And what we find our two solutions, x and y,

317
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,510
are in the direction 1, 2--

318
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,790
and I've normalized this to be on the unit circle--

319
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,980
and in the direction minus 2, 1.

320
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,250
And, interestingly, those are, in normalized form,

321
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,580
the eigenvectors of the quadratic form that's

322
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,930
defined by the matrix, which we could have

323
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:45,610
written as Q is 8, 6, 6, 17.

324
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,780
So, if you compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors

325
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,930
for this, you'll find 12 and 5 for the eigenvalues

326
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,050
and eigenvectors 1, 2 and minus 2, 5.

327
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,670
And, if we normalize the eigenvectors

328
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,490
to be of unit length, we get exactly the results shown here.

329
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,000
