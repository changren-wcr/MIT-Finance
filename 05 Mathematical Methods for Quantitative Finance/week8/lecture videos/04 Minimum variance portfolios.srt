1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,320
PROFESSOR: Here's our first portfolio problem.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,880
Let's find a minimum-variance portfolio.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,130
So let's set up our Lagrange function as follows.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,560
Let's take a look at a Lagrange function

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,410
that depends on a vector of weights.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,600
And the function that I'd like to minimize

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,890
would be the variance.

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,870
And the variance, as we've seen, is given by w

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,735
transpose time the covariance matrix times w.

10
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:25,570
I'm throwing a 1/2 in front just to make it a little bit easier

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,000
when I take derivatives of a quadratic function

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,690
because I care more about the location of the extrema

13
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,250
than I do about the value of the Lagrange function.

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,610
So, if this is minimized, one half of it

15
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,870
is also minimized as well.

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,540
Over here, I have my constraint.

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,130
And, by the way, l is completely arbitrary.

18
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,970
So, if I divide it by 1/2 or multiply it by 3,

19
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,920
it's not going to change anything either.

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,540
The definition of this is arbitrary,

21
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,370
but, once we pick a definition for l, we need to leave it.

22
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,170
So here I've written in vector form the constraint

23
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,060
that these weights need to add up to 1.

24
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,470
And I've done this with a particular construction, which

25
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,480
is a little unfortunate in my opinion,

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,055
but it's in the literature in various places.

27
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:08,680
So I'm going to stick to this so you'll

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,030
recognize it if you see it.

29
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,370
We're going to use the Greek letter iota,

30
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,830
which looks like an i missing its dot,

31
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,260
to represent a vector of 1's.

32
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,750
So it's just 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 for the number of assets

33
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,200
I have, whether it's 2 or 30 or 500, OK?

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,480
So iota represents a vector of 1's.

35
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,850
And, of course, if I take its transpose,

36
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,350
it becomes a row vector.

37
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,540
And the row vector of 1's times a column vector of w1, w2, w3

38
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,260
just gives me the sum of the weights.

39
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,660
So the sum of the weights is given by iota transpose w.

40
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,150
And that needs to be equal to 1.

41
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,940
So I've written the constraint in this form times the Lagrange

42
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,900
multiplier.

43
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,210
Remember, we expect the Lagrange multiplier method

44
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,510
in any number of dimensions to enforce the constraint.

45
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,270
The equation of the partial with respect to l

46
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,570
is equal to 0 is going to tell us the constraint needs

47
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,810
to be satisfied.

48
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,350
So l is my Lagrange multiplier.

49
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,890
Iota is a constant.

50
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,350
It's just a vector of 1's.

51
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,660
And C is the covariance matrix, which

52
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,430
we're assuming to be given.

53
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,500
So this is an interesting idea.

54
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,120
We want to solve the minimum-variance portfolio.

55
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,500
And why do we need a constraint?

56
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,170
Well, if we didn't have the constraint,

57
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,702
the minimum variance would be don't invest.

58
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:22,660
If you keep all your money under your mattress,

59
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,010
there's no risk at all.

60
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,320
You'd definitely have minimum variance.

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,970
Now, you might ask, why would you

62
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,790
want to find the minimum-variance portfolio?

63
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,900
It sounds useful, but this is all about risk and nothing

64
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,080
about return.

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,020
So, if there were no return on these assets,

66
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,750
it's not at all clear why you would

67
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,210
want to have a minimum-variance portfolio.

68
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,070
Why are you investing if there's no benefit

69
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,520
for taking this risk?

70
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,940
If you are forced to invest and you're

71
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,170
forced to have your weight vector fully deployed

72
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,450
in risky assets, then this will be

73
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,190
the minimum-variance portfolio.

74
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,050
But this isn't just a mathematical thing.

75
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,240
People do this, and there are funds

76
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,910
that trade based on this idea of minimum variance.

77
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,050
Why do they do it?

78
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,630
Well, one idea is that we're leaving out the return.

79
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,870
So we could say, well, people obviously

80
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,670
expect to earn a return.

81
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,580
What assumption implicitly about returns

82
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,140
would lead to this case?

83
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,640
One of them would be, if you thought

84
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,460
the average return on assets was 0,

85
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,590
then maybe you shouldn't be investing at all.

86
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,660
Another case would be where you thought that you

87
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,890
couldn't tell anything.

88
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,080
You thought that they're positive on average,

89
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,540
but you don't have any skill in predicting them.

90
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,340
That would at least be coherent.

91
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,790
And, finally, you might say, well,

92
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,390
I do have an estimate for the expected returns,

93
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,330
but I'm going to make the same estimate for all the returns.

94
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,843
And, in that case, this comes out just as a special case.

95
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:45,760
But let's just take it as given and look at it

96
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,050
as a mathematical exercise for a moment.

97
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,390
So we have a constraint.

98
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,190
We need to be fully invested.

99
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,380
The sum of the w's needs to be equal to 1.

100
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,870
Subject to that constraint, given

101
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,360
a set of variances and covariances,

102
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,580
how do we find the portfolio that has minimum variance?

103
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,700
Remember, this is in a very high-dimensional vector space.

104
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,960
So w could be 500 components if we're in the S&P 500.

105
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,670
It could have thousands of components

106
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,920
if we're in the US markets.

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,795
It could have tens of thousands of components

108
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,440
if we're in global markets.

109
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,769
So, in this very, very high-dimensional space,

110
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,310
we're looking for this.

111
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,730
So, for any given vector, we plug it in,

112
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,680
and we get a number for the variance.

113
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,860
And we have this single number that we need to extremize.

114
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,630
We want to find the minimum value

115
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,480
over all of the possible vectors in this very

116
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,970
large-dimensional space.

117
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,900
Let's go.

118
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,660
So what we'd like to do is differentiate with respect

119
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,170
to each of the variables, each of the w sub i's.

120
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,130
So, for each component, we take a partial derivative,

121
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,790
and we set it equal to 0, plus we have one partial derivative

122
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,247
that we set equal to 0 through the Lagrange multiplier.

123
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:54,580
And, if you'd like, you can write this out in components

124
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,510
and do it as well.

125
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,020
Now, as we vary the weights, remember

126
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,740
that we have a quadratic form in the weights w.

127
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,720
So, as I vary the weights with respect

128
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,540
to a particular w sub i, I'm going

129
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,730
to have a whole bunch of terms, depending

130
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,650
on all the cross terms and the diagonal terms itself.

131
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,070
So, if I vary with respect to, say, w1,

132
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,040
I'm going to have C1,1, but I'm also going to have C1,2 times

133
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,730
w2 and C1,3 times w3 and all possible combinations.

134
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,115
So I can write this as a sum over all values j

135
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:32,622
in the portfolio times the matrix element Cij wj minus l.

136
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,580
And I'm going to write this in matrix notation.

137
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,250
Even though, iota, they're all 1's, I'm

138
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,220
going to write it as iota sub i.

139
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,540
And the reason is that then I can write this--

140
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,210
I can recognize this as being a vector equation.

141
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,510
So this right-hand side is the same

142
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,790
as the component of the equation that

143
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,790
says that C acting on the vector w

144
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:02,840
is equal to the vector iota times l.

145
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,960
So how do I solve that?

146
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,690
Let's just multiply in the left and right sides by C inverse.

147
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,630
And we get this solution here.

148
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,010
w is C inverse times iota times some constant l.

149
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,920
In fact, right now, we know almost all we need to know.

150
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,160
We know that the weights are proportional to the inverse

151
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,940
covariance matrix times the vector of 1's.

152
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,790
So, to fix the proportionality constant,

153
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,980
well, we can do it the fancy way.

154
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,370
We can take i transpose and multiply it on the left,

155
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,110
a row vector times w.

156
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,760
That gives us l time iota transpose C inverse iota.

157
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,320
And set that equal to 1.

158
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,520
And solve for it.

159
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,547
So l is going to be 1 over iota transpose C inverse iota.

160
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:51,130
These things, these expressions, we'll see a few more of them.

161
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,993
They look complicated, but, keep in mind,

162
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:54,160
they're really just scalars.

163
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,242
They're just numbers.

164
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:56,950
So they don't have any variables in them.

165
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,580
It's row vector times a square matrix times a column vector,

166
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,830
so a symmetric matrix also.

167
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,840
So these are just numbers.

168
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,650
So we've got a solution so that the w

169
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,450
for the minimum-variance portfolio

170
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,938
is going to be C inverse iota divided by this constant.

171
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:15,730
And now we can see what this constant does.

172
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,980
We really just divided by the sum of the weights.

173
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,300
And that means that the weights add up to 1.

174
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,030
And you can see that because, if you

175
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,860
act on this expression on the left by an iota transpose,

176
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,570
the numerator and denominator become the same.

177
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,610
And we get that it's equal to 1.

178
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,730
What does that mean in financial terms?

179
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,740
Well, consider a special case where the covariance matrix

180
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,000
is diagonal.

181
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,070
So suppose that all the assets are independent of each other,

182
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,470
but they each have their own variance.

183
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,260
So the covariance matrix in that case

184
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,060
has the variances down the diagonal,

185
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,470
sigma 1 squared, sigma 2 squared, sigma 3 squared,

186
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,160
and so on.

187
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,290
And, in this case, C inverse times iota

188
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,290
tells us that all of the weights in the minimum-variance

189
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,950
portfolio are going to be proportional to 1

190
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,370
over the variance.

191
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:21,140
So, special case, Cij diagonal, and we

192
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:28,370
get that wi is proportional to 1 over sigma i squared.

193
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,990
What that says is something actually

194
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,200
that's kind of reasonable.

195
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,620
That is that the riskier an asset is,

196
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,650
the larger its sigma squared is, the less weight I

197
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,580
should have in the portfolio.

198
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,080
So we might have typically thought, in capital terms,

199
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,960
of an equal-weighted portfolio as being

200
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,090
equal capital associated with each of the assets.

201
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,420
But, if the assets have different levels of riskiness

202
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,790
and especially if we're not considering return,

203
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,860
then we might want to think about things

204
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,670
from a risk perspective.

205
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,180
And, instead of allocating equal capital,

206
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,520
we might want to allocate equal risk.

207
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,940
That is the risk is a measure of how much we might gain or lose.

208
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,910
So putting equal amounts of capital on a very risky

209
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,090
and a very low-risk asset are quite different activities.

210
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,790
Under this solution for the global minimum-variance

211
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,000
portfolio, under the special case where the assets are

212
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,970
uncorrelated, qualitatively, what this solution is telling

213
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,360
us is adjust your exposures to equalize

214
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,900
the risk exposure, rather than the capital exposure,

215
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,338
in the different assets.

216
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:31,130
Let's take a look at one numerical example.

217
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,610


218
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,070
So here's a numerical example of the minimum-variance solution.

219
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,590
I've taken from CRSP, which is a research

220
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:47,630
database of historical equity returns, a set of about

221
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,450
700 stocks over a period of many years.

222
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,720
I've estimated the covariance matrix from historical data.

223
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,645
And I've put it in R to compute the quantities

224
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:58,400
that we wrote down before.

225
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,050
In R, the function solve is to invert a matrix

226
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,320
because it's thinking of solving systems of linear equations.

227
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,620
And matrix operations are sandwiched

228
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,800
between percent signs.

229
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,560
So percent star percent means do matrix multiplication.

230
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,380
And a t of a vector means take its transpose.

231
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,450
So this is just, in R speak, implementing what

232
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,100
we had before in our data set.

233
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,600
And what we find is we get a vector.

234
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,950
We got a 690-component vector whose components sum to 1

235
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,560
that tells us where the minimum-variance solution is.

236
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,790
Notice something interesting.

237
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,160
I've ordered them from smallest to biggest.

238
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,460
690, there's no natural ordering amongst stocks,

239
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,740
but I can order them according to the weights

240
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,010
in this solution.

241
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,910
And what I find is some of them are negative, and some of them

242
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,910
are positive.

243
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,650
So the minimum-variance solution is a long-short portfolio.

244
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,340
The weights add up to 1, but that's a net weight, not

245
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,120
the gross weight.

246
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,330
Some of the weights over here are negative numbers

247
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,950
because I didn't constrain them.

248
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,790
I didn't need to--

249
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,950
I didn't say that they had to be positive values.

250
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,860
So, if you were interested in implementing

251
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,330
this in this case--

252
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,310
and this is not atypical-- you would

253
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,177
have to hold short positions.

254
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:13,260
What about an upper bound?

255
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,960
Well, I didn't hit anything equal to or greater than 1.

256
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,110
The largest value I have looks like it's about 3 and 1/2%

257
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,880
in any one asset.

258
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,450
I'm not evenly balanced.

259
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,890
I have about 300 stocks short, about 400 stocks long.

260
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,890
But it does satisfy my constraints.

261
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,260
It is the minimum-variance portfolio

262
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,350
for this particular covariance matrix that we have.

263
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,830
And the solution requires, in this case,

264
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,430
that the w's, which were only constrained by the budget,

265
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,500
involve both positive and negative values.

266
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,000
