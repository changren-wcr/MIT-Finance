1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,670
PROFESSOR: OK, now, let's include return.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,550
After all, that's what most investors are interested in.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,150
We'd like to take some risk in order to earn some return.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,390
So how much return can we get?

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,690
How little risk?

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,440
And is there any limit to what's feasible?

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,080
What's the best that we could do if we

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,790
were willing to look at different classes

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,473
of trade-offs?

10
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:22,890
So what we're going to do is we're

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,220
going to find a solution that will tell us

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,350
all possible portfolios that we could

13
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,870
get with different combinations of risk and return.

14
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,530
Now, from the foundations of finance

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,113
and from maybe common sense, there

16
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:37,530
are a couple of things that we all

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,220
ought to be able to agree on.

18
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,970
And that is that, if we're rational investors,

19
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,220
anyone taking a given level of risk

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,220
should prefer more return to less return.

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,320
And, for a given level of return,

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,220
investors should prefer to have less risk rather than more

23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,150
risk.

24
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,750
But what we don't have any universal solution to

25
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,570
is trade-offs where we need to take

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,190
extra risk to get extra return.

27
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,120
So let's see what we can solve simply in terms of the things

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,710
that we know are required.

29
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,120
So let's generalize our Lagrange function that we did from

30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,700
our minimum-variance case to include--

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,970
in addition to our variance that we want to minimize,

32
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,250
our budget that we want to constrain,

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,110
let's also have a constraint on the return.

34
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,270
So let's set the portfolio to have a certain required

35
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,450
level of return.

36
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,380
So think of mu p as being a constant that we fix.

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,830
I'd like my portfolio to have 6% annualized return

38
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,313
or 10% annualized return.

39
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:38,730
So the question we're going to ask

40
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,490
is, for a given level of return that we're

41
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,190
demanding, what is the portfolio that

42
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,810
has the least amount of risk?

43
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,730
That's something that we should all agree,

44
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,670
for this constrained problem, would be a good thing.

45
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,310
Of all the portfolios that have the given return,

46
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,140
we should all want to hold the one that

47
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,720
has the least amount of risk.

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,290
Now, this isn't the unique formulation of the problem,

49
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,630
but this is the one that's got the easiest mathematics.

50
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,440
So, in the structure of the problem,

51
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,740
we've added one extra term to our previous example.

52
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,960
Because we have two constraints, we

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,160
have to Lagrange multipliers, now called l and m.

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,460
The structure still is quadratic in the variance.

55
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,830
It's linear in w and the constraints.

56
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,330
And the solution is going to look very similar.

57
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,960
There's just a little bit more algebra to eliminate

58
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,570
two Lagrange multipliers instead of one.

59
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,840


60
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,570
We vary the weights, as we did before,

61
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,090
by taking the partial derivatives with respect

62
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,860
to each of the components or each

63
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,700
of the weights in our portfolio.

64
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,490
So the partial of my Lagrange function

65
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,710
with respect to weight wi is going

66
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,530
to be the sum over j of Cij wj.

67
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,610
This is just the i-th component of the matrix product

68
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,050
sigma times the vector w minus Lagrange multiplier l

69
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,965
times the i-th component of the vector of 1's minus

70
00:02:57,965 --> 00:03:01,350
m times the i-th component of the vector

71
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,110
of expected excess returns.

72
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,080
We solve for the weights in exactly the same way.

73
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,780
We have one term that's linear in w,

74
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,730
two that are w independent.

75
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,810
We move those to the right-hand side.

76
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,810
We multiply both sides of the equation by C inverse

77
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,210
because we know that C inverse--

78
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,650
that C is invertible.

79
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,810
And we have our solution that here

80
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,270
is w in terms of C inverse times,

81
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,010
instead of just one thing, two different things.

82
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,750
Now, we'd be done, but we still have these unknown Lagrange

83
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,650
multipliers.

84
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,910
So that's a little annoying.

85
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,990
We don't quite-- we're not quite done yet.

86
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,380
We need to solve for the Lagrange multipliers,

87
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,170
eliminate them, and then see what we can find in terms of w.

88
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,920
And then, finally, we will substitute back in

89
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,900
and see what the variance of the portfolio

90
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,020
is that we can get for the minimum-variance portfolio

91
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,390
as a function now of our selected constrained return, mu

92
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,560
sub p.

93
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,750
So we eliminate the Lagrange multipliers,

94
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,360
as we did before, by solving the constraints.

95
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,570
So the sum of the weights is equal to 1.

96
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,810
If I take i transpose and I multiply it times the equation

97
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,440
above--

98
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,370
hold on one second.

99
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,560
We've got a small problem with our notation.

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,660
The omegas here should be C's.

101
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,209
I will update this in the handouts later on.

102
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,710
I was changing my own notation.

103
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,280
So we'll use C for covariance.

104
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,255
These should be C's.

105
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:30,470


106
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,540
And we're just solving for the constraints.

107
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,370
So the point is I have l here and here.

108
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,290
I have m here and here.

109
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,270
And we want to solve for l and m.

110
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,920
These things in parentheses that we have here,

111
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,220
these are just constants.

112
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,600
So they look like complicated matrix expressions,

113
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,990
but they're just numbers.

114
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,730
So I can write this as a little matrix problem where

115
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:03,340
I can say that I've got some linear combination of l and m

116
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,670
times a matrix with those coefficients I've highlighted

117
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,250
is equal to some constants 1 and mu p.

118
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,110
And then, to solve for l and m, I'm

119
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,100
just going to invert the problem.

120
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,690
So, to be clear, I construct a matrix M that's a 2

121
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,160
by 2 matrix of this form, a, b, b,

122
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,380
c, where a and b are these things now with C's properly

123
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,610
and not omegas.

124
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,820
And I can solve that by taking an inverse, which

125
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,630
is easy to do.

126
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,870
The inverse of this symmetric matrix, of a 2 by 2 matrix,

127
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,010
is easy to take.

128
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,770
And then we can eliminate the Lagrange multipliers

129
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,070
and obtain, finally, the variance

130
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,870
as a function of the return.

131
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,560
So, when we do that, there are two things we've achieved.

132
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,230
One of them is we have an expression for our w's.

133
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,715
And the other is now we have a relationship between sigma,

134
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:54,910
or sigma squared, but between sigma and mu sub

135
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,060
p between risk and return.

136
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,650
So the result is that we get the minimum-variance portfolio

137
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,420
for a given level of return.

138
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,280
And this is actually a hyperbola in space.

139
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,660
So we can write this out in terms of sigma squared

140
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,960
and some bunch of constants.

141
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,918
These are the things that were in that matrix M

142
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:16,160
that I wrote down before.

143
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,510
But it's sigma squared depends on mu p squared minus something

144
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,180
times mu p plus a constant.

145
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,000
When I plot this in terms of mu and sigma,

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,510
I get a hyperbola that's known as the efficient frontier.

147
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,140
And, asymptotically, we can check that this becomes linear,

148
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,750
that these become proportional, because, as mu p goes

149
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,840
to infinity, it dominates the last two terms.

150
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,670
And I'm left with sigma p squared

151
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,320
is proportional to mu p.

152
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,110


153
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,630
In pictures, we get a hyperbola.

154
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,480
And it's conventional to draw things this way,

155
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,940
for historical reasons, where we draw

156
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,640
the standard deviation on the x-axis,

157
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,010
and we draw the return on the y-axis.

158
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,810
So the lines that I've shown in this example,

159
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,450
these are numerical examples from the previous data set,

160
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,560
but taken over two different time periods.

161
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,620
So the red and the blue lines just correspond

162
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,660
to different input data sets.

163
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,980
What we see in both cases is this shape, this hyperbola.

164
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,120
And the idea is that every point along the hyperbola

165
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,060
is a solution to our equation for a given level of return.

166
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,760
So, if I were looking for a return

167
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,780
at this level in these units, I would move across.

168
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,290
And I would say that anything to the left of this point

169
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,550
is not feasible.

170
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,040
Anything to the right is, but it's not desirable.

171
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,580
So all of the points over here are

172
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,120
portfolios that have the same return, but higher risk.

173
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,770
Of all the portfolios of this level of return, as I move,

174
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,830
I can go lower and lower and lower, but then this is it.

175
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,900
I can't get lower than this.

176
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,540
And, similarly, pick a different level of return,

177
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,350
and all of these are higher until I get across here.

178
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,330
And that's the minimum-variance portfolio

179
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,110
for a given level of return.

180
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,410
Now, if we think about this in the other direction,

181
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,210
if we think about transposing it,

182
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,270
if we say, for a given level of risk,

183
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,190
what portfolio would I want, well, I'd

184
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,800
want the portfolio with the highest level of return.

185
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,500
I'm also on the interior region of this curve.

186
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,280
So I would say, these portfolios of this level of risk,

187
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,110
I would want the highest return.

188
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,560
And that would be up here.

189
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,220
Now, you notice that these curves, being hyperbolas,

190
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,720
do turn around.

191
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,840
And these are not functions, strictly speaking,

192
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,230
because there are two values on the curve for values

193
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,640
of a given level of risk.

194
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,980
There are two levels of return.

195
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,200
But the negative ones, the lower part,

196
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,730
is financially uninteresting.

197
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,950
We don't consider it a solution to the problem.

198
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,900
For a given level of risk, we know

199
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,810
that everyone is going to pick the upper value rather

200
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,800
than the lower one.

201
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,730
So, typically, we're going to discard everything down here

202
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,080
for the lower portion.

203
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,430
And the part that matters is this interior region

204
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,240
inside the curve.

205
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,570
Now, the problem we've solved is a single-period optimization

206
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,290
problem.

207
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,690
We've assumed that everything is stationary.

208
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,300
We've assumed that our covariance matrix, which we've

209
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,350
estimated from historical returns, is both accurate

210
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,240
and unchanging over time.

211
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,330
If those things aren't true, then the results change.

212
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,580
So, over a 10-year period, you might not be surprised

213
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,250
that, in a different 10-year period,

214
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,130
the realized covariance is going to be different.

215
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,880
And, perhaps, the past decade of realized covariance

216
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,000
might not be the best predictor for the next 10 years

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,030
of realized covariance, but it is a common starting point

218
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,790
to do.

219
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,690
But, clearly, for our optimization problem,

220
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,830
we've taken as one of the inputs a view as

221
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,860
to what the future covariance matrix should be.

222
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,100
If we change that input, we're going to change the output.

223
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,350
The efficient frontier is going to move.

224
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,680
Similarly, for our estimates of expected return,

225
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,380
if we change them, if they're historical estimates

226
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,010
and we either need to update them because of changing market

227
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,550
conditions or, simply, we believe market conditions are

228
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,650
the same, but we've taken a different data set

229
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,320
to estimate them, if the inputs change,

230
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,820
the outputs will change.

231
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,090
One of the challenges for applications in the real world

232
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,580
is that these changes typically are not negligible.

233
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,290
They're often very, very big.

234
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,900
And, furthermore, the results can

235
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,290
be extremely sensitive to very small changes

236
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,640
in some of the inputs.

237
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,370
So it does raise questions about the stability of the result,

238
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,450
as well as relying on important and difficult

239
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,210
statistical challenges like how to best estimate

240
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,130
the parameters.

241
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,328
Algebraically, though, we do have a clear notion

242
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:46,870
that's worth keeping in mind, despite

243
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,430
the practical difficulties.

244
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,530
There is a feasible set.

245
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,620
And there is-- even if we can't accurately find it,

246
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,230
there is something that's the best portfolio, that

247
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,720
has the best return for a given risk.

248
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,420
And, furthermore, we can map out where it is and divide the risk

249
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,290
return space into those portfolios that are achievable

250
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,430
and those that aren't.

251
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,130
Remember that we started from a very high-dimensional vector

252
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,190
space of possible portfolios where we've got

253
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,990
one component for every asset.

254
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,080
And we're plotting all of those high-dimensional portfolios

255
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,390
on a single two-dimensional plot.

256
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,187
That picture isn't easily invertible,

257
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:25,270
at least not in your head.

258
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,020
That is two neighboring points, two points that

259
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,990
appear to be close on this plot, might be very, very different

260
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,130
portfolios.

261
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,460
We don't know that.

262
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,080
So we might ask, how do we move toward the efficient frontier?

263
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,340
Are we close even if we're not exactly on it?

264
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,930
Those would be good things to know.

265
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,000
One thing that is interesting, though,

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,430
the immediate consequence of our solution,

267
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,170
is that everything that's strictly

268
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,870
on the portfolio-- on the efficient frontier

269
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,220
has a very simple algebraic description.

270
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,430
We wrote down that, before we eliminated our Lagrange

271
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,690
multipliers, that w was C inverse acting

272
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,030
on a linear combination of two vectors,

273
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,660
the iota vector of 1's and the vector of excess returns.

274
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,230
And what that means is that these, C inverse on iota

275
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,310
and C inverse acting on mu, are two very special portfolios.

276
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,330
It says that every portfolio on the efficient frontier,

277
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,410
every portfolio that has an optimal trade-off of risk

278
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,780
and return, is a linear combination

279
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,770
of two special portfolios called characteristic portfolios that

280
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,190
are given with weights that are given by the Lagrange

281
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,150
multipliers.

282
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,980
And there's financial interpretation

283
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,540
of those two portfolios.

284
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,630
C inverse acting on iota, as we've seen,

285
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,970
is the global minimum-variance portfolio.

286
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,970
It's the portfolio we would get if we minimized risk

287
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,070
without regard to return.

288
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,400
The second portfolio, the one with respect to mu,

289
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,010
is the portfolio of the maximum Sharpe ratio.

290
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,010
And, by taking linear combinations of those two,

291
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,030
we sweep out that entire curve.

292
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,219
