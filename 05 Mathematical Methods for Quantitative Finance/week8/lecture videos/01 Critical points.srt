1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,200
PROFESSOR: In optimization, critical points

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,240
are often critical.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,060
We have a function that may be a scalar

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,880
function of multiple variables.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,010
We'd like to find its largest value in one

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,720
of the necessary conditions.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,590
It may be that the partial derivatives with respect

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,000
to the variables vanish.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,650
We also need to check possible boundary terms.

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,930
So let's take a look at critical points or continuous functions,

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,950
multiple variables, and see how we can classify them,

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,620
so we can keep that in mind as we

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,990
look at financial applications.

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,850
For a function of a single variable,

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,690
critical points are places where the first derivative vanishes.

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,120
Consider the Taylor expansion for a continuous function.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,510
I have f of x expanding around a point x0,

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,600
and I have a linear term times the first derivative

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,100
plus a quadratic times the second derivative

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,990
evaluated at a point and so on for higher term.

21
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,440
Now, if the first derivative varnishes,

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,150
then I have the special result. If I move the f of x0

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,070
to the other side, I have that the amount

24
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,820
by which f differs from the value at point f0

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,080
is a parabola.

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,460
It looks like a quadratic term in the vicinity of x0

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,310
when x minus x0 is small and the higher order

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,500
terms x minus x0 cubed, to the fourth,

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
and so on are small compared to the term that we keep.

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,650
Now, we need to check that the second derivative, in fact,

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,730
is not vanishing.

32
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,290
For the generic case, it will be.

33
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,230
If it vanishes, then we go to the next higher order term.

34
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,770
This is typical unless there's either a very accidental reason

35
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,890
why it vanishes where there's a particular symmetry.

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,000
Now, in higher dimensions this parabola,

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,820
which might be concave or convex depending

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,760
on the sign of f double prime, is

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,540
described by a quadratic form.

40
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,080
It's described by the matrix of second partial derivatives.

41
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,320
So for a function of several variables,

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,280
Taylor's theorem tells us that for a scalar function

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,509
in the neighborhood of a vector point, a fixed point x0,

44
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,220
that we can do an expansion.

45
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,000
f of x is being the gradient of f

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,560
times the difference between x and x0 as a vector quantity.

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,450
That's a leading order term plus a second-order term

48
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,150
plus cubic terms and so on.

49
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,640
And the second-order term is of particular interest.

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,610
It's a vector, this difference vector x minus x0

51
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,960
transpose times Q times the same vector on the right-hand side

52
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,790
with a 1/2 in front.

53
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,910
And this Q defines a quadratic form.

54
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,880
This is just a matrix of second partial derivatives.

55
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,460
You can write it out in terms of components if you'd like.

56
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,250
And f is the gradient function, and this

57
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,510
varnishes at a critical point.

58
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,360
So when the gradient of f vanishes,

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,610
which means that all of the first derivatives

60
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,770
vanish, not just one of them or two of them--

61
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,840
when they all vanish and when x minus x0 is small in magnitude,

62
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,050
then we can approximate the deviation of the function

63
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,080
from a particular point by this quadratic behavior.

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,340
So this quadratic behavior, as in the single-variable case,

65
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,480
is somewhat universal.

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,500
It's worth studying because every function, unless Q

67
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,650
vanishes for some particular reason,

68
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,050
is going to have this form when we're sufficiently

69
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,340
close in the neighborhood.

70
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,530
So there are more possibilities than two,

71
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,420
just the two signs of f double prime

72
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,670
in the single-variable case, and we can take a look

73
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,840
at how they're classified.

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,450


75
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,650
The eigenvalues determine the type of critical point we have.

76
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,900
If the eigenvalues of Q are all positive,

77
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,530
the function is convex up and then the critical point

78
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,490
is a minimum.

79
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,200
If the eigenvalues of Q are all negative,

80
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,000
the function is concave and the critical point is the maximum.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,920
If Q has both positive and negative values,

82
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,530
then it's called a saddle point.

83
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,080
There are some maximum in one direction.

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,100
It's a minimum in some other direction.

85
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,400
And if any of the eigenvalues are 0,

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,100
they define flat directions where the function is neither

87
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,910
increasing or decreasing.

88
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,540
Now, the reason we talk about the eigenvalues

89
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,420
is because the eigenvectors determine,

90
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,930
really, the axes of orientation, and the eigenvalues

91
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,660
tell us how things vary along those directions.

92
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,850
Because Q is a symmetric matrix--

93
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,550
remember, the order of partial derivatives doesn't matter--

94
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,980
the eigenvectors are going to be orthogonal.

95
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,970
So the general cases we might get

96
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,520
with all kinds of mixed partials really

97
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,220
are set of cases if we think of diagonalizing

98
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,450
and having orthogonal indices--

99
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,640
or excuse me, and having orthogonal axes, then

100
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,840
the eigenvalues whether they're positive or negative

101
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,430
along different directions tell us

102
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,080
whether in that particular direction

103
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,420
along that particular axis the shape of the curve

104
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,720
is like a parabola, it's convex up, convex down,

105
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,240
or if it's a flat direction.

106
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,640
We can take a look at a few examples.

107
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,070
So let's look at a few examples of functions of two variables.

108
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,070
So I can plot them on the screen in projected three dimensions.

109
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,960
Let's consider a function f.

110
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
It's a function of x and y.

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,000
So for example, suppose I have this function. f of xy

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,400
is x times e to the minus x squared plus y squared.

113
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,430
And I think of z, the z-coordinate,

114
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,680
as being the height of this plot,

115
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,810
and this is one way, a prospective plot.

116
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,080
And I've given you code in R so that you can run this and get

117
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,610
this pretty picture yourself.

118
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,290
But where do we see critical points?

119
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,060
Well, the critical points that we see

120
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,210
are local maximum here, a local minimum here.

121
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,660
And in fact, if this is what we've got,

122
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,770
these are global max and global min as well.

123
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,710
They're places where the first derivatives vanish.

124
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,520
We can also visualize this in terms of a contour plot, where

125
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,350
we see-- in a contour plot, we see

126
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,980
lines of constant value of f drawn together.

127
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,500
We notice-- now, of course, contour lines

128
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,860
never cross because we can't have two different values

129
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,035
at the same place.

130
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,410
But we can see over here, there's

131
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,400
a height scale on the right-hand side.

132
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,700
So white is high.

133
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,600
Black is low.

134
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,700
But otherwise, you see an interesting symmetry

135
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,750
on the left and right parts of the graph.

136
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,400
So here's a function that typifies

137
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,430
the kind of classic example where we have a minimum value.

138
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,440
This is just instead of a parabola, it's circular.

139
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,730
It's a paraboloid.

140
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,060
x squared plus y squared, so the minimum value is obviously

141
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,965
the origin where its value is 0 and everywhere else it's

142
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:41,465
greater.

143
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:45,870


144
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,520
Here's a 3D plot.

145
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,510
We noticed that with this particular description,

146
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,970
the function is rotationally symmetric.

147
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,800
If I'd put in different coefficients for x and y,

148
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,610
then the axes would have-- the circles

149
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,080
would have been ellipses.

150
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,870
And if it had been those axes were then rotated along

151
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,910
some other direction, the quadratic form

152
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,000
might have a cross term as well, a term in xy.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,568
But geometrically, it's the same idea of what's going on.

154
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:12,610
There's a single minimum.

155
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,960
There's some contours around it.

156
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,470
This is an example of the function,

157
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,690
which has a saddle point.

158
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,960
Here, I have f of x is x squared minus 4y squared.

159
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,010
So you notice that not only is the sign of the x term

160
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,050
and the y term different, but the coefficient

161
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,430
is as well so that the speed of change or the rate of curvature

162
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,750
can be different in the two different directions.

163
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,980
So if I move along the x direction, I'm increasing.

164
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:43,200
If I move along the y direction for the origin, I'm decreasing.

165
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,870
Here's a contour plot of the same thing.

166
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:55,720
Now here's an interesting case where we have a flat direction,

167
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,620
and we also have a mistake in the equation.

168
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,060
So that should just be f of x equals--

169
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,100
f of x and y equals y squared.

170
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,520
So you notice that because there's no y dependence,

171
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,350
the function has a symmetry.

172
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,760
I can translate in y.

173
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,230
I can take any value.

174
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,930
And that means that as I move in the y direction,

175
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,100
not only is the direction flat, but every cross section,

176
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,550
the x dependence at any given point y in that valley,

177
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,150
is exactly the same.

178
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,350
So this is an example where we have a flat direction,

179
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,460
and it's due to asymmetry in the problem.

180
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,880
And in this case, one of the eigenvalues

181
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,909
of our quadratic form Q, our matrix of second derivatives,

182
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,580
is going to be 0.

183
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,880
This is a case where, like the other one,

184
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,880
I have a flat direction along the y equal 0.

185
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,850
But unlike the other one, it's not symmetric.

186
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,860
It's not translationally symmetric.

187
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,980
And you can see that as I move along the y-axis

188
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,620
for different values of y, the cross section,

189
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,650
the cross-sectional curvature, as I move in the x direction

190
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,620
changes.

191
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,190
So in one perpendicular direction, I'm completely flat.

192
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,980
But in the other direction, there

193
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,460
are changes that are seen once I move in the perpendicular

194
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,770
direction.

195
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,500
And here's a picture of the same thing shown as a contour plot.

196
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,000
