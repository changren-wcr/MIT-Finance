1
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:02,590
PROFESSOR: The results we've looked at

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,520
can be generalized in two ways.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,440
One of them is by including more linear constraints of the kind

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,280
we had, and that's easy.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,250
We add more Lagrange multipliers.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,620
So we might have a rule that in addition

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,290
to a return constraint and a budget constraint,

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,890
we might want to limit certain risk exposures.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,690
We might want to limit the portfolio

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,080
data, which is its sensitivity to the overall market.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,140
We might want to target a particular industry exposure

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,570
or foreign country exposure, or we

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,070
might want to neutralize them.

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,050
If we're allowing a long-short portfolio,

15
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,770
we might say that our net exposure to a given country

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,110
should be equal to 0.

17
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,050
So in all those cases, we just had one more Lagrange

18
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,260
multiplier, and we solve the same thing.

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,040
It's just the algebra gets a little bit more complex.

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,750
Another kind of constraint that's

21
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,770
important in investment management

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,210
and many practical problems are inequality constraints,

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,000
and the Lagrange multiplayer method will not handle these.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,690
In this case, we need to proceed with numerical solutions

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,570
and a technique called quadratic programming.

26
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,880
The idea of inequality constraint

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,673
is we might want, for example as I hinted before, we might have

28
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:16,840
a mandate where we're not allowed to short positions

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,940
and we need all our w's to be equal to 0.

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,150
The Lagrange multiplier method has no guarantee

31
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,480
that the solutions will end up with positive values of w.

32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,490
They could be anywhere in the vector space

33
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,480
and not in half the vector space or a quadrant of the vector

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,240
space where all the w's are positive.

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,790
And we might have a constraint on an upper bound.

36
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,530
We might not be allowed to use leverage,

37
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,840
which would say that the individual weights all

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,790
need to be less than 1.

39
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,840
We might have more binding or tighter constraints,

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,940
where a typical investment manager isn't allowed

41
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,370
to put all of his or her eggs in one basket

42
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,790
or even a lot of them.

43
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,450
There might be a rule that says, the weight invested

44
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,650
in a particular asset or asset class can't exceed, say, 5%

45
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,480
or 10% or 1%.

46
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,480
So there might be some limit that's well inside the 0 and 1

47
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,880
range, and it could be applied at the level

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,770
of an individual weight or it could

49
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,830
be applied to a sum portfolio, which would correspond

50
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,280
to some linear combination of weights being constrained

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,810
with some upper or lower bound.

52
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,140
So when we have this kind of thing,

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,140
the Lagrange multiplier method might give us

54
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,450
a method where the constraints are satisfied,

55
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,470
these inequalities.

56
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,560
But it's not guaranteed to do so.

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,850
And in general, we need to use this technique called

58
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,140
quadratic programming.

59
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,060
The quadratic here comes from the fact

60
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,095
that our objective function is quadratic,

61
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:38,470
and our constraints being linear means that we can always

62
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,960
find solutions.

63
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,930
And we're not going to derive this.

64
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,605
We'll have some references for it,

65
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:47,980
and you can take a look if you're

66
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,420
interested in the algorithms.

67
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,150
But you'll find packages for doing this numerically,

68
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,400
and we'll take a look at some numerical examples as well.

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,350
Qualitatively, the important thing

70
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,210
is that we're always going to be by adding extra constraints.

71
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,690
The more constraints we have, the smaller

72
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,500
our efficient frontier becomes, the smaller

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,180
our feasible set of portfolios becomes.

74
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,120
The constraints in the best case are non-binding,

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,710
and then we have no change.

76
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,360
But the constraints can only make things worse.

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,930
They can only remove, if they are binding,

78
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,030
portfolios that otherwise would have been feasible

79
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,660
and have them not be feasible.

80
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,900
So we would expect the feasible space

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,610
to shrink when we solve for the inequality constraints,

82
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,320
and we'd expect the constrained optimization problem to give us

83
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,070
something that's smaller and that is not necessarily

84
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,655
the solution to the original constraint maximization.

85
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,780
Now, there are lots of other investment constraints

86
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,650
we could have--

87
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,550
position size, leverage size, factor exposure,

88
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,763
different balances for long-short neutrality.

89
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:54,180
We could be long-short in weights.

90
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,100
We could be equal beta, long and short.

91
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,977
We could have other factor exposures.

92
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,310
There are many other techniques.

93
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,890
There's a broad variety of them that

94
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,840
can be handled in quadratic programming.

95
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,090
There's a package in R called quadprog

96
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,140
and a function called solve.QP you can take a look at,

97
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,960
and you can take a look at our code examples as well.

98
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,360
What we find is typically something like this.

99
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,420
This is just an example of an asset allocation problem.

100
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,510
Suppose I start with eight assets,

101
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,730
and I've got their means and their covariances.

102
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,210
I have their mu vector, expected excess returns,

103
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,940
and I have their covariance matrix c.

104
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,680
And here are the individual assets

105
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,170
with their individual risk and return.

106
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,080
I haven't plotted what the correlations are among them,

107
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,740
but these are down here.

108
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,760
And if I compute from that mu and sigma what

109
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,730
the unconstrained efficient frontier is,

110
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,280
I find this hyperbola that's shown here on the black line.

111
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,690
So everything that's feasible is on that interior

112
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,040
of the black line.

113
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,590
When we include a long-only constraint

114
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,690
and a no-levergage constraint-- so we'll

115
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,970
have a budget constraint, and we'll

116
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,320
want to maximize our return or minimize the risk for a given

117
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,220
level of return.

118
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,150
And in addition, if we impose that the weights have

119
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,210
to be strictly between--

120
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,610
they have to be greater than or equal to 0 and less than

121
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,650
or equal to 1, they can't be negative,

122
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,970
they can't be greater than 1, they can't be short,

123
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,480
they can't be leverage positions,

124
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,960
then we find the blue line as being the set of solutions.

125
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,900
And this is the efficient frontier,

126
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,050
and the feasible portfolios are the interior region.

127
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,190
So these are the-- everything inside here

128
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,750
is a feasible portfolio, and the points that are optimal

129
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,060
are the points that are on the blue line.

130
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,230
Everything above and to the left on this graph is not reachable.

131
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,160
We cannot get returns that have lower risk for the same level

132
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,730
of return than the ones in our solution to our optimal

133
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,480
equation.

134
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,690
We cannot get returns that have--

135
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,150
portfolios that have higher return for given risk or that

136
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,070
have lower risk for a given return.

137
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,430
That excludes the region above and to the left

138
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,940
of the blue curve.

139
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,860
But we can see what we've lost in applying the constraints

140
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,300
and limiting the weights to be strictly between 0 and 1,

141
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,700
that we've lost the area that's the difference

142
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,973
between the black curve and the blue curve.

143
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:22,390
Those are portfolios that we might

144
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,930
have had that aren't here.

145
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,160
So it's always an interesting idea when to ask,

146
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,940
are constraints binding?

147
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,910
And if the constraints are binding,

148
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,980
what does it cost to have those constraints?

149
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,350
What would happen if we loosen the constraints?

150
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,540
The optimal solution would move.

151
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,710
Where would it move to?

152
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,760
Are we close?

153
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,380
Are we giving up a lot by imposing

154
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,030
these constraints or not?

155
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,010


156
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,590
So we do have these things that are set for constraints.

157
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,230
We typically think about solving and finding

158
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,150
an optimal portfolio, but there are

159
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,130
a couple of things that we might also keep in mind.

160
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,180
One of them is that if you're going

161
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,130
to optimize your portfolio, you're

162
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,780
highly dependent on the inputs.

163
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,300
You might want to know how sensitive your results are

164
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,560
to those inputs.

165
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,870
That is, if you were to change them a little bit,

166
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,940
if you had estimation errors in your returns

167
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,250
or in your covariance matrix, would you

168
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,050
move just a little bit all along the way?

169
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,570
Would you move along the efficient frontier?

170
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,000
Or would you end up somewhere else completely?

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,210
Conversely, even if you're not an optimizer,

172
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,340
you've just got some equal weighted portfolio,

173
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,080
or you're following an index--

174
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,150
you've got some country index--

175
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,240
it's of interest even if you haven't optimized

176
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,290
to ask where your portfolio would lie along this risk

177
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,370
and return plot.

178
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,570
Is it close to the efficient frontier?

179
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,600
And for example, that's an even--

180
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,500
an equal-weighted portfolio with even allocations of capital

181
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,890
to all of the assets.

182
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,070
That's an easy thing to explain to investors.

183
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,790
If you find that it's reasonably close to the frontier anyways,

184
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,090
then you're not sensitive to any of these estimation problems.

185
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,500
That would be good to know.

186
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,450
On the other hand, if you're far away,

187
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,440
now you can use this picture to make a compelling case for why

188
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,740
a careful analysis and constraint optimization

189
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,440
solution for an asset allocation or a general portfolio

190
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,010
optimization problem gives benefit for the investor

191
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,830
in terms of increasing the expected return,

192
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,720
decreasing the expected risk, or both.

193
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,000
