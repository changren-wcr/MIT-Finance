1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,580
PROFESSOR: Now that we have our data, let's optimize.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,610
So let's start with the minimum variance portfolio.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,070
That was the simplest optimization we had.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,950
There's only one constraint, the budget constraint.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,223
So we have a covariance matrix, we have our expected returns

6
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:19,390
which we're going to ignore because they don't enter

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,640
into the problem, and what we'd like

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,210
to do is solve for the minimum variance portfolio.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,180
So if we do that, remember that we had a very simple solution,

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,830
that the minimum variance portfolio is

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,220
proportional to c inverse iota.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,100
So we're going to run this chunk of code here.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,330
And what this does is here's c inverse times iota, and then

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,190
remember that we have it normalized

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,810
so that the weights sum to 1.

16
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,530
One way we could do it was by looking at the--

17
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,880
dividing by transpose iota inverse covariance iota,

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,370
but I like to think of this sometimes in a little bit

19
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,930
more practical terms.

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,970
These are weights.

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,050
They need sum to 1.

22
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,840
So let's sum them and normalize them

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,340
so that they sum to 1 by dividing

24
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,960
by the sum of the raw weights.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,480
So we know that these are proportional first

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,850
to the inverse covariance matrix times iota.

27
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,850
As we said in the special cases like a diagonal covariance

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,700
matrix, it says the exposure is going

29
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,930
to be inversely proportional to the variance, which makes sense

30
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,977
at least qualitatively that the riskier an asset is,

31
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:34,560
the less exposure we're going to have.

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,860
And this is typical of the way that we

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,370
think about risk and portfolio construction,

34
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,590
that the amount of capital we have

35
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,710
isn't actually the first thing we think about.

36
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,163
We often think about how much risk exposure

37
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:49,580
we have because that's going to be

38
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,200
the basis for getting return.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,400
And we're often, in financial institutions, not necessarily

40
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,100
constrained by our budget because we can borrow.

41
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,740
We can use the balance sheet of an organization perhaps.

42
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,380
We still need to be accountable for our capital usage.

43
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,980
But when it comes to looking at potential investments,

44
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,910
we want to make sure that we get a high return per unit of risk,

45
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,850
not just a high return per unit of capital, which would not

46
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,920
distinguish between the return on two investments

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,410
a very different risk.

48
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,030
Now, the other interesting portfolio

49
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,110
we might as well plot while we're here,

50
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,870
which is the portfolio of maximum Sharpe ratio, which

51
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,570
is c inverse times mu.

52
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,510
And what we saw in solving the problem where

53
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,540
we had both a budget constraint and an expected return

54
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,530
constraint was that any portfolio

55
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,280
in the efficient frontier could be written

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,760
as a linear combination of two portfolios,

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,230
sometimes called characteristic portfolios.

58
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,010
One of them was the global minimum variance portfolio,

59
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,350
and it's associated with this particular vector

60
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,770
iota, a vector of 1's that corresponds to the budget

61
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,580
constraint.

62
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,860
The other one is associated with the vector

63
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,230
of expected excess returns, and that's

64
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,680
c inverse mu or it's a portfolio proportional to c inverse mu.

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,810
So by taking linear combinations of those two portfolios,

66
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,510
we can reach everything on the efficient frontier.

67
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,955
So we solve for them.

68
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:11,580
What do we get?

69
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,520
We get a bunch of numbers, and here are the numbers.

70
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,240
So we've got a column vector, and we can look up

71
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,380
which assets are which.

72
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,890
But it's pretty clear that these numbers are unconstrained.

73
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,290
Some of the numbers here are negative.

74
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,070
They correspond to short positions.

75
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,650
Some of them are big.

76
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,480
They correspond to long positions.

77
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,190
Take a look at the bottom two columns that we have here.

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,380
These were the ones of France and Japan,

79
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,400
and this says the optimal thing to do

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,330
is to go short one of them 60%, a huge position,

81
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:50,195
and go long the other one 1.7 and similar kinds of numbers

82
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:50,945
for both of these.

83
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,610
So these are very, very big numbers.

84
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:58,670
They're not the kinds of things a typically prudent asset

85
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,250
allocator would do, even though here they're optimal.

86
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,310
This looks like extremely large positions,

87
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,350
very large short positions, very highly levered long positions.

88
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:15,580


89
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,070
We can also look at a bar plot.

90
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,380
Taking a look just at rank order is often

91
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,050
a helpful overview for a portfolio

92
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,760
just to see where things stand.

93
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,990
And if we look for this portfolio,

94
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,510
you see, say, for the mu portfolio.

95
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,460
You can do the same thing for the iota portfolio.

96
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,200
We see that the weights to go from negative to positive

97
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,950
and that most of the weights in the middle

98
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,470
actually are not going to have as big an influence as two

99
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,060
gigantic weights on the top and the bottom.

100
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,000
