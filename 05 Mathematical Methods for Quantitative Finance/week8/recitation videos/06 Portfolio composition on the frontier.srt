1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,590
PROFESSOR: So this is our traditional risk return

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,190
plot where we have risk on the x-axis, excess return

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,430
on the y-axis, and we can see what's efficient.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,149
We can plot any portfolio on this graph,

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,760
see how far it is from the efficient frontier.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,220
But one thing that we don't have insight into

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,810
is how to reverse the mapping.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,610
After all, the portfolios here are

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,120
in an eight-dimensional space.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,060
What do those portfolios look like?

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,580
What are the portfolios on the efficient frontier?

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,220
The red dots are basis vectors.

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,650
Those are basic vectors, the direction of one

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,060
of the assets projected down to this two-dimensional space.

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,520
Can we see what's going on as we move

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,320
along the efficient frontier?

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,127
Sure we can.

18
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:46,210
We've already solved that.

19
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,560
That was one of the outputs of the optimizer.

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,400
So let's take a look at running the next chunk of code,

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,270
which is down here.

22
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,830
And what we're going to do is let's run this and take a look

23
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,210
at a plot.

24
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:06,080
And what we're doing here is we're looking at a stacked bar

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,373
plot because remember that the weights go between 0 and 1.

26
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:13,415
So when we have short weights, a stacked bar plot

27
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:14,850
is a terrible idea.

28
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,880
But when the weights have to be between 0 and 1,

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,160
it's a terrific idea because they add up to 1,

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,520
and we have a good idea as to what the portfolio balance is.

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,030
So what we're looking at is that as we move along

32
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,050
the efficient frontier from our lowest return

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,470
up to the highest return, we're asking what the portfolio

34
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,150
composition looks like.

35
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,670
What we see on the left-hand side of the picture

36
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,320
is that we start with US bonds.

37
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,480
If you want to have really low risk,

38
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,800
you don't have any choice.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,600
There's just no room in the portfolio.

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,720
For anything risky, it's going to dominate.

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,490
As we start increasing, we get more and more--

42
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,610
we go from the bonds.

43
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,230
Pretty quickly, we go to euros, so we

44
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,790
get a little bit more return.

45
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,220
And that gradually decreases as those

46
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,380
get crowded out as we move our way

47
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,180
along the efficient frontier.

48
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,990
What's growing?

49
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,750
Well, take a look at US assets on the bottom.

50
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,440
They're growing.

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
So look at this again in vertical slices.

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,990
As we move from left to right, we see that the US is growing.

53
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,580
We see that Japan and France and all the countries

54
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,850
are growing in different slices in different wedges.

55
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,310
So as we move up the efficient frontier,

56
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,230
we're having more risky assets, fewer riskless assets.

57
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,340
And the reason we see some common things and these looks

58
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,910
somewhat proportional is precisely because of the nature

59
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,432
that we saw that when we're--

60
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:46,160
that this is driven by certain linear combinations that

61
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,070
work for balancing what the risk and return are,

62
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,410
the kind of thing we saw in the unconstrained case.

63
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,830
But then we hit a turning point.

64
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,080
So as we keep moving up and as the return level gets higher,

65
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,850
we finally need return that we just

66
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,040
can't get except by being completely in the risky assets.

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,300
So when we get up about 80% of the way across this graph,

68
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,930
what we see is there's no more room even for euros,

69
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,530
and we see that the riskiest assets are dominating.

70
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,360
In this case, it's France and Japan

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,880
because those are the two that have the highest return.

72
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,980
So when we're at the far right-hand side of the graph,

73
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,540
we're dominated by return.

74
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,880
We have to invest in the riskiest assets.

75
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,130
Otherwise, there's no way to satisfy the constraint--

76
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,200
or excuse me, not necessarily the riskiest

77
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,825
in the highest return assets.

78
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:36,200
In this case, we have two of them

79
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,840
because they're very, very closely connected

80
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,760
in terms of their risk and return for where they sit.

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,480
So the portfolio is including both of them

82
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,390
instead of taking opposite positions

83
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,260
as it did when the weights were completely unconstrained here.

84
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,030
Because the weights have to be positive,

85
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,420
it's looking for a little bit of correlation offset.

86
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,210
But there we go.

87
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,520
So this is interpolating between the lowest return, lowest risk

88
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,450
side and the highest return side of the efficient frontier.
