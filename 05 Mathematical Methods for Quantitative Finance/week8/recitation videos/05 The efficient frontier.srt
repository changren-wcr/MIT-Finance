1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,420
PROFESSOR: We'll apply it to our global asset allocation

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,440
problem.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,370
And let's pick 100 points, let's say,

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,370
and we're going to run this chunk of code right here.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,210
And we're going to do 100 points on the efficient frontier.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,370
We're going to run our function.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,880
It's the mvef as a function of the covariance,

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,500
the historical expected returns, and our number of points.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,930
We'll put this in an object we'll call big MVEF for lack

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,190
of imagination.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,700
You can plot the results either using the base R plot

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,270
commander.

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,813
Here, I've done it using ggplot to get

14
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:37,980
something that's a little bit more nicely formatted.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,450
And there are a couple other things

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,740
that are nice about ggplot.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,780
One of them is it really respects

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,140
the structure of the data when we've got more complex,

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,400
related data.

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,750
And at the practical level, it lets us layer and add things

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,370
to build more complex plots if we

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,560
want to put several graphs on the same page,

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,110
where the base R command doesn't do that as elegantly.

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,350
So our first command here is we're

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,050
defining this object because we're going to use it again,

26
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,630
mvef.plot.

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,030
The ".plots" is just a naming convention,

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,830
and what we're doing is we're telling it,

29
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,750
plot these xy things and put some labels out there.

30
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,770
So what do we get?

31
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,890
We get something that looks qualitatively

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,480
like the hyperbolas we saw.

33
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,150
There's a curve.

34
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,170
But it's obviously not a hyperbola because it bends.

35
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,990
Instead of going asymptotically straight,

36
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,340
it has a non-conic curve.

37
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,500
It's got a kink in there, and it ends.

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,410
It stops at a point, which is the highest

39
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,290
return in our data set.

40
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,653
And similarly, it stops down here at the bottom.

41
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:42,320
But there it is.

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,130
We've solved.

43
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,660
So these points here represent the portfolios

44
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,270
subject to the constraints that have

45
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,260
the maximum level of return for a given the level of risk.

46
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,170
Or the exact problem that we solved,

47
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,320
they've got the minimum risk for a given level of return.

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,770
Everything in the graph that is below and to the right

49
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,870
is feasible but not optimal.

50
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,300
Everything that is above and to the left

51
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,630
would require violating one of the constraints.

52
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,260
Now, how do we compare this to the unconstrained problem?

53
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,120
Well, let's take a look at that.

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,690
So let's look at running this chunk of code.

55
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,650
Remember that we defined A, B, C to be the numbers that we

56
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,640
did in lecture for looking at the exact problem

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,230
without inequality constraints, so we can do it.

58
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,890
And remember that we solved explicitly

59
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,830
for a function of-- sigma p was a quadratic function of mu sub

60
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,550
p.

61
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,860
So let's solve for this here, and let's

62
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,240
plot the results together.

63
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,010
And that gives us the blue line.

64
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,530
And in addition, I plotted the red dots

65
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,220
are the original assets in our data set.

66
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,390
So what we can see is that blue line is indeed a hyperbola.

67
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,710
We've cut it off at the same upper level of mu sub p,

68
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,550
so it's commensurate so it doesn't run off the page.

69
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,910
We see that there's a region between the blue

70
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,140
and the black lines.

71
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,720
That's what we give up by imposing our constraints.

72
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,300
The things between the blue and the black lines

73
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,690
are risk-return combinations that

74
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,690
are not allowed with our inequality constraints, that

75
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,960
would be allowed, that would not violate a budget constraint,

76
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,790
but they do violate one of the inequality constraints.

77
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,840
So that's the cost of not taking short positions.

78
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,750
That's the cost of not using leverage.

79
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,120
This is the area between the two curves

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,540
is how much more return we could have gotten per unit of risk

81
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,450
or how much risk reduction we could have gotten, particularly

82
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,450
with the short positions, that generate

83
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,110
a synthetic negative correlation, how much less risk

84
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,880
we could have taken for a given level of return.

85
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,600
So the blue line is computed analytically,

86
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,820
and that's our Lagrange multiplier method.

87
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,030
The black line or the black set of dots connected by a curve

88
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,080
through them is the numerical result of quadratic programming

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,290
that we've done by running this algorithm

90
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,967
and running it through the computer.

91
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:07,467
