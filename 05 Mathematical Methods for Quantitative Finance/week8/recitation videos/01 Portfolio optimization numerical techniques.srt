00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,620
PROFESSOR: Take a look at portfolio optimization

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,030
on the computer.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,810
We'll take a look at some data.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,610
We'll run some calculations of the efficient frontier.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,580
And then, we'll compare the different versions

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,580
of constrained optimizations that we've talked about,

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,720
one of them where we use the exact closed form result where

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,450
we have equality constraints and the other using

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,400
techniques of quadratic programming

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,410
when inequality constraints are present.

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,580
So the exact results that are obtained by the Lagrangian

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,860
multiplier method work well if we've

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,230
got a fixed number of equality constraints.

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,500
But a budget constraint might have some risk constraints.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,770
For example, we might want to have a market-neutral portfolio

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,760
where some of the market betas as measured, say, by kappas

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,170
and betas and to 0.

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,740
We might want to set an industry exposure to a particular level.

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,750
But typically, what we're doing is either

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,960
we're targeting an objective like a budget,

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,150
or we're targeting a constraint to manage risk or exposures

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,810
such as a long-short portfolio or with an industry constraint.

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,120
And those work terrifically well because we can

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,590
have any number of constraints.

25
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,800
There's a couple of caveats for the closed form.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,670
Number one, we want to have more assets

27
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,160
or more degrees of freedom than we do constraints.

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,948
And second, the constraints generally

29
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,490
need to be independent of each other.

30
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,085
There can be degenerate cases.

31
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,460
And finally, the constraints need

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,965
to be consistent with each other.

33
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:29,090
It's possible to write down constraints that cannot

34
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,980
simultaneously be satisfied.

35
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,010
But usually, it's a fairly straightforward problem.

36
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,040
Now, when we do that for equality constraints,

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,780
there's nothing that bounds the range

38
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,520
of the weights in the solution.

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,610
They could be anything.

40
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,970
The w's that we get for a portfolio could

41
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,620
be any real number, and that means

42
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,200
they don't lie between 0 and 1 where we typically

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,020
think of the weight of capital allocation within a portfolio.

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,080
Now, we can generalize.

45
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,850
Certainly for negative weights, we

46
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,590
can think of those short positions.

47
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,770
They're effectively the case where a short position as we

48
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,770
sell some securities short and we

49
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,080
require bringing back that number of securities

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,130
to get to 0.

51
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,590
And it functions to a pretty good approximation

52
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,720
as treating it like a negative number.

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,310
What about w bigger than 1?

54
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,960
That's a levered position.

55
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,160
We borrow money.

56
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,970
Usually, we'll assume for financial assumptions we

57
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,480
borrow at the risk-free rate.

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,090
And we can buy more than the amount of capital

59
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,710
that we initially have present.

60
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,730
So that's OK.

61
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,970
But even then, there are practical real-world

62
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,930
limitations.

63
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,550
We could get to a w of 1 and 1/2, a w of 2, a w of 10

64
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,840
if we're highly leveraged.

65
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,270
We can't get to a w of 50 million.

66
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,900
No one's going to give you that much credit or me.

67
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,070
So we do want to know if things lie within a reasonable amount.

68
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,500
And in fact, this is true in general

69
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,030
of constrained problems.

70
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,460
We always want to know for a solution

71
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,800
to a constrained optimization problem,

72
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,480
are the constraints binding?

73
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,430
After all, it could be that we find

74
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,530
a solution that is not pinned at one edge or the other.

75
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,380
In the case of equality constraints,

76
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,010
we force them to bind.

77
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,160
But in the case of inequality constraints,

78
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,680
we might be at a maximum or you might

79
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,390
be somewhere in the interior region

80
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,700
where those constraints don't actually

81
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,950
come into play for the particular values,

82
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,620
the parameters, that we have to work with.

83
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,014
