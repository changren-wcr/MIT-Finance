00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:01,690
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,140
consider a comprehensive multi-asset example in which we

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,290
will build an optimal tangency portfolio,

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,410
compute its Sharpe ratio, and compute

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,140
the return-to-risk ratios of individual assets.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,440
Suppose that there are 10 stocks in the market, the expected

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,230
returns on which follow the following two-factor model.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,720
In this model, parameters are as follows.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,640
b1 equals to 10 for each of the 10 stocks.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,750
b2 equals i, which means that for stock 1,

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,190
this parameter equals to 1.

12
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,220
And for stock 10, this parameter equals to 10.

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,810
F1 has zero mean and standard deviation of 1%.

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,550
Factor 2, F2, has a mean of 1% and a standard deviation of 1%

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,720
as well.

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,820
And the idiosyncratic shock epsilon

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,900
has zero mean and a standard deviation of 30%.

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,240
We will assume that factors F1 and F2 and the idiosyncratic

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,105
component epsilon are independent of each other.

20
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:01,480
We will also assume that there is

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,150
a risk-free asset in this market with a guaranteed

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,540
return of 0.75%.

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,840
We will first consider an equally weighted portfolio.

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,000
We will compute its Sharpe ratio.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And then we will compute return-to-risk ratio

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,580
for each individual asset for this portfolio.

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,450
Next we'll find the tangency portfolio.

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,320
We'll compute its Sharpe ratio.

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,580
We will compare the Sharpe ratio of this tangency portfolio

30
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,070
to an equally-weighted portfolio.

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,320
Then we will compute the return-to-risk ratio

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,220
for each individual asset for this tangency portfolio.

33
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,380
Let's start by computing expected returns,

34
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,860
variances, and covariances for our assets.

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,500
The expected return on stock i is given

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,770
by the following expression.

37
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,510
Recall that the mean of Factor 1 is zero

38
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,865
and the mean of Factor 2 is 1.

39
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:55,850
The mean of the idiosyncratic shock is 0 as well.

40
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,870
Therefore, the expected return on stock i

41
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,240
would simply be b2i coefficient multiplied by 1%,

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,830
Recall that b2i, for each asset i, simply equals to i.

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,230
This means that for the first stock,

44
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,180
the expected return is 1%.

45
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,980
For the second stock, the expected return

46
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,690
is 2%, et cetera.

47
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,310
And for the 10th stock, the expected return is 10%.

48
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,290
The variance of returns on stock i

49
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,940
equals to the sum of variances of b1F1 b2iF2

50
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,060
and the idiosyncratic component epsilon.

51
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,420
This is due to the fact that F1, F2, and epsilon

52
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,950
are independent of each other.

53
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,480
This gives us the following expression.

54
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,450
Recall that standard deviation of F1 and F2 is 1%

55
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,840
and the standard deviation of epsilon is 30%.

56
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,420
Therefore, the variance of returns on stock i

57
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,790
is given by the following expression at the bottom.

58
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,060
Next, let's compute the covariance of returns

59
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,760
between stocks i and j.

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,400
The covariance is given by the following expression.

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,310
Recall that, again, Fs are independent of each other

62
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,750
and of epsilon.

63
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,360
Therefore, this covariance will simply be the variance of b1F1,

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,850
and the covariance between b2iF2 and b2jF2.

65
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,880
This, in turn, equals to the following expression.

66
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,823
And plugging in variances for F1 and F2

67
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:23,740
will get that the covariance between the stock

68
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,880
returns on i and j is given by the expression at the bottom.

69
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,180
For this question, we will do all our calculations in Excel,

70
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,340
using matrix notation.

71
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,730
Before we do that, let me remind you of notation.

72
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,610
w is the vector of portfolio weights.

73
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,610
r bar is the vector of expected returns.

74
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,120
x bar is the vector of expected excess returns.

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,970
And sigma is the covariance matrix.

76
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,160
Given this notation, the expected return

77
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,230
on the portfolio w can be computed

78
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,650
by transposing the vector of weights, w,

79
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,990
multiplying by the vector of expected returns.

80
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,430
And the variance of the portfolio

81
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,370
can be computed by transposed vector of weights,

82
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,640
w, multiplied by covariance matrix sigma, multiplied

83
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,190
by the vector of weights, w.

84
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,800
Based on the results that we derived for expected returns,

85
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,590
variances and covariances, I have created the spreadsheet

86
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,380
that contains expected returns on all 10

87
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,450
stocks in this vector.

88
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,265
And this is the covariance matrix sigma.

89
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:24,640
So recall that the first question

90
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,130
is asking us to compute the expected return

91
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,630
variance and, eventually, the Sharpe

92
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,240
ratio of the equally-weighted portfolio.

93
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,790
Because we have 10 stocks, the equally-weighted portfolio

94
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,050
would invest 10% into each of these 10 stocks.

95
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,050
Let's first compute the expected return.

96
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,180
To do this, I will first transpose the matrix

97
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,990
of weights, or the vector.

98
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,320
And then, I will multiply this transposed vector

99
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,790
by the vector of expected returns.

100
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,870
And this would be the expected return on this portfolio, which

101
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,680
equals to 5.5%.

102
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,470


103
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,330
Next, we can compute the variance.

104
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,580
Remember that the variance is the transposed matrix

105
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,150
of weights.

106
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,700


107
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:29,690
This matrix is multiplied by the covariance matrix here

108
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:36,010
which, in turn, is multiplied again by the weights vector.

109
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,130


110
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,730
And this would give us the variance of this portfolio.

111
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,640
The standard deviation is just simply the squared root

112
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,730
of this variance.

113
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,790
And then the Sharpe ratio, by definition,

114
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,190
is the expected return on this portfolio

115
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,125
minus the risk-free rate divided by standard deviation.

116
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,375
So the Sharpe ratio of this equally-weighted portfolio

117
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,850
is 0.32.

118
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,040
Next, we will compute the return-to-risk ratio

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,280
for our stocks and our equally-weighted portfolio.

120
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,070
Let me remind you that the return-to-risk ratio is given

121
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,380
by the ratio of the excess return

122
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,250
on stock i divided by the covariance of returns

123
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,010
on the stock i in portfolio p, divided

124
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,387
by the standard deviation of portfolio p.

125
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:27,720
Let me also remind you that the covariance between stock

126
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,730
i and portfolio p can be computed

127
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,600
as the sum of pairwise covariances of stock i

128
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
and stocks j in the portfolio, where the weights are

129
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,750
the portfolio weights.

130
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,550
For an equally-weighted portfolio,

131
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,430
this is just the sum of all covariances

132
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,480
divided by the number of stocks in the portfolio.

133
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,160
Let's compute the return-to-risk ratio

134
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
for our 10 stocks in our equally-weighted portfolio.

135
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,310
First, I'm computing covariance, which

136
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,210
is just the weighted average of individual covariances.

137
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,070
And based on this, I'm using our expression

138
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,680
for return-to-risk ratio.

139
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,650
And I'm computing this return-to-risk ratio

140
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,950
based on this covariance that we just obtained.

141
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:16,270
And I'm doing this for all 10 stocks.

142
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,870
The results show us that stock 1 contributes

143
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,780
the least to the portfolio in terms of risk return trade off.

144
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,250
And stock 10 contributes the most.

145
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,070
And you can see that this contribution pattern is linear,

146
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,990
meaning that the stocks 10, 9, 8,

147
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,700
and so forth contribute more compared to stocks 1, 2, 3.

148
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,120
This means that we can increase the Sharpe ratio

149
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,660
by increasing the weights of these later stocks

150
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,420
in the portfolio.

151
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,780
So for example, if we increase the weight of stock 10

152
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,520
and decrease the weight of stock 1,

153
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,540
the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio should increase.

154
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,590
Let's see.

155
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,070
So our original Sharpe ratio was 0.32.

156
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,990
If I decrease the weight on the stock 1 to 5%,

157
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,220
and increase the weight of the stock 10 to 15%, what we get

158
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,570
is that the Sharpe ratio increases to 0.34.

159
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,570
Overall, the fact that the return-to-risk ratio

160
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,590
varies across different assets means that this portfolio

161
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,240
is not efficient.

162
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,900
In the next video, we will construct tangency portfolio

163
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,380
and demonstrate its efficiency.
