00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,200
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,930
learn how to construct optimal portfolios that

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,030
achieve highest Sharpe ratios.

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,410
We will work with the same two stocks, A and C,

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,500
that we worked with in the previous question.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,370
In addition to these two stocks, we will add a riskless asset

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,300
with a guaranteed return of 3%.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,150
Suppose that there are two investors, X and Z, who

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,540
maximize risk-return tradeoff and have

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,590
mean-variance preferences.

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,520
Investor X can only invest in stocks A and C.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,500
But investor Z, in addition to being

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,390
able to invest in stocks A and C,

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,660
can also invest in the riskless bond.

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,330
Investor X targets standard deviation of 20%,

16
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,400
and investor Z targets standard deviation of 12%.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,780
We will answer the following questions.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,750
A, what is the maximum Sharpe ratio investor X can achieve?

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,890
B, what is the maximum Sharpe ratio investor Z can achieve?

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,010
C, describe the portfolio of investor Z.

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,220
What is the expected return of this portfolio?

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,750
And D, if investor X had access to the risk-free asset,

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,210
could her return have been improved?

24
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,200
If yes, compute the expected return for the 20% target

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,770
level of risk.

26
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,310
Let's start with part a and compute the Sharpe ratio

27
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,920
of investor X's portfolio.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,000
Recall that in the previous video,

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,680
we have already found the maximum expected return

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,620
that the investor X can achieve on the portfolio

31
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,800
with the target level of risk of 20%.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,790
The answer was 12.25%.

33
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,070
By definition, Sharpe ratio is the difference

34
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,620
between the expected return on the portfolio

35
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,710
minus the risk-free rate divided by the standard deviation

36
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,060
of the portfolio.

37
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,910
Notice that for this investor, this is the maximum Sharpe

38
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,310
ratio, because 12.25% return is the maximum achievable return

39
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,070
for the level of risk of 20%.

40
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,230
Therefore, this investor can achieve

41
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,920
the Sharpe ratio of 0.462.

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,199
Next, let's find the maximum Sharpe ratio

43
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,570
that investor Z can achieve.

44
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,610
To do this, let's find a portfolio

45
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,960
of risky assets, A and C, which has the highest Sharpe ratio.

46
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,230
Suppose that in this portfolio, x is invested into stock A

47
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,320
and 1 minus x is invested into stock C.

48
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,180
To find the maximum Sharpe ratio,

49
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,400
we need to solve the following optimization problem.

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,760
In the numerator, we have expected return

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,260
minus the risk-free rate.

52
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,740
And in the denominator, we have the standard deviation

53
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,210
of this portfolio.

54
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,380
Notice that since covariance of returns on stocks A and C is 0,

55
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,360
the additional covariance term is

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,800
absent from this expression in the denominator.

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,160
Before we formally solve this optimization problem,

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,120
let's first see how Sharpe ratio visually looks like.

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,000
In this spreadsheet, I constructed various portfolios

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,730
that consist of stocks A and C from 0%

61
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,570
to 100% in 1% increments.

62
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,590
What I will do right now is I will compute Sharpe ratio

63
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,570
for each of these portfolios.

64
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,180
I have already computed expected return

65
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,500
on each of these individual portfolios.

66
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,400
And I have also computed the standard deviation

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,570
on these portfolios as well.

68
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,380
So now Sharpe ratio, by definition,

69
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,720
is the difference between expected return

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,170
minus the risk-free rate divided by the standard deviation

71
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,770
of the portfolio.

72
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,290
And so for this first portfolio, the Sharpe ratio is 0.425.

73
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,840
Now, we can extend this array and compute Sharpe ratios

74
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,360
for the remaining portfolios.

75
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,720
And now let's plot them and see how it looks like.

76
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,240
So this is the graph that depicts the Sharpe ratio.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,120
So we can see that it starts low.

78
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,620
It's slowly increasing.

79
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,970
It achieves the maximum somewhere.

80
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,280
And then it starts declining.

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,900
So the goal right now is to find,

82
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,830
analytically, the maximum Sharpe ratio.

83
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,640
I will use Excel to solve this optimization problem.

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,890
You're welcome to use other tools or other software.

85
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,650
Here, in this cell, I have put weight

86
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,100
that I will allocate to stock A. For now, we'll

87
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,990
just put 0 in here.

88
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,400
And in my optimization routine, I will optimize over this cell.

89
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,370
In the cell next to it, I put the complementary weight

90
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,920
that I will put on stock C. This is

91
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,290
just 1 minus whatever the weight I put on stock A. In this cell,

92
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,810
I have computed the Sharpe ratio for this portfolio

93
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,510
with this weight, given our parameters

94
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,850
for the expected return for stocks A and C

95
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,425
and their standard deviations and the risk-free rate.

96
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:47,800
Now what I will do is that I will

97
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,450
use Solver to maximize this cell, N8, by changing

98
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:02,740
the weight that I'm putting on stock A. And when I hit Solve--

99
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,470
Solver-- this is a very simple optimization problem--

100
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,010
it'll optimize and find the optimal allocation that

101
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,905
gives the highest Sharpe ratio.

102
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:12,280
In this case, the allocation will

103
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,520
be 65.31% invested into stock A and 34.69% invested

104
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,020
into stock C.

105
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,760
The portfolio that we just found,

106
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,720
by maximizing the Sharpe ratio, is the tangency portfolio.

107
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,510
The expected return, in this case, on the tangency portfolio

108
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:35,080
is 10.2%, and the standard deviation is 15.34%.

109
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,540
Now, let's go back to our investor Z.

110
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,460
Recall that she's trying to construct

111
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,625
a portfolio with the target volatility of 12%.

112
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,250
The portfolio that we just constructed,

113
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,800
the tangency portfolio, has the highest Sharpe ratio,

114
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,942
but it has a volatility of 15.34%.

115
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:54,550
Therefore, this investor cannot just invest in the tangency

116
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,540
portfolio to achieve this target volatility.

117
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,060
The solution is to mix the tangency portfolio

118
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,650
and the risk-free asset.

119
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,100
Suppose that she invests x into the tangency portfolio

120
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,980
and 1 minus x into the risk-free asset.

121
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,630
The variance of this portfolio will

122
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,090
be x squared multiplied by the variance

123
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,110
of the tangency portfolio plus 1 minus x squared multiplied

124
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,320
by the variance of the risk-free asset.

125
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,630
Notice that the covariance term here is missing,

126
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,140
because the covariance between anything that is risky

127
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,140
and the risk-free asset is 0.

128
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,420
The variance of the risk-free asset, of course, is 0 as well.

129
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,980
So therefore, this equation just becomes

130
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,450
x times sigma T equals to 0.12, which is our target standard

131
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,140
deviation.

132
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,310
Solving this equation gives us 78.24%.

133
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,670
This means that to achieve the target standard

134
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,570
deviation of 12% and the maximum possible return,

135
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,100
Z needs to invest 78.24% into the tangency portfolio

136
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,390
and 21.76% into the risk-free asset.

137
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,830
Recall, the tangency portfolio is 65.31% A

138
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:11,725
and 34.69% C. This means that investor Z's portfolio is

139
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:12,910
as follows.

140
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,350
21.76% invested into the risk-free asset.

141
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,700
51.10% invested into stock A, which we computed

142
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,990
by multiplying the weight of investor Z in the tangency

143
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,210
portfolio, 78.24%, by the weight of stock A in the tangency

144
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,820
portfolio, 65.31%.

145
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,900
And finally, 27.14% in investor Z's portfolio

146
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,690
is allocated to stock C, which again,

147
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,570
is computed by multiplying 78.24% by 34.69%.

148
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,940
Finally, we can compute the expected return

149
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,634
on investor Z's portfolio, which is 8.64%.

150
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:57,820
Taking it altogether, if investor Z targets

151
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,910
the standard deviation of 12%, the optimal portfolio

152
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,080
yields 8.64% expected return.

153
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,140
In the final part of this question,

154
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,990
we were asked whether investor X can achieve a higher risk

155
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,080
return tradeoff if she could have invested

156
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,330
in the risk-free asset as well.

157
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,850
Let's find the mix of the tangency portfolio

158
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,640
and the risk-free asset that achieves this target

159
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,010
level of standard deviation.

160
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,930
We can use the same equation as we've written for investor Z.

161
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,760
In this case, I'll use equation for x, which gives us 130.40%.

162
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,909
This means that investor X needs to invest 130.40%

163
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,750
into the tangency portfolio and negative 30.40%

164
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,260
into the risk-free asset, effectively shorting it

165
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,010
and investing these proceeds from the short sale

166
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,640
into the tangency portfolio.

167
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,740
Given the weights of stocks A and C

168
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,720
in the tangency portfolio, we can

169
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,900
compute the weights of stocks A and C

170
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,440
in investor X's portfolio.

171
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,640
So investor X's portfolio looks like this--

172
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,140
30.40% short position in the risk-free asset,

173
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:17,010
85.16% long position in stock A, and the 45.24% long position

174
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,320
in the stock C.

175
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Now we can compute the expected return of investor X's

176
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,508
portfolio, which is 12.39%.

177
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:29,880
Recall that without access to the risk-free rate,

178
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,016
investor X could have only obtained a return of 12.25%.

179
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:37,290
Now, with access to risk-free asset,

180
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:43,440
she's able to achieve additional 0.14% return without increasing

181
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,130
the risk of her portfolio.

182
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,160
The reason for this high return is

183
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,390
that when investor X has access to the risk-free asset,

184
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,060
she's able to achieve risk return combinations

185
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,090
on the capital market line, which is denoted

186
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,010
on this graph in red line.

187
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,260
Without access to the risk-free asset,

188
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,330
the only achievable portfolios for her

189
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,020
are the ones on the blue line.
