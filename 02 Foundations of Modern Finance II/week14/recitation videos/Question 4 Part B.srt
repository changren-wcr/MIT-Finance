1
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:01,680
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,900
work with the same multi-asset example.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,380
We will find the tangency portfolio,

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,720
then we will compute its Sharpe ratio,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,630
and we will compute return to risk ratio

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,718
for each individual asset for the tangency portfolio.

7
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:18,135
Record that the tangency portfolio

8
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:20,550
is given by the following expression written

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,870
in the matrix form.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,000
To find tangency portfolio, we first

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
need to invert the covariance matrix.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,700
I will use an inverse function to do this.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,330


14
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,780
Next, let's compute lambda.

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,620
Recall that lambda is the following scalar.

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,820
It's 1 divided by the transposed vector of excess returns, which

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,420
I put here, multiplied by the inverse covariance

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,300
matrix, which we just computed here,

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,020
multiplied by the vector of ones, which I put here.

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,570
Now let's do this calculation step by step.

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,420
So first I will transpose the vector of excess returns.

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:07,790
Now I will multiply this vector by the inverse covariance

23
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:15,050
matrix, and now I will multiply this product

24
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,430
by the vector of ones.

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:23,820


26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,880
Now we need to invert this number to obtain lambda.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,720
So I'll take 1, and I'll divide it by this product.

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,450
Now we can find tangency portfolio.

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,840
To do this, I'll multiply lambda by the matrix product

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,340
of the inverse covariance matrix and the vector

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,330
of excess returns, and this would give me portfolio weights

32
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,810
in the tangency portfolio.

33
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,910
Notice that in the tangency portfolio,

34
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,880
the weight of each stock increases from stock 1

35
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,230
through stock 10.

36
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,510
In fact, we're shorting the first three stocks,

37
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,540
and we're allocating a significant fraction

38
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,990
of our wealth to the last three stocks.

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,420
Let's compute the expected return, variance,

40
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,820
standard deviation, and the Sharpe ratio

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,130
of the tangency portfolio.

42
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,860
Let's start with the expected return.

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,440
I will transpose the vector weights

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,560
in the tangency portfolio, and I will

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,410
multiply this vector of weights by the expected

46
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,960
return on individual stocks.

47
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,250


48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,840
This gives me the expected return

49
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,800
on the tangency portfolio of 9.3%.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,110
Recall that the expected return on the equally

51
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,570
weighted portfolio was 5.5%.

52
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,330
So we can already see that the tangency portfolio yields

53
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,060
much higher expected return.

54
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,780
To compute the variance, I will again

55
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:04,310
transpose the vector weights of the tangency portfolio.

56
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,220
I will multiply these vector weights

57
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,490
by the covariance matrix, and then

58
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:22,200
I'll multiply this result again by the vector weights,

59
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,260
and this will give me the variance of this portfolio.

60
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,990
The standard deviation is just the square root

61
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,770
of the variance, and the standard deviation

62
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,968
of this portfolio is 20.8%.

63
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,760
So it is higher than the standard deviation

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,320
of the equally weighted portfolio, which was 14.84%.

65
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,470
Finally, now we can compare the Sharpe ratio, which

66
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,260
is the difference between the expected return

67
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,850
minus the risk-free rate divided by the standard deviation

68
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,180
of this portfolio, and the Sharpe ratio of this portfolio

69
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,900
is 0.41.

70
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,660
Recall that the Sharpe ratio of the equally weighted portfolio

71
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,580
was 0.32.

72
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,270
Therefore, we can see that the tangency portfolio exhibits

73
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,780
a much better risk return trade off compared to the equally

74
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,310
weighted portfolio.

75
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,709
Finally, let's compute return to risk ratio

76
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,240
for our individual stocks and the tangency portfolio.

77
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,120
First, let me compute covariances

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,560
between individual stocks and the tangency portfolio.

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,430
To do this, I will multiply each row of the covariace matrix

80
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,960
by the vector weights of the tangency portfolio, which

81
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,640
I have right here.

82
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,540
So this first number gives me the covariance

83
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,750
of returns on stock 1 with the returns

84
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,590
on the tangency portfolio.

85
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,890
Now we can extend the cell and compute this covariance

86
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,720
for the remaining nine stocks.

87
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,910
Before we do that, I will fix the array

88
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,330
where we have the weights of the tangency portfolio

89
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,950
so that it doesn't move when I extend this cell.

90
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,780
Now that we have our covariances computed,

91
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,110
we can compute the return to risk ratio for each stock.

92
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,740
To do this, let's take the return on each stock,

93
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,840
subtract the risk-free rate, and divide this

94
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,280
by the ratio of this covariance divided

95
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,320
by the standard deviation of the tangency portfolio,

96
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,790
and this would be the return to risk ratio for the first stock.

97
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,340
Now I can extend this array and compute return

98
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,950
to risk ratio for the remaining nine stocks.

99
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,650
Perhaps not surprisingly, return to risk ratio

100
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,030
is the same for each of the 10 stocks.

101
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,670
Moreover, this return to risk ratio for individual assets

102
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,690
is the same as the Sharpe ratio for the tangency portfolio.

103
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,040
This result implies optimality of the tangency portfolio.

104
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,010
We cannot perturb the weights of individual assets in this

105
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,770
portfolio to further increase its risk return trade off.
