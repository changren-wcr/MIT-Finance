00:00:00,317 --> 00:00:02,400
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will cover the basics

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,010
of portfolio risk and return.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,100
Suppose there are three stocks in the market, A, B, and C,

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,020
with the following properties.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,350
The expected return on stock A is 5%.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,970
The expected return on stocks B and C is 20%.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,420
The standard deviation of returns of stock A is 10%,

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,750
and the standard deviation of returns on stocks B and C

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,640
is 40%.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,610
The return on stock C is not correlated with A and B,

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,280
and the correlation of returns between A and B

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,940
is negative 0.5.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,610
We will answer the following three questions.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,060
In part a, we will assume that an investor allocates

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,650
40% of her wealth to stock A, 60% to stock C,

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,410
and nothing to stock B. What is the standard deviation

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,570
and expected return of her portfolio?

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,780
In part b, we will assume that an investor allocates

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,890
40% of her wealth to stock A, 60% of stock B,

20
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,830
and nothing to stock C. We will answer

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,000
exactly the same question.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,500
So we'll find the standard deviation

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,770
and the expected return on her portfolio.

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,050
And finally, in part c, we will assume

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,370
that an investor constructs an equally weighted portfolio out

26
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,990
of these three stocks, A, B, and C,

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,140
and we will compute the standard deviation and expected return

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,730
of her portfolio.

29
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,520
Let's denote by Ws portfolio weight.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,040
In part a, we have the following portfolio.

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,720
40% invested into stock A, nothing in stock B, and 60%

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,770
into stock C. By definition, the expected return

33
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,260
is the weighted average of expected returns

34
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,960
on individual stocks where weights

35
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,100
are the portfolio weights.

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,760
So, therefore, in our case, it is simply

37
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,410
40%, which is the weight on stock

38
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,130
A in this portfolio, multiplied by 5%, which is the expected

39
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,910
return on stock A, plus 60% weight on stock

40
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,250
C in our portfolio multiplied by 20%

41
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,610
expect the return on stock C. The middle term,

42
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:11,150
WB times R bar B is absent from this equation because WB is 0.

43
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,300
So this gives us 14% expected return on this portfolio.

44
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,710
Next, let's compute portfolio variance.

45
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,125
When we have three stocks, portfolio variance

46
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,360
is given by the following expression.

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,450
The first three terms are portfolio weight squared

48
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,110
multiplied by individual variances of stocks,

49
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,470
and the remaining three terms are pairwise covariances

50
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,950
multiplied by the weights of corresponding stocks.

51
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,190
Recall that in our case, returns on stocks A and C

52
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,960
and B and C are not correlated.

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,210
Therefore, covariance terms are 0.

54
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,810
Also recall that A and B are correlated.

55
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,880
We're given the correlation coefficient.

56
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,180
Recall that the covariance equals correlation

57
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,680
multiplied by the standard deviation

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,760
of corresponding stocks.

59
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,320
Putting all these facts together,

60
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,060
we'll get the following.

61
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,060
Because WB is 0 and because the covariance of returns

62
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,120
on A and C is 0 as well, portfolio

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,510
variance in this case is effectively just this--

64
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,780
weight on A squared times the variance of returns

65
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,920
on A plus weight on C squared times the variance of returns

66
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,070
on C. Plugging in the numbers, we

67
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,040
obtain the following variants of this portfolio.

68
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,560
Taking the square root of this number,

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,530
we obtain portfolio standard deviation, which in this case

70
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,420
is 24.33%.

71
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,920
Now let's do the same for portfolio in part b.

72
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,210
Record that this portfolio invests 40% in A, 60% in B,

73
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,080
and nothing in C. The expected return in this case

74
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,300
would equal to weight on A times the expected

75
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,040
return on A plus weight on B times the expected return on B.

76
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,270
The term C would not be there because weight is 0.

77
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,890
So we get the following, 40% times 5%, 60% times 20%,

78
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,290
this gives us the expected return

79
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,840
on this portfolio of 14%.

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,260
Recall that the expected return on portfolio in part a

81
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,780
was also 14%.

82
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,519
The reason is that the expected returns on stocks B and C

83
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,029
are the same 20%, and the only difference between these two

84
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,270
portfolios is that, in part a, we put 60% on C,

85
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,708
and, in part b, we put 60% on B.

86
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,000
Because returns on stocks A and B are correlated,

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,250
portfolio variance will have the term

88
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,410
that captures this correlation.

89
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,150
I highlighted it here in red.

90
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,500
So it's 2 times the weight on stock A

91
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,390
in this portfolio times the weight on stock

92
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,060
B times the standard deviation of returns on A,

93
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,420
which is 10%, times the standard deviation of returns

94
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,110
on B, which is 40%, times the correlation, which

95
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,910
is negative 0.5.

96
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,660
This gives us the variance of 0.0496.

97
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,790
Taking the square root of this, we

98
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,810
obtain portfolio standard deviation of 22.27%.

99
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,100
Finally, let's compute the expected return and standard

100
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,650
deviation of the portfolio in part c.

101
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,500
Recall that it's an equally weighted portfolio, which

102
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,080
means we put one third of our wealth into these three stocks.

103
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,720
The expected return on this portfolio is 15%.

104
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,910


105
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,460
The variance of this portfolio is given by this expression.

106
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,940
The first three terms are the weights multiplied

107
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,580
by the variance of corresponding stocks,

108
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,140
and the remaining term is 2 times the weights on stocks A

109
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,620
and B multiplied by the standard deviations of these stocks

110
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,515
multiplied by the correlation of returns on A and B. Recall

111
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,320
that because returns on A and C and B and C

112
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,290
are not correlated, therefore, there are no additional two

113
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,720
terms in this expression.

114
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,810
This gives us the variance of 0.0322,

115
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,140
and the standard deviation of 17.95%.

116
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,240
Let's summarize the results.

117
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,330
The expected return on portfolio a was 14%, b was 14% as well,

118
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,120
and on portfolio c it was 15%.

119
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,620
The standard deviations were 24.33 for portfolio a,

120
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:28,700
22.27 for portfolio b, and 17.95 for portfolio c.

121
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,170
Portfolio a has the same expected return as portfolio b.

122
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,310
However, because correlation between stocks A and B

123
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,030
is lower than between stocks A and C,

124
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,960
portfolio b has lower volatility.

125
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,860
Equally weighted portfolio c has high expected return

126
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,890
and lower volatility than portfolios

127
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,210
a and b because it takes fuller advantage of low correlation

128
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,550
between the three stocks, and as a result,

129
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,500
achieves a better risk-return trade off.

130
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,000
