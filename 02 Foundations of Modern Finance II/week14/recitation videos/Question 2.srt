00:00:00,365 --> 00:00:01,740
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,140
learn how to construct portfolios

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,010
with target level of expected return or target level of risk.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,440
Suppose there are two stocks, A and C,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,660
with the following properties.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,690
The expected return on stock A is 5%.

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,380
And the expected return on stock C is 20%.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,320
The standard deviation of returns in stock A is 10%.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,860
And the standard deviation of returns in stock C is 40%.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,740
The returns on stocks A and C are not correlated.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,520
First, we will build a portfolio with expected return of 10%.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,850
Next, we will assume that the maximum level

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,260
of risk that an investor can afford to take is 20%.

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,290
We will build a portfolio that achieves

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,000
this target level of risk.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
And we will find the expected return of that portfolio.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,360
Finally, we will assume that there is an investor

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,410
with low tolerance for risk.

19
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,040
We will construct a minimum variance portfolio

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,270
for this investor.

21
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,340
And we will find the expected return of this portfolio.

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,379
Let's first build a portfolio with the target

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,200
expected return of 10%.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,160
Suppose that we invest x in stock A and the remaining

25
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,450
amount, 1 minus x, into stock C. Then,

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,870
the expected return would be x times the expected return

27
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,610
of stock A plus 1 minus x, the expected return on stock C.

28
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,510
And that should equal to 10%, which is our target.

29
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,730
Plugging in the numbers for expected return on A,

30
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,620
which is 5%, and the expected return on C, which is 20%,

31
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,140
we get this equation.

32
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,010
So this is just the equation with one unknown.

33
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,060
Solving this equation, we get x that equals to 2/3.

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,090
This means that to achieve this target level of expected

35
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,070
return, we need to invest 2/3 of our wealth into stock A

36
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,150
and the remaining 1/3 of our wealth into stock C. Next,

37
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,010
let's build a portfolio with a target

38
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,230
level of volatility of 20%.

39
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,990
This 20% is a standard deviation.

40
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,120
Suppose that we invest x into A and 1 minus x into C. Then,

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,520
portfolio variance would be x squared

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,420
multiplied by the variance of stock A, which

43
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,390
is 0.1 squared, plus 1 minus x squared--

44
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,350
this is the weight that we put into stock C squared--

45
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,840
times the variance of stock C. And that

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,580
should equal to the target variance

47
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,140
that we are trying to achieve, which is 20% squared.

48
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,190
Rearranging terms in this equation,

49
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,780
we get the following quadratic equation.

50
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,360
Solving this equation, we get two roots--

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,500
x equals to 1.365 and x equals to 0.517.

52
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,010
This implies that we have two portfolio candidates.

53
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,830
In the first portfolio, we invest 136.5% into stock A

54
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,910
and negative 36.5% into stock C. This

55
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,280
means that we are effectively shorting stock C

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,720
and putting the dollar proceeds from this short sale

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,370
into stock A.

58
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,855
And the second candidate is where we invest 51.7% into A

59
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:15,670
and 48.3% into stock C. Both of these portfolios

60
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,820
achieve the target level of volatility of 20%,

61
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,225
but which one is better?

62
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:22,600
Let's compute the expected return

63
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,700
and see which of these portfolios

64
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,600
gives us a higher return.

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,090
The expected return of the first portfolio is negative 0.48%.

66
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,950
And the expected return of the second portfolio is 12.25%.

67
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,570
So clearly, the second portfolio gives higher risk

68
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,520
return tradeoff, and therefore this

69
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,820
is the optimal portfolio for the target level of risk

70
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,660
that we are trying to achieve.

71
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,640
Finally, let's find the minimum variance portfolio.

72
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,910
Let's, again, suppose that we invest x into A and 1

73
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,650
minus x into C. To find the minimum variance portfolio,

74
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,660
we need to minimize this variance with respect to x.

75
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,700
Solving this minimization problem,

76
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,750
we'd get that x equals to 94.12%.

77
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,230
Therefore, to construct the minimum variance portfolio,

78
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,399
we invest 94.12% into stock A and 5.88%

79
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,730
into stock C. This portfolio achieves

80
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,060
the standard deviation of 9.7% and the expected

81
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,500
return of 5.88%.

82
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,000
