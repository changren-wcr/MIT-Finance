1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,720
PROFESSOR: We'll now solve for the optimal composition

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,990
of the tangency portfolio analytically.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,610
We start with some notation.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,300
There are n risky assets in the market.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,200
We collect the expected returns into a vector, r-bar.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,920
The vector of expected excess returns is x-bar.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,590
We denote the covariance matrix of returns by sigma.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,200
I is the vector of once.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,740
And w is the vector of portfolio weights of the risky assets.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,380
Note that because the vector of portfolio weights

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,410
includes only the risky assets, these weights

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,990
do not need to sum up to one.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,290
Instead, we explicitly substitute out the weight

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,020
of the risk-free asset.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,630
The weight of the risk-free asset in the portfolio

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,960
is equal to one minus the scalar product

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,180
of the vector of portfolio weights

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,900
with the vector of once.

19
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,120
We now state the mean variance portfolio choice problem.

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,390
The objective is to minimize the variance of the portfolio,

21
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,140
which is given by the covariance matrix of risky asset

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,250
returns multiplied on both sides by the vector of portfolio

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,940
weights.

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,450
We minimize portfolio variance, subject to the constraint

25
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,360
on the expected excess return.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,300
The expected excess return on the portfolio

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,130
must be equal to the target m.

28
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,060
We solve this problem for an arbitrary level of the expected

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,240
return target.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to characterize

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,770
the optimal solution.

32
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,110
The Lagrangian is a quadratic function

33
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,220
of portfolio weights with the multiplier on the constraint

34
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,160
given by 2 times lambda.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,770
We obtain the first order optimality conditions

36
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,680
by differentiating the Lagrangian with respect

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,680
to the vector of portfolio weights.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,040
The first order conditions are sufficient to characterize

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,490
the optimal portfolio because the Lagrangian is a convex

40
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,820
function.

41
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,210
Recall that the covariance matrix of returns

42
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,090
is positive definite.

43
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,930
In vector form, the solution of the first order optimality

44
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,430
conditions states that the vector of portfolio weights

45
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,750
is proportional to the inverse of the covariance matrix

46
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,510
multiplied by the vector of expected excess returns.

47
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,370
The coefficient of proportionality,

48
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,450
lambda, depends on the level of the expected excess return

49
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,320
target, m.

50
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,340
For the tangency portfolio, the weights on risky assets

51
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,330
must add up to 1.

52
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,090
Recall that this portfolio does not

53
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,750
include the risk-free asset.

54
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,220
Imposing this constraint, we solve

55
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,700
for the proportionality coefficient lambda

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,420
and find the explicit expression for the tangency portfolio

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,620
weights.

58
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,890
To illustrate our general result,

59
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,970
consider the following example.

60
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,190
We are solving an asset allocation problem

61
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,830
among three assets--

62
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,840
the risk-free asset, T-bills, and two risky assets,

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,150
the stock market index and the hedge fund index.

64
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,720
We assume that returns on the stock market index, which

65
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,270
we abbreviate as SMI, and the hedge fund index, or HFI,

66
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,770
are uncorrelated.

67
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,980
We want to know what fraction of the tangency portfolio

68
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,910
should be invested in the hedge fund index.

69
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,970
We also want to compare the Sharpe ratios of the stock

70
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,890
market index and the hedge fund index on a standalone basis

71
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,990
to the Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio.

72
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,080
This would allow us to quantify the economic benefit

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,640
of combining these investments.

74
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,290
We are given the following data.

75
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,540
The risk-free rate is 3%.

76
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,880
The expected return on the stock market index is 9%.

77
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,090
And the standard deviation of the stock market index is 20%.

78
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,720
The hedge fund index has the expected return

79
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,990
of 5%, which is much lower than that for the stock market.

80
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,480
And the standard deviation is 10%,

81
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,830
which is also lower than the standard deviation of the stock

82
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,590
market.

83
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,260
We apply our general solution.

84
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,900
The weights in the tangency portfolio

85
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,660
are proportional to the inverse of the covariance matrix

86
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,390
of returns times the vector of expected excess returns.

87
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,340
Note that in this case because returns on the two risky assets

88
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,440
are uncorrelated with each other,

89
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,560
the covariance matrix of returns is diagonal.

90
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,830
And we can invert it by simply taking the inverse

91
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,220
of each diagonal element.

92
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,370
As a result, the ratio of the weights

93
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:08,540
on the stock market index versus the hedge fund index is 1.5 to 2.

94
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,480
We conclude that the tangency portfolio allocates

95
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,940
43% of its weight to the stock market

96
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,930
index and 57%, which is more than a half,

97
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,850
to the hedge fund index.

98
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,590
Does this mean that the hedge fund index

99
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,320
is a better investment than the stock market

100
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,870
index on the standalone basis?

101
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,790
The answer is negative.

102
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,280
Recall that the Sharpe ratio of an asset

103
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,310
is the ratio of its expected excess return

104
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,890
to its standard deviation.

105
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,260
The Sharpe ratio of the stock market index is 30%.

106
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,220
For the hedge fund index, it is lower, 20%.

107
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,050
Why is it that the hedge fund index has a lower Sharpe ratio

108
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,390
but receives such a high allocation

109
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,420
in the tangency portfolio?

110
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,510
Hedge fund index is a great diversifier to the stock market

111
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:08,650
portfolio because we assume that the two are uncorrelated.

112
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,290
This makes the hedge fund index an appealing investment,

113
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,370
even though its Sharpe ratio is relatively low.

114
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,640
Also, know that the magnitude of portfolio weights

115
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,030
is difficult to interpret.

116
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,220
The more intuitive quantity would

117
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,160
be the quantity of risk or variance

118
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,510
that each position contributes to the tangency portfolio.

119
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,180
The hedge fund index has a much lower standard deviation.

120
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,280
So despite of its higher weight, it contributes less than half

121
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,480
of the risk of the tangency portfolio.

122
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,210
This is consistent with the hedge fund index

123
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,596
being a less appealing investment with a lower Sharpe

124
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:51,430
ratio.

125
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,770
To conclude, we compute the Sharpe ratio

126
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,160
of the tangency portfolio.

127
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,670
It is the weighted average of expected excess returns

128
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,890
on the stock market index and the hedge fund index,

129
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,870
which are 6% and 2%, respectively,

130
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,850
using their weights in the tangency portfolio.

131
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:16,370
43% and 57% divided by the standard deviation

132
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,550
of the tangency portfolio.

133
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,730
We find the Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio to be 36%.

134
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,490
This is a sizable improvement over the stock market

135
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,130
index, which has the Sharpe ratio of 30%.

136
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,260
Although the hedge fund index earns

137
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,080
relatively low excess returns, because of its low volatility,

138
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,270
it has a Sharpe ratio close to that of the stock market index.

139
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,080
Combined with zero correlation between these two investments,

140
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,920
this allows us to diversify risk between the two investments

141
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,250
and raise the Sharpe ratio relative to each of them

142
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,880
individually.

143
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,940
As a thought experiment, if the hedge fund index

144
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,450
earns zero risk premium, then the tangency portfolio

145
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,100
would allocate 100% to the stock market index.

146
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,800
This highlights the fact that to raise the Sharpe

147
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,520
ratio be diversification, low correlation is not sufficient.

148
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,660
We need to be able to earn risk premia by taking

149
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,905
on uncorrelated risks.

150
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:23,590


151
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,810
We now introduce investor preferences

152
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,850
to the portfolio choice problem.

153
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,539
We've established that all mean variance investors choose

154
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:37,750
the same portfolio of risky assets, the tangency portfolio.

155
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,020
Individual risk aversion determines what fraction

156
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,660
of the portfolio an investor allocates to the safe asset

157
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,780
and what fraction goes to the risky assets,

158
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,480
the tangency portfolio.

159
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,910
The problem of finding the optimal portfolio

160
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,620
is, therefore, decoupled into two independent steps.

161
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,370
We first compute the tangency portfolio independently

162
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,080
of the investor's preferences.

163
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,680
Then we decide what fraction of the portfolio

164
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,020
to allocate to the tangency portfolio,

165
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,990
depending on the risk aversion of the investor.

166
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,130
Our two panels illustrate the solution of the problem.

167
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,460
The only difference between these panels

168
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,950
is investor's risk aversion.

169
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,320
The distribution of returns from financial assets

170
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,280
is exactly the same.

171
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,310
Take a look at the panel on the left.

172
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,010
We first compute the tangency portfolio

173
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,520
and construct the capital market line.

174
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,520
We then show the investor's level curves

175
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,470
in the space of expected return and standard deviation.

176
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,290
Recall that the level of the investor's objective

177
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,730
is the same along each level curve and increases

178
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,580
as we move towards the top left corner of the plot.

179
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,420


180
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,320
This investor wants to find the portfolio on the capital market

181
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,160
line that achieves the highest value of her objective.

182
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,680
This means that the optimal portfolio

183
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,180
is located at the point where the capital market line touches

184
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,190
the highest possible level curve.

185
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,100
The panel on the left represents an investor

186
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,280
with a relatively high risk aversion.

187
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,490
This investor combines the tangency portfolio

188
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,340
with the long position in the risk-free asset

189
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,440
to create the optimal portfolio.

190
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,100
The panel on the right shows indifference curves for a less

191
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,930
risk averse investor.

192
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,100
This investor forms the optimal portfolio in the same manner

193
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,220
as we just discussed, but because of the lower risk

194
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,820
aversion, the optimal portfolio includes a short position

195
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,380
in the safe asset.

196
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,380
This investor levers up the tangency portfolio

197
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,950
by borrowing.

198
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,450
The optimal portfolio then ends up on the capital market line

199
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,500
to the right of the tangency portfolio.

200
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,000
