1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,730
PROFESSOR: We start with the simplest case of portfolio

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,470
choice with two risky assets.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,530
Recall that the expected return on the portfolio

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,140
is a weighted average of expected returns

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,970
on the portfolio assets.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,480
The variance of portfolio return is a quadratic function

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,330
of portfolio weights and depends on the individual return

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:28,620
variances and the covariance of returns among the two assets.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,070
As an example, consider two ETFs, SPY and AGG.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:40,070
SPY is an Equity ETF represented in the S&P 500 index.

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,650
AGG represents the aggregate investment grade bond index.

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,180
In our analysis here, we use the sample moments of asset returns

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,400
as the true population moments.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,680
With only two assets in the portfolio,

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,840
there is only one possible combination

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,020
of portfolio weights for each level of the expected

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,680
return on the portfolio.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,930
In the following table, we summarize

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,630
the relation between the portfolio weights

20
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,950
and the moments of portfolio returns.

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,600
This table tells us what level of portfolio risk corresponds

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,630
to each given level of portfolio expected return.

23
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,350
Here we represent the set of portfolios of SPY and AGG

24
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,180
graphically.

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,870
The curve is in the space of standard deviation and expected

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,420
return.

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,520
This curve represents the trade off

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,940
between the expected return on the portfolio and the level

29
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,990
of portfolio risk.

30
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,550
Note that we did not consider negative portfolio weights.

31
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,300
The curve here represents long-only portfolios.

32
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,430
As a result, the two assets AGG and SPY are located at the two

33
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,890
ends of the portfolio set.

34
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,100
If we allow for short sales, portfolio weights

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,940
may be negative.

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,300
We extend our table to allow for negative weights

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,699
on each of the two assets.

38
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,560
We show the corresponding relation

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,380
between the expected return and portfolio

40
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,680
risk on the following graph.

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,520
Because we allow short sales, the two assets no longer

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,260
define the end points of the curve.

43
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,890
In fact, there are no end points.

44
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,850
The curve extends indefinitely, spanning all possible levels

45
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,770
of expected return.

46
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,340
The level of portfolio risk is bounded from below.

47
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,800
There is a single portfolio achieving

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,430
the lowest possible level of standard deviation.

49
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,170
This portfolio is known as the minimum variance portfolio.

50
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,540
Although the portfolio choice with two assets

51
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,970
is extremely simple, we can already

52
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,226
say something non-trivial about the optimal choice.

53
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:57,680
No mean variance investor would want

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,970
to hold the portfolio below the minimum variance portfolio.

55
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,980
The reason is that, for any portfolio on the bottom portion

56
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,130
of the curve, we can find another portfolio

57
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,820
on the top portion with the same level of risk

58
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,940
and a higher level of expected return.

59
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,060
We say that the bottom portion of the portfolio set

60
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,800
is inefficient.

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,430
Each of these portfolios is dominated by another feasible

62
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,210
portfolio and would not be chosen by any optimizing

63
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,650
investor.

64
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,650
Next we consider an important special case

65
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,310
where the second asset is risk free.

66
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,220
Then the standard deviation of the portfolio

67
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,380
is a linear function of the portfolio

68
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,840
weight of the first asset.

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,660
So is the portfolio's expected return.

70
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,050
As a result, the set of efficient portfolios

71
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,640
forms a straight line in the risk expected return space,

72
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,150
connecting the point on the vertical axis representing

73
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,770
the risk-free asset with the risky asset.

74
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,970
The lowest possible level of portfolio risk is zero.

75
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,060
It is achieved by the risk-free asset.

76
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,970
All portfolios with expected return

77
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,260
lower than the risk-free rate of return are inefficient.

78
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,390
And we show them here with a dashed line.

79
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,050


80
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,750
Although the case of two assets with one of them

81
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,110
risk-free appears to be extremely special,

82
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,210
we will see that this is an important part

83
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,690
of a general solution to the portfolio choice problem

84
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,500
with multiple risky assets.

85
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,000
