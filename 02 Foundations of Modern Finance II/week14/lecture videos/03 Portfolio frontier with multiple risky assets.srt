1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,430
PROFESSOR: Next, we consider portfolio choice

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,980
with multiple risky assets.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,800
We allow for unlimited short sales.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,650
Later, we will derive an explicit analytical solution

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,320
of this problem.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,330
For now, let's consider a plot of the solution.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,970
We are plotting the set of portfolios

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,910
with the lowest possible risk for any given

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,690
level of expected return.

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,290
These are called the mean variance optimal portfolios.

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,860
The curve representing the set of optimal portfolios

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,650
in the mean standard deviation space

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,710
is called the portfolio frontier.

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,410
The upper part of the portfolio frontier

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,180
is called the efficient frontier.

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,670
Investors with mean various preferences

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,910
should only consider investing in efficient portfolios.

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,960
Any other portfolio is dominated.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,080
One can find another portfolio with the same level

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,810
of expected return and lower risk,

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,200
or in case of the inefficient portfolio on the portfolio

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,590
frontier, one can achieve the same level of risk

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,320
with a higher level of expected return.

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,080
The concept of the efficient portfolio frontier

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,830
greatly simplifies the portfolio choice problem.

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,160
We can reduce the set of all possible portfolios

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,880
to a much smaller subset, the efficient frontier,

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,520
without knowing the precise preferences of the investor.

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,740
We can then draw general conclusions

30
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,030
about optimal portfolios chosen by many different investors,

31
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,640
all mean various optimizers, but possibly

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,970
with very different attitudes towards risk.

33
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,350
Next, note that none of the five ETFs

34
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,370
end up on the portfolio frontier.

35
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,250
This is in contrast to the case of two risky assets.

36
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,460
With multiple assets, frontier portfolios

37
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,600
typically strictly dominate each of the individual assets.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,920
Our next plot compares two portfolio frontiers.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,310
The solid blue line shows the frontier constructed

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,660
using all five of our ETFs.

41
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,310
The dashed red line shows the frontier

42
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,730
constructed using a subset with three tiers, the AGG, SPY,

43
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,600
and IAU.

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Note that the three asset frontier

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,440
is to the right from the five asset one.

46
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,060
That is intuitive.

47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,630
One can always do at least as well with extra assets,

48
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,400
because the option of not investing

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,240
in them is one of the choices.

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,000
