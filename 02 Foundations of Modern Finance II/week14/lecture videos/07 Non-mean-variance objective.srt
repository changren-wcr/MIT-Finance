1
00:00:00,755 --> 00:00:02,630
PROFESSOR: We'll now discuss some limitations

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,720
of the mean variance framework for portfolio choice

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,310
and consider some extensions.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:14,810
One important limitation is that our formulation is static.

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,840
We construct the portfolio at time zero

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,280
and evaluate the outcome next period.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,950
We do not rebalance the portfolio over time.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,680
And we do not evaluate the time path of the portfolio value.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,250
In practice, portfolio choice problems are often dynamic.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,360
For example, consider a problem faced

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,120
by a household with multiple consumption objectives

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,790
over the life cycle.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,890
This household would need to think

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,680
about intertemporal trade-offs and would

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,610
have to rebalance its investments multiple times.

16
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,950
To solve this problem, one would need

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,950
to learn how to construct dynamic plans.

18
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,020
This is one direction for extending our results.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,540
The technical tools needed for this problem

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,070
come from dynamic programming, an area of optimization dealing

21
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,070
with multi-period decision problems.

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,150
Even in static problems, the objective of the investor

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,550
may not be fully described by the first two

24
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,820
moments of portfolio returns.

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,000
For example, suppose an investor wants

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,440
to maximize expected portfolio return subject to a penalty,

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,090
which is applied whenever the value of the portfolio

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,490
falls below a given threshold.

29
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,060
We can capture this and various other objectives

30
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,830
using the expected utility framework.

31
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,290
For our example in particular, one

32
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,000
may formulate a utility function to be equal to portfolio value

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,090
whenever this value is above the threshold

34
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,330
and, otherwise, linear with a slope higher

35
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,700
than one if the value of the portfolio

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,810
is below the threshold.

37
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,040
By construction, this objective penalizes outcomes

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,210
that fall below the threshold.

39
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,190
The strength of the penalty is controlled

40
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,620
by the parameter a, which describes

41
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,680
the difference in the slope of the utility curve

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,800
below and above the threshold.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,220
We now consider the marginal contribution of an asset

44
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,110
to the expected utility objective.

45
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,400
And compare this to our results for the mean variance

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,790
objective.

47
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,660
Consider the expected utility.

48
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,920
We assume that the portfolio value starts at one.

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,710
And then the utility is defined over the end

50
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,095
of period portfolio value, which is

51
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:49,180
one plus the portfolio return.

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,820
The first order optimality condition

53
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,750
states that the derivative of the expected utility

54
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,380
with respect to each portfolio weight should be zero.

55
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,320
For asset I, this condition requires

56
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,950
that the expected value of the excess return on asset

57
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,300
I scaled by the marginal utility at the end of the period

58
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,230
is equal to zero.

59
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,280
We can rewrite this condition as the sum of two terms being

60
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,300
equal to zero.

61
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,460
The first term is a product of the risk premium on asset I

62
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,300
and the expected marginal utility of terminal portfolio

63
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,330
value.

64
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,910
The second term is the covariance

65
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,730
of the return on asset I with the marginal utility.

66
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,310
We observe that in this formulation

67
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,760
the marginal contribution of the asset to portfolio risk

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,360
is measured by the covariance of the return

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,350
and the marginal utility of portfolio value.

70
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,830
Because marginal utility is generally non-linear,

71
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,380
this measure emphasizes non-linear measures

72
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,850
of dependence between individual asset returns and portfolio

73
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,810
returns.

74
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,440
For example, the marginal contribution

75
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,680
of asset I to portfolio risk may now

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,440
depend on the covariance of its return

77
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,130
with the squared portfolio return called coskewness.

78
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,459
This stands in contrast to the mean varianace results,

79
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,030
where the marginal contribution of an asset to portfolio risk

80
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,790
was fully captured by a linear measure of dependence,

81
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,470
return covariance.

82
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,930
Another important implication of our analysis

83
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,800
here is that, under the expected utility objective,

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,040
different investors no longer hold the same risky portfolio.

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,650
The shape of the individual utility function

86
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,570
affects the optimal portfolio composition.
