1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,720
PROFESSOR: In this segment, we establish an important property

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,210
of the tangency portfolio.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,540
It's an optimality condition, which

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,940
relates expected returns on all assets,

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,260
and their co-variances with the tangency portfolio.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,890
First, we describe the contribution of each asset

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,455
to a portfolio.

8
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,990
Portfolio return is a weighted average

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,380
of individual asset returns.

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,369
If we let w denote the weights on the risky assets

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,770
and isolate the risk free asset in the expression,

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,310
we find that the return on the portfolio

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,160
is equal to the risk free rate of return

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,790
plus the weighted average of excess returns

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,020
on the risky assets.

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,150
Each asset contributes to the properties

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,140
of the portfolio in two ways.

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,490
It contributes to the portfolio expected return,

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,640
and it contributes to portfolio risk

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,060
measured by the standard deviation of portfolio return.

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,410
We consider these two dimensions separately.

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,630
The expected return on the portfolio

23
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,960
is the risk free rate plus the weighted average

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,540
of expected excess returns on individual assets.

25
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,290
We want to describe the marginal contribution of each asset

26
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,210
to the portfolio properties.

27
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,270
The term marginal contribution refers

28
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,670
to the change in portfolio properties

29
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,460
due to a very small incremental change

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,260
in the weight of an asset.

31
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,810
Mathematically, marginal contribution

32
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,520
is described by a partial derivative.

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,890
Holding everything else fixed, we

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,010
want to know how portfolio properties change

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,640
as we vary the weight of each asset slightly.

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,870
Taking a partial derivative of the portfolio expected return

37
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,200
with respect to the portfolio weight on asset I,

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,250
we find that the marginal contribution of risky asset

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,340
I to the expected return on the portfolio

40
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,780
is equal to its own risk premium.

41
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,080
Next, we consider how individual assets contribute

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,450
to portfolio variance.

43
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,260
The variance of portfolio return is given by a sum

44
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,000
across all pairs of assets of their covariance scaled

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,180
by the product of corresponding portfolio weights.

46
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,040
The marginal contribution of asset

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,660
I is the partial derivative of portfolio variance with respect

48
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,840
to the weight on asset I. As the following expression

49
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,300
shows, this partial derivative is

50
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,300
equal to twice the covariance of return

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,220
on asset I with the portfolio return.

52
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,710
This is an important result.

53
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,070
At the portfolio level, the relevant measure of risk

54
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,100
is not the individual variance of the asset,

55
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,430
but rather its contribution to the total portfolio variance.

56
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,800
On the margin, this contribution is

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
captured by the covariance of the asset with the portfolio

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,760
return.

59
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,370
Using the chain rule for differentiation,

60
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,260
we find that the marginal contribution

61
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,650
of an asset to the standard deviation of the portfolio

62
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,310
is equal to its covariance with the portfolio divided

63
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,630
by the portfolio standard deviation.

64
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,470
Next, we summarize the marginal contribution

65
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,950
of each asset of the portfolio by its marginal return

66
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,390
to risk ratio.

67
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,620
This is the ratio of the marginal contribution

68
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,550
of the asset to the expected return on the portfolio divided

69
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,560
by its marginal contribution to portfolio

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,290
risk or standard deviation.

71
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,230
Using our previous results, we find

72
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,840
that the marginal return to risk ratio

73
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,070
is the risk premium of the asset normalized

74
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,010
by the ratio of its covariance with the portfolio

75
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,910
to the portfolio standard deviation.

76
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,290
We now observe that optimality of the tangency portfolio

77
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,040
implies that for all assets, the marginal return

78
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,190
to risk ratio with respect to the tangency portfolio

79
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,660
is the same.

80
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,019
And in fact, this is equal to the Sharpe ratio

81
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,860
of the tangency portfolio.

82
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,520
We could derive this result by rearranging the expression

83
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,850
for the composition of the tangency portfolio.

84
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,340
It is more instructive to visualize the logic

85
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,460
behind this result graphically.

86
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,670
As we change the weight on the particular asset,

87
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,280
we are changing both the expected return

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,650
and the risk of the portfolio.

89
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,990
Let's perturb the weight of asset I

90
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,950
in the tangency portfolio.

91
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,880
The resulting change in the expected return and risk

92
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,760
will move the tangency portfolio on our plot

93
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,890
along the dashed red line.

94
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,650
The slope of the line by definition

95
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,620
is the marginal return to risk ratio of asset

96
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,080
I with respect to the tangency portfolio.

97
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,380
Note that in order for the tangency portfolio to be

98
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,660
optimal, the dashed line cannot cross the capital market line.

99
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,660
If it did, we would be able to improve the Sharpe

100
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,270
ratio of the tangency portfolio, which

101
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,500
is impossible due to its optimality.

102
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,250
Therefore, the dashed line must have the same slope

103
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,560
as the capital market line, which

104
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,670
is the Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio.

105
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,205
It is important to keep in mind that the result, we

106
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,760
just derived, is a mathematical identity.

107
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,220
It does not tell us anything about the properties

108
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,800
of expected returns of various assets.

109
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,620
This result is a statement about the tangency portfolio itself.

110
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,780
The composition of this portfolio

111
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,810
must be such that for all assets,

112
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,180
the marginal return to risk ratio

113
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,480
relative to the tangency portfolio is the same.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,730
We now offer an equivalent characterization

115
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,950
of the tangency portfolio, which is very

116
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,920
useful in empirical analysis.

117
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,010
Consider a linear relation, a regression

118
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,970
of excess return of asset I on the excess return

119
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,770
on the tangency portfolio.

120
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,560
Keep in mind that we have here a relation

121
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,570
between random variables rather than a finite sample result.

122
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,650
In this linear relation, the slope of the beta

123
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,050
is equal to the covariance of asset I

124
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,570
and the tangency portfolio divided

125
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,700
by the variance of the tangency portfolio.

126
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,190
According to our optimality result,

127
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,340
the intercept in this regression or the alpha

128
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,990
must be equal to zero.

129
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,970
We can, therefore, test for mean variance

130
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,750
optimality of portfolios in the data using regression methods.

131
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,860
If we regress historical returns of an asset on the portfolio

132
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,430
return, we can test for portfolio optimality

133
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,150
by testing the null hypothesis that the intercept coefficient

134
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,500
in this regression is zero.

135
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,000
