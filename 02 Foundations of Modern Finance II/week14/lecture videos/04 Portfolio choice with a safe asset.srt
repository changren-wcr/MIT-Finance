1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,690
PROFESSOR: We now add a risk-free asset to the mix.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,970
We still have multiple risky assets.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,440
With the risk-free asset in the portfolio,

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,340
we can express each portfolio as a combination of two positions.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,730
One is the risk-free asset.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,550
And the other is a portfolio consisting only

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,810
of the risky assets.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,150
As an example, consider a portfolio

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,860
with $40 invested in the risk-free asset and $60 split

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,810
evenly between the equity index and a long-term bond index.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,040
This portfolio has 40% invested in the risk-free asset.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,050
And the weights of equities and long-term bonds are 30% each.

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,240
We can alternatively view this portfolio

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,780
as a combination of two positions, 40% invested

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,760
in the risk-free asset and 60% invested in a portfolio of only

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,960
risky assets, which has 50% in equities

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,390
and 50% in long-term bonds.

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,980
More generally, consider a portfolio p with a fraction

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,400
x invested in a risky portfolio q

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,660
and fraction 1 minus x invested in the risk-free asset.

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,240
The expected return on portfolio p

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,080
is a weighted average of the risk-free rate of return

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,170
and the expected return on portfolio q

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,360
with the weights 1 minus x and x, respectively.

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,850
The return variance on portfolio p

26
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,840
equals the return variance of portfolio q times the square

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,590
of the weight on q.

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,620
Next consider the optimal portfolio choice

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,120
with the risk-free asset.

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,490
Prior to deriving the analytical solution to this problem,

31
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,100
we can gain some intuition from its graphical representation.

32
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,960
Start with the portfolio frontier

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,210
of risky assets, which is the red curve.

34
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,590
Select an arbitrary portfolio, either on the frontier,

35
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,800
represented by the blue circle, or strictly

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,139
to the right of the frontier, represented

37
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,530
by the green circle.

38
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,840
We combine each of these two portfolios

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,110
with the risk-free asset.

40
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,860
As a result, we are able to create any of the portfolios

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,810
on the blue and green dashed lines.

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,580
Know that all of these portfolios are inefficient.

43
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,000
They are dominated by the portfolios

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,080
on the solid black line, which combines a particular frontier

45
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,900
portfolio with the risk-free asset.

46
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,210
This frontier portfolio is the so-called tangency portfolio.

47
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,000
Its position on the portfolio frontier

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,760
is at a point where, if connected

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,280
to the risk-free asset, the resulting line

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,220
is tangent to the frontier.

51
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,890
The efficient frontier obtained by combining

52
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,130
the tangency portfolio with the risk-free asset

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,000
has the highest possible slope.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,580
That is another way to define the tangency point.

55
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,030
It is clear that the resulting set of portfolios

56
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,780
dominates any other combination of the risk-free asset

57
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,710
with the portfolio on or to the right of the red curve, which

58
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,920
is the portfolio frontier of risky assets.

59
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,610
The black line is called the capital market line.

60
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,040
It represents the efficient frontier

61
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,870
in the presence of the risk-free asset.

62
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,260
The tangency portfolio plays a very important role

63
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,940
in our analysis.

64
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,970
In particular, as our discussion shows,

65
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,890
all mean variance investors should

66
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,200
hold the combination of the same portfolio

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,530
of risky assets, the tangency portfolio,

68
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,070
and the risk-free asset.

69
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,650
This is a striking result. All mean

70
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,020
variance investors optimally choose

71
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,640
to hold the same index of stocks.

72
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,010
We now introduce an important measure

73
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,940
of the risk return trade off of a portfolio called the Sharpe

74
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,560
ratio.

75
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,320
This ratio was introduced by William Sharpe,

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,710
one of the creators of the capital asset pricing model.

77
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,550
The Sharpe ratio is equal to the expected excess return

78
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:23,320
of the portfolio divided by its standard deviation.

79
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,060
If we think of standard deviation

80
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,730
as the quantitative measure of risk,

81
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,240
the Sharpe ratio tells us how much compensation

82
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,480
in the form of the risk premium a given portfolio

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,150
provides per unit of risk.

84
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,360
On our graph, the Sharpe ratio is the slope

85
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,060
of the line connecting a portfolio

86
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,510
with the risk-free asset.

87
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,990
The tangency portfolio has the highest Sharpe ratio

88
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,790
among all possible portfolios.

89
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,060
In other words, all mean variance investors

90
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,550
choose the risky portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.

91
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,740
All other portfolios on the capital market line,

92
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,280
which includes the tangency portfolio,

93
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,150
have the same Sharpe ratio.

94
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,000
