00:00:00,132 --> 00:00:02,340
INSTRUCTOR: This week, we introduced the fundamentals

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,560
of portfolio theory.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,860
Our focus is on portfolio choice under mean variance

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,795
preferences.

5
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:13,360
We solved for optimal portfolio with and without the risk

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,149
free asset and characterized the main properties

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,080
of the optimal portfolios.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,150
We also point out the limitations

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,970
of the mean variance framework and introduce

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,890
a more general formulation using the expected utility theory.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,560
Portfolio choice is an example of decision

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,130
making under uncertainty.

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,280
Among all possible distributions of portfolio value

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,710
next period, we choose the one that

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,350
is optimal for a particular investor.

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,440
We rank the distributions of portfolio value

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,620
using expected utility.

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,100
As a result, the objective of portfolio choice

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,890
is to find the composition of the portfolio that

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,425
maximizes the expected utility of the investor.

21
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,680


22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,410
An important special case of this problem

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,710
is the case of mean variance preferences.

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,530
This is the subject of what is called the modern portfolio

25
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,880
theory, and from now, we will assume that investors maximize

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,670
a mean variance objective.

27
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,040
The objective for the investor includes

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,000
the mean and the variance of portfolio return.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,550
With these preferences, the investor

30
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,050
seeks to minimize portfolio risk for a given level of portfolio

31
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,980
expected return.

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,920
For a given level of portfolio risk,

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,640
investors maximize expected return.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,680
We can visualize the investors objective

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,960
on the following graph.

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,710
The horizontal axis represents portfolio risk.

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,320
The vertical axis represents the expected return

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,640
on the portfolio.

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,730
The solid curves represent the combinations

40
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,030
of risk and expected return corresponding

41
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,450
to a given level of investor's objective.

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,730
An investor is indifferent among all the points on a given

43
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,780
curve.

44
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,690
These are the level curves.

45
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,910
Because the investor prefers low risk and high expected return,

46
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,550
the objective of the investor increases

47
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,580
as we move across the level curves

48
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,770
towards the upper left corner of the plot.

49
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,320
We can represent the portfolio choice problem

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,350
as the following problem.

51
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,870
Among all the portfolios with the target

52
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,750
level of expected return, find the one

53
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,210
with the lowest variance.

54
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,680
Formally, we need to solve the following optimization problem.

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,310
Minimize the variance of the portfolio return, which

56
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,210
is given by the sum across all pairs of assets,

57
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,700
of their return co-variance scaled

58
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,920
by the product of the corresponding portfolio

59
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,740
weights.

60
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,160
We impose two constraints.

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,730
First, portfolio weights must add up to one.

62
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,190
Second, the expected return on the portfolio,

63
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,550
which is a weighted average of individual asset

64
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,290
expected returns must equal the target level of portfolio

65
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,540
expected return.

66
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,490
As we discuss the portfolio choice problem,

67
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,120
we will use several examples, based on historical asset

68
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,710
returns.

69
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,880
In our examples, we use ETFs as risky assets.

70
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,730
Economically, each ETF on our list

71
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,720
represents an exposure to a distinct asset class.

72
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,330
Equities, high grade bonds, high yield bonds, gold,

73
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,650
and real estate.

74
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,330
All of these ETFs are US focused.

75
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,000
