1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,733
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will find

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:04,320
the market value of ABC's debt.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,170
Recall that, next year, in year one,

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,950
ABC's debt value will either be $5 million in the bad state

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,190
or $20 million in the good state.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,770
Let's contrast these payoffs with the payoffs

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,330
to the risk-free debt.

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,935
If ABC's debt was risk free, it would have paid $20 million

9
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:25,620
in both good and bad states.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,730
Let me introduce a default put option.

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,690
This option compensates the holder of risky debt

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,340
for the value lost in the event of default. In our case,

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,360
this default put option will pay $15 million in the bad state

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,730
so that the value of assets plus the payoff from this option

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,056
would equal to the face value of the loan, which is $20 million.

16
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:53,230
Based on this, we can derive the key insight.

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,100
The current value of ABC's debt should equal the current value

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,110
of $20 million, face-value, risk-free debt, minus the value

19
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,540
of what we called the default put option,

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,290
an option that pays $15 million in the bad state

21
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,660
and $0 in the good state.

22
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,570
Now we need to price the default put option.

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,850
To do this, we will compare the payoffs

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,060
that we get from this default put option with the payoffs

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,480
that we get from the put option written on the stock.

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,190
Recall that we had an option traded

27
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,470
in the market with a strike price of $7.

28
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,970
Remember that, in the bad state, the share price will be $0,

29
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,460
and, in the good state, it will be $10.

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,070
Therefore, this put option written on the stock

31
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,575
will pay $0 in the good state, and it

32
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:41,500
will pay $7 in the bad state.

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,590
Similar to the way we priced equity in the previous video,

34
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,360
let's contrast the payoffs of the default put option

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,460
and the put option written on the stock.

36
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,835
In the bad state, the default put option pays $15 million,

37
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:58,090
and the put option on the stock pays $7.

38
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,600
In the good state, both of them pay $0.

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,110
Based on this, we can derive the key insight.

40
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,979
The value of the default put option should equal 15 million

41
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,810
divided by 7 times the value of the $7 strike put

42
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,700
option on the stock.

43
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,060
Recall that the value of this $7 strike put option written

44
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,450
on the stock was $2.52.

45
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,270
Therefore, the value of the default put option

46
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,825
is $5.4 million.

47
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:31,430
Putting it all together, we can find the value

48
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,015
of ABC's debt right now.

49
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:35,390
It's going to be the present value of the risk-free debt,

50
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,800
which is $20 million--

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,550
this is because the risk-free rate is 0%--

52
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,410
minus the value of the default put

53
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,440
option, which is $5.4 million.

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,480
This gives us the value of ABC's debt.

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,910
That equals $14.6 million.

56
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,992
Notice something very interesting.

57
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:55,700
The yield to maturity on this bond, which

58
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,550
we can compute by taking the face value of this loan,

59
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,890
$20 million, divided by its current market value,

60
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,620
which is 14.6 minus 1, will be 37%.

61
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,830
Even though the risk-free rate in this economy is 0%,

62
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,340
the yield to maturity on this bond is 37%.

63
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,800
This high yield to maturity is explained by the fact

64
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,950
that, in the event of default, the holder of this loan

65
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,120
loses $15 million out of $20 million face value.

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,070
And, therefore, the high YTM captures the risk of this loss.

67
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,080
We will further explore this topic

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,950
in the second part of this course.
