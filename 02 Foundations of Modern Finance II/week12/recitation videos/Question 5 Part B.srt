1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,120
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will use a binomial tree

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,700
to price a European put option.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,770
This put option is similar to the call option

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,630
that we priced in the previous video.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,990
It has the same strike price of $120,

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,420
and it expires two years from now.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,930
First, let's draw a tree that captures the payoffs

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,460
from this put option.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,690
Recall that in the up-up state, the share price is $150.

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,050
Therefore, this put option expires out of the money,

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,320
and pay off from this option is $0.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,400
In the up-down state and when the share price is $60,

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,980
this put option expires in the money,

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,610
and therefore, our payoff is $60.

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,430
In the down-up state, the share price is $125.

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,630
Therefore, this put option expires out of the money.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,440
And in the down-down state, the share price is $20.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,900
The strike price of this put option is $120.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,890
Therefore, our pay off is $100.

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,930
Let's first find prices of this put option

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,810
in the up and down states in year one,

22
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,000
which we'll denote as Pu and Pd, respectively.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,090
And then we will find the price of this put option today,

24
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,370
which we'll denote as P0.

25
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,190
We will use the same portfolio replication approach

26
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,770
as we used to price the call option.

27
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,850
In year 1, in the up state, replicating portfolio approach

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,820
gives us the following two equations.

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,710
Solving these two equations, we obtain

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,120
the value of a as negative 0.667 and the value

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,750
of b, positive $96.62.

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,390
Let me highlight an important result here.

33
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,300
Notice that the value of a is negative and the value of b

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,930
is positive.

35
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,670
Recall that when we were pricing a call option, the value of a

36
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,570
was always positive, and the value of b was negative.

37
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,360
What does this mean economically?

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,750
It means that to replicate a put option,

39
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,350
we need to short 0.667 units of the underlying stock,

40
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,680
and we need to lend $96.62 at the risk-free rate.

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,440
In contrast, to replicate a call option,

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,650
we had to buy the underlying stock

43
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,840
and borrow at the risk-free rate.

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,880
The price of the put option must equal

45
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,520
to the value of the replicating portfolio in the year 1

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,230
in the up state, which equals to $13.29.

47
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,930
Repeating these steps, we can obtain the price

48
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,660
of the put option in year 1 in the down state,

49
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,860
which equals to $43.59.

50
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,040
Having priced this put option in the up and down states

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,950
in the year 1, we can finally turn to pricing

52
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,560
this option in year 0.

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,290
We obtain the following system of equations

54
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,080
from our replicating portfolio approach, and solving it,

55
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,840
we obtain the following values for a and b.

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Putting this all together, we get the following price

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,840
of the put option in the year 0, which equals to $25.43.

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,010
Let's summarize by drawing a tree that captures the price

59
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,200
evolution of this put option.

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,440
Its current price is $25.43.

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,090
Next year, if the share price goes up,

62
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,500
the price of this put option drops to $13.29.

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,810
Then, if the share price goes up again,

64
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,760
this put expires out of the money and pays off $0.

65
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,300
If the share price goes down, this put expires in the money

66
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,300
and pays off $60.

67
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,840
If, on the other hand, the first year the share price goes down,

68
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,220
the price of this put option increases to $43.59.

69
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,470
If, after that, the share price goes up,

70
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,850
this option expires out of the money and pays off $0.

71
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,700
If, on the other hand, the share price goes down again,

72
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,800
this put expires in the money and pays off $100.

73
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,040
Some of you might have thought of an alternative

74
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,190
and much faster approach to solving this problem.

75
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,760
We have already priced the call option.

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,720
And therefore, we can use the put-call parity

77
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,830
to price this put option.

78
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,490
Notice that, since we're given the effective annual rate

79
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,459
and not the continuously compounded APR,

80
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,910
I'm writing down the put-call parity in the following form

81
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,780
where the present value of strike K at the risk-free rate

82
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,480
is just K divided by 1 plus r raised to of power of T.

83
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,380
So let's use this equation to find the put price.

84
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,900
It will equal to 120, which is the strike price divided

85
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,840
by 1 plus 3.5%, which is the risk-free rate raised

86
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,940
to power of 2 because our option expires two years from now.

87
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,160
The price of the corresponding call option

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,820
is 13.41, which we found using the binomial tree

89
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,350
approach, minus $100, which is the current share price.

90
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,570
This gives us the price of this put option of $25.43, which

91
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,710
equals exactly what we obtained using the binomial tree pricing

92
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,940
approach.

93
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,510
Overall, the put-call parity demonstrates

94
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,600
that the prices of the call and the put options that we

95
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,210
obtained using the binomial pricing approach

96
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,700
are consistent.
