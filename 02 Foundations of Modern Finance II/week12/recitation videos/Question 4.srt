00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:01,890
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will demonstrate

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,370
that, if the put-call parity for European options does not hold,

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,510
this will create arbitrage opportunities in the market.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,490
Suppose that you observe the following prices

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,040
of financial instruments in the market.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,379
There is a stock, XYZ, that currently

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,780
trades at $20 a share.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,050
There is a European put option on XYZ with one-year maturity

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,474
and a strike price of $18, and it sells for $3.33.

10
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:31,170
There is also a European call option on the same stock, XYZ.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,340
It also has a maturity of one year and a strike price of $18.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,280
And it sells for $7.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,740
Suppose that the continuously compounded risk-free rate

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,090
is 8%.

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,220
The question asks if there is an arbitrage

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,410
opportunity in this market.

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,400
If there is, it asks to describe a trading strategy designed

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,710
to profit from this opportunity.

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,550
Let's examine whether the put-call parity holds.

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,490
The price of the call option plus the present value

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,960
of strike K equals to $23.62.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,360
Recall that 8% is continuously compounded.

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,630
Therefore, to compute the present value of $18,

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,270
we're multiplying it by exponent raised

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,820
to the power of negative 8%.

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,290
Capital T here equals to 1 because both of these options

27
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,350
mature in one year.

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,260
Second, the price of the put plus the price of the stock

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,690
equals to $23.33.

30
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,880
We can see that the put-call parity does not

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,580
hold because the price of the call plus the present value

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,670
of K is greater than the price of the put

33
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,230
plus the price of the stock.

34
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,320
What can we do to exploit this mispricing?

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,870
As always, when it comes to arbitrage,

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,450
we should buy what is cheap and sell what is expensive.

37
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,670
Therefore, we should buy the put at $3.33.

38
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,950
We should buy the stock at $20.

39
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,830
We should sell the call at $7, and we

40
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,320
should borrow the amount highlighted here in red--

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,380
this is just the present value of $18--

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,450
at the risk-free rate, 8%.

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,500
Therefore, a year from now, we need to pay back $18.

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,539
These transactions generate the immediate profit of $0.29.

45
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,120
Now let's see what happens a year from now.

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,230
Suppose that the share price one year from now is above $18.

47
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,690
We will denote this share price by S cap

48
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,130
T. This means that call expires in the money,

49
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,550
and put expires out of the money.

50
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,700
Therefore, you need to deliver S cap T minus 18

51
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,820
to the counterparty to whom you sold the call,

52
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,750
and you also need to repay the loan of $18.

53
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,550
To do this, you will do the following.

54
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,550
You will first sell this share at S cap T. Second,

55
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,340
you will pay S cap T minus 18 to the holder of the call option.

56
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,670
And, third, you will repay the loan of $18.

57
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,430
You can see that, regardless of the value of S_T,

58
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,150
you have just enough to pay to the holder of the option

59
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,680
and to repay the loan.

60
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,580
Therefore, your position a year from now is covered.

61
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,310
Now let's see what happens a year from now if the share

62
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,340
price ends up being below $18.

63
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,470
This means that the put expires in the money,

64
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,840
and the call expires out of the money,

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,360
and it doesn't get exercised, which

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,610
means that your only obligation a year from now

67
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,210
is to repay the loan of $18.

68
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,800
To do this, you will do the following.

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,170
First, you will sell the share and get S cap T. Second,

70
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,820
you will exercise the put option and collect 18 minus cap S_T.

71
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,380
You can see that the total proceeds

72
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,350
from the sale of the share and from exercise of the put option

73
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,510
equal exactly $18, regardless of what the future share price is.

74
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,190
And this gives you exactly enough

75
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,860
to repay your $18 loan, which means

76
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,650
that your position a year from now is covered.

77
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,990
To summarize, we have demonstrated

78
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,540
that if the put-call parity does not hold,

79
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,880
this creates an arbitrage opportunity

80
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,620
with immediate profits and no future risks.
