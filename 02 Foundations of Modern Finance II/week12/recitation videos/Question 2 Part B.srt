0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600


1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,170
PROFESSOR: All right, so this is our portfolio of the options

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,460
that we think should represent this payoff.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,240
Let's verify that.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,520
So, for each of these options, I've written down the payoff.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,370
So I'm starting from the bottom, so long four

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,920
puts with a strike price of 10.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,880
This is their payoffs.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,700
So, four of these options, each of them,

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,150
the payoff is 10 minus s because this is a put option,

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,410
and we'll long it.

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,210
And so this happens when the stock price

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,490
is between 0 and 10.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,760
And, if the stock price is above 10, the payoff from these puts

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,320
would be 0.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,640
Now then we are short one put with a strike price of 20.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,240
So, therefore, it's negative 20 minus s.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,050
So this is just the payoff from being short one put.

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,230
And we get this, if the share price is between 0 and 20,

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,690
and 0 otherwise.

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,710
Then, next, we'll long three puts with a strike price of 30.

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,240
So the payoff is 3 times 30 minus

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,860
s if the share price ends up being between 0 and 30, and 0

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,970
otherwise.

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,610
And, finally, we have two long call options.

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,400
And we get 0 if the share price is between 0 and 40.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,430
So these calls have strike of 40.

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,940
And we get 2 times s minus 40. s minus 40

28
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,085
is the payoff from each individual call option.

29
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:29,210
And so we have two of them.

30
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,280
So it's 2 times s minus 40 if the share price ends up

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,890
being above the strike price of $40.

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,850
So all we need to do is that we need to add up these, again,

33
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,780
piecewise functions and make sure that what we have here

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,050
is exactly what we have here in the green color.

35
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,770
So let's do that.

36
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,670
I will start to add up these four functions

37
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,880
by assuming that s is above 40, and then I

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,950
will go into these domains--

39
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,910
30 to 40, 20 to 30, 10 to 20, and 0 to 10.

40
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:07,330
So, if the stock price is above 40, we only get 2 times

41
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,850
s minus 40 right here, and we get 0 from the other three

42
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,420
types of options.

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,170
So, for this particular case, if s is above 40,

44
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,473
we get 2s minus 80 as our payoff.

45
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:24,390
And you can see that we're off to a good start

46
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,932
because this actually matches to what

47
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:29,710
was given to us in this problem in the very beginning.

48
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,610
Now what is our payoff if the stock

49
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,540
price is between 30 and 40?

50
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,920


51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,440
So you could see that the option at the bottom

52
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,150
pays nothing because, if it's 30 to 40, we get 0 here.

53
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,040
And all of these other options, if s

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,690
is above 30, 20, and 10, so they also give us $0.

55
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,070
So, in this part of the share price domain, so 30 to 40,

56
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,060
we get $0 payoff.

57
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,830
And, again, it matches to what we were

58
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,050
given in the very beginning.

59
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:12,600
Now, if the share price is between 20 and 30,

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,180
we get nothing from the bottom option,

61
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,087
but we do get something from this third type of options.

62
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:23,670
And we get nothing from the other two.

63
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,087
So, if the share price is above 20

64
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:28,000
and above 10 and, in our domain, 20 to 30,

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,240
so these options give us 0.

66
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,790
This option gives us 0 as well, but this gives us something.

67
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,780
So it gives us 3 times 30 minus s.

68
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:42,560
And so, together, we get-- so this is 90 minus 3s.

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,870
And, again, so this matches to what

70
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,790
we were given here as well.

71
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,290
Now what about in the 10 to 20 range?

72
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,710
So the share price is between 10 and 20.

73
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,610
We get the payoff from this second type of options

74
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,130
and, actually, the third and the second one as well.

75
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,490
So we get negative 20 minus s.

76
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,180
Plus we get 3 times 30 minus s.

77
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,600
So let's put this together-- so negative

78
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,320
20 minus s plus 3 times 30 minus s.

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,250
So, if I were to add this up, I get so minus 20 plus 90.

80
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,020
So this is 70.

81
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,230
And then I get minus 3s plus s.

82
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,140
So this is minus 2s.

83
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,247
And so then, in this domain, because this type of options

84
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,080
pays off something, and this type of options

85
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,590
pays something off as well, so, in this range of 10 to 20,

86
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,950
we get 70 minus 2s.

87
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,070
Now, if we compare this to what we're given in this question,

88
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,280
it's going to, again, match precisely what we're given.

89
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,940
So here, from this collection of options

90
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,260
in this particular range, we get exactly the same payoff

91
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,350
as the function that we were given in the very beginning.

92
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,140
Finally-- and I will continue writing here.

93
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,870
So in this domain of--

94
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,370
so, when s is between 0 and 10, what we get

95
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,640
is that the first three type of options.

96
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,068
So you can see that we get some payoff from the first one,

97
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:25,610
we get something from the second one,

98
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,610
and we get something from the third one as well.

99
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,470
So we have to add up this, this, and that.

100
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,670
And this would be our payoff in this particular domain.

101
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:44,560
So we get 40 minus 4s, 4s.

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,170
Then we get negative minus 20 plus s.

103
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:55,200
And then we get 90 minus 3s.

104
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,990
And so we're going to-- if we're going to add this up, so 40

105
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,400
minus 20 plus 90, this is 110.

106
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,110
And we get negative 4s plus s minus 3s.

107
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,060
So this is minus 6s.

108
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,910
And so this will match, again, exactly what

109
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,035
we're given in the problem.

110
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:18,490
So, in this range, when s is between 0 and 10,

111
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,650
this collection of options give us 110 minus 6s.

112
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,420
So, therefore, what we've just proven here

113
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,010
by doing this exercise, we've proven

114
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,998
that the collection-- the portfolio

115
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:32,290
of these options and these positions and these options,

116
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,990
so long two calls at $40, long three puts at $30,

117
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,560
short one put at $20 strike price, and long four puts

118
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,380
at $10, so this portfolio of options

119
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,300
gave us exactly this payoff.
