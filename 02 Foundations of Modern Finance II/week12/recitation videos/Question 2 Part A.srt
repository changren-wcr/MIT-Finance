1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:02,400
PROFESSOR: We're given the following payoff function

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,830
as the function of s, which is the stock price.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,800
So these are the different payoffs,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,180
depending on the realization of the stock price,

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,300
S. So this question asks us to draw the payoff diagram

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,480
and to represent this payoff as a portfolio of European put

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,860
and call options.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,270
Now let's first draw this diagram and see how many

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,800
and of what kind of options we need to construct this payoff.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,280
I'm going to start on the right-hand side here,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,445
and we'll put 40 as the stock price here.

12
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:41,820
And the reason I'm starting there

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,740
because this payoff at the bottom here looks familiar.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,500
So it's 2s minus 80.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,520
So you can think of it as just simply two call options

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,080
with a strike price of 40 because each call option

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,720
with the strike price of 40 would give you

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,180
a payoff of s minus 40.

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,980
So two of them is going to be 2s minus 80.

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,980
So this is the function right here, so 2s minus 80,

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,730
and this is my first starting point.

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:24,640
So I need two calls with a strike price of $40 each.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:32,340
Then it gets flat line or zero payoff between 30 and 40.

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,200
And, between 20 and 30, it gets 90 minus 3s.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,270
So, first of all, since I have minus 3s,

26
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,850
it means that I need three options and three put options

27
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,230
because this is a negative slope.

28
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,300
So, if I get three put options with the strike price of 30,

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,010
the payoff from this is going to be 90 minus 3s because again--

30
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,910
so, if I get one put option with a strike price of 30,

31
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,000
the payoff from that option will be 30 minus s.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,990
So 3 times that would be 90 minus 3s.

33
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,980
So, therefore, this is the function that I will get here.

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:19,880
So I need three puts with the strike price of 30.

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,390
Now, next, notice that, this breakpoint of $20, the slope

36
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,510
becomes less steep.

37
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,760
So we get from negative 3s to negative 2s.

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,360
So what it effectively means is that here, when we reach 20,

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,220
we need to short or sell one put option so that our slope goes

40
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,650
from 3s to 2s.

41
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,910
So I'll say that we are buying, or we are long this first set

42
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,890
of options so far.

43
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:06,230
At this point, we are short one put with a strike price of $20.

44
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,070
So this gives us a little bit steeper slope right here.

45
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,150
So here we have the slope of 3.

46
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,930
Here we have the slope of 2, so two options, three options.

47
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,400
And here the slope will be 2.

48
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,350
Now, finally, when we reach 10 right here,

49
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,360
so this break point, the slope goes from negative 2

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,680
to negative 6.

51
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,750
So it means that we need to long another four

52
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:54,170
options with the strike price of 10, so long four puts

53
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,640
with the strike price of 10.

54
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,230
And so this is going to make this line very, very steep.

55
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,450
And so the slope of this line is 6.

56
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,440
Now what we need to verify is that this line actually

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,740
intersects the y-axis at 110 because you

58
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,019
can see that, when s equals to 0, this has to be equal to 110.

59
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,012
So what I will do next is that I will

60
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,470
take the portfolio of these options

61
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,070
that we constructed right now and taken

62
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,860
to construct this graph, and I will write the payoff

63
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,050
for each of them.

64
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,120
And I will add them all up just to make sure

65
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,580
that we get 110 as the intersection point

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,040
and, therefore, the correct representation,

67
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,950
the correct graph, that represents this payoff

68
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,500
function.
