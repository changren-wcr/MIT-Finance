1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,150
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will review binomial option

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,750
pricing model.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,200
Suppose that there is a stock with a current share

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,780
price of $100.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,180
The graph on the slide shows the evolution of the share

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,550
price over the next two years.

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,090
It can become either $125 or $75 a year from now.

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,310
If it was $125, it can grow to $150 in year two

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,920
or can go down to $60.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,400
If it was $75, it can grow to $125, or it can go down to $20.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,760
Now suppose that the risk-free rate is 3.5%.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,883
We will assume that this is an effective annual rate.

13
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:40,800
We will also assume that there is no arbitrage

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,383
and that investors can borrow and lend

15
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:45,570
at this risk-free rate of 3.5%.

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,060
We are asked to compute the current price

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,320
of a European call option that expires two years from now

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,480
and has a strike price of $120 per share.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,330
Let's start by creating a tree that

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,140
shows the payoffs from this option at the end of year two.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,430
If the share price is $150 and since this is a call option

22
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,880
and has a strike price of $120, our payoff,

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,150
as the holder of this option, would be $30.

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,970
In the up-down state, when the share price is $60,

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,730
this option expires out of the money.

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,910
And, therefore, our payoff is $0.

27
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,540
In the down-up state, the share price is $125,

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,900
and, therefore, our payoff is $5.

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,010
And, in the down-down state, the share price is $20.

30
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,340
Therefore, again, this option expires out of the money.

31
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,320
And, therefore, our payoff is $0.

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,420
Let's start by pricing the option

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,970
in year one in the up state.

34
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,070
We will create the replicating portfolio

35
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,280
that has a shares of the stock and b dollars

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,670
of the riskless bond that replicates the payoff

37
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,770
from this option in year two.

38
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,620
So, therefore, we have the following two equations--

39
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,730
150, which is the price of a share in the up-up state,

40
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,509
times the number of shares, a, plus 1

41
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,520
plus the risk-free rate of 3.5%, which gives us 1.035,

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,760
multiplied by b dollars that we originally

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,100
invested in the riskless bond.

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,370
That should be equal to $30, which is our option

45
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,040
payoff in the up-up state.

46
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,560
The second equation equates the payoff

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,260
from the replicating portfolio and the payoff

48
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,440
from the option in the up-down state.

49
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,330
In the up-down state, the share price is $60,

50
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,840
and we have a units of the share.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,540
Therefore, our total payoff is 60 times a plus, again,

52
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,660
1 plus the risk-free rate of 3.5% times

53
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,330
b, which is the initial amount of dollars

54
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,130
that we invested in the riskless bond.

55
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,920
And that should equal to 0 because 0 is the payoff

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,470
that we get from the option in the up-down state.

57
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,490
Solving this system gives us the following values for a and b.

58
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,910
Notice that the value of a is positive, and the value of b

59
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,150
is negative.

60
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,300
This means that, to replicate the option, we

61
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,250
need to buy one third of a share and borrow

62
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,360
$19.32 at the risk-free rate.

63
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,600
The value of this call option in year one in the up state

64
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,840
would equal to the value of this replicating portfolio.

65
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,710
Recall that the share price in this up state is $125.

66
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,980
Therefore, the total value of this replicating portfolio

67
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,290
is $22.34.

68
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,710
Next, we follow exactly the same steps

69
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,365
to find the price of the option in the down state in year one.

70
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:42,740
The following system of equations

71
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,060
gives us the replicating portfolio of a shares

72
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,790
and b dollars of riskless bond.

73
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,970
Solving this system of equations gives us the following values.

74
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,970
And, therefore, the option price in the down state is $2.65.

75
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,310
The final step is to price this option in year zero.

76
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,970
This tree shows you the prices of this option

77
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,730
in the up state in year one and the down state in year one

78
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,530
as well.

79
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,610
Again, we're constructing a replicating portfolio

80
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,380
that consists of a shares of the stock

81
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,600
and b dollars of the riskless bond that

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,190
replicates the payoffs of this option in year one.

83
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,829
Solving this system for a and b, we can price this option

84
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,510
and find that its price in year zero is $13.41.

85
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,570
This tree summarizes the evolution of this option price.

86
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,670
Its current price is $13.41.

87
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,950
If the share price goes up, the option price

88
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,260
increases to $22.34.

89
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,060
If the share price goes up again,

90
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,270
this option expires in the money and pays off $30.

91
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,460
If the share price goes down, this option

92
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,130
expires out of the money and pays off $0.

93
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,500
If the share price in year one goes down,

94
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,050
the option price goes down to $2.65.

95
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,720
And, if the share price goes up, this option

96
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,600
expires in the money and pays off $5.

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,400
And, if the share price goes down,

98
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,340
this option expires out of the money and pays off $0.
