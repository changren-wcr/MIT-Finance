1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,260
PROFESSOR: Now, next, let's construct a payoff diagram

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,850
from the following portfolio.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,020
We're going to short two puts with a strike price of $90.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,880
And we're going to long one call with a strike price of $110.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,610
So what I've written here are the payoffs

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,310
to shorting two puts.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,527
So, if we short two puts, we get the negative

8
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:28,110
of what we would have gotten if we actually are long these two

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:28,610
puts.

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:34,620
So we get negative 180 plus 2 s1 if s1 ends up being 90.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,620
And we get 0 because the options--

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,500
these two options would expire out of the money

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,390
if s1 is above 90.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,480
And, the payoff from the call option, one call option,

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,230
is simply s1 minus 110, which is the strike price of this one

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,850
call, if s1 ends up being above 110 and 0

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,570
if the stock price is below 110.

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,640
So now we will add up these two payoff functions,

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,040
and we'll get the payoff of our portfolio.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,240
So let me make a remark that what we're doing here

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,580
is just a very universal approach where

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,110
you can find the payoff of a portfolio of any types

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,580
and however many different kinds of options you actually have.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,470
So, if you have discipline of writing down

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,150
the payoffs for individual options

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,700
and then add them up piecewise, you

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,310
will always get the right answer.

28
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,970
The more you practice with this, the more clear it will be.

29
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,593
For example, at some point, it's going

30
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:37,260
to be very clear to you, without writing

31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,960
these mathematical expressions, how the payoff

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,160
diagram for this portfolio would look like,

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,115
but this would come only with practice.

34
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:45,990
And a good practice is to have the discipline

35
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,800
of writing down the payoffs and actually adding them up.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,390
Now so we have this payoff.

37
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,260
We have this payoff.

38
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,310
Let's add them up.

39
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,910
So, if the stock price is below-- so let's

40
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,850
always start with sort of the lower part.

41
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,570
So, if the stock price ends up being somewhere below 90,

42
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,780
then we get this much from these two puts.

43
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,120
And we get nothing from the call.

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:22,860
So we get negative 180 plus 2 s1 if s1 is less or equal than 90.

45
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,170
Then, if s1 is above 90, but below 110, we

46
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,690
get 0 payoff from the two puts, and we also get,

47
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,060
actually, 0 payoff from call.

48
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:46,470
So we get 0 if s1 is above 90 and below 110.

49
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,150
And then, once we're crossing 110, so if s1 is above 110,

50
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,210
we get nothing from the two puts, and we get s1 minus 110

51
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,040
from the call.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:10,490
So, in this part, we get s1 minus 110 if s1 is above 110.

53
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,010
Let me also make another minor remark

54
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,620
that where exactly I put the equality

55
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,260
signs in these expressions does not matter because,

56
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,620
all of these functions, they are continuous in the sense

57
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,240
that there are no breaks.

58
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,960
So, therefore, if I put, for example, equality, instead

59
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,320
of here, here, the end result would not

60
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,140
change because, again, you have continuity in all of these--

61
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,880
in all of these breakpoints.

62
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,790
Now the final step is to draw this mathematical expression

63
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,680
in the form of a diagram.

64
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,490
I'm going to start from the left-hand side.

65
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:52,250
So, if s1 is 0, then we get negative $180, the payoff.

66
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,490
So I'm going to start from here, negative 180.

67
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:00,680
And then, if s1 equals to 90, then we're

68
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,880
going to get 0 payoff because it's going to be negative 180

69
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,290
plus 2 times 90.

70
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,430
That's going to be 0.

71
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,630
And we could also see that we have 0 here.

72
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,700
So, if s1 equals to 90, we get 0 here as well.

73
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,558
So we're getting-- so this is 90.

74
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,600
We're getting this point.

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,470
And so this is the line that goes straight line

76
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,380
from negative 180 to 90.

77
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,630
The slope of this line, you could see that it's also--

78
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:34,550
so this part is 2 because we have two of these puts.

79
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,990
And then we get--

80
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:44,550
then our payoff is 0 from 90 to 110.

81
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,880
And, from this point onwards, from 110 and above, our payoff

82
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,140
is s1 minus 110.

83
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,060
So this is the line that will look like this.

84
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,600


85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,330
And so the slope of this line is 45 degrees.

86
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,570
So this raise is 1.

87
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,420
And so this is how our combined payoff from the strategy

88
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,530
is going to look like.

89
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,870
And, in fact, so, if you look at this,

90
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,420
you realize that this is really just a combination,

91
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,640
a simple combination, of two short puts here at the bottom.

92
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,920
And then you have one long call option

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,410
with a strike price of 110.

94
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,300
So, therefore, you're staring at negative 180 all the way to 0

95
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,950
when s1 equals to 90.

96
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,090
Then it's 0.

97
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,620
Then it's in the positive domain when s1 goes above $110.

98
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,240
So this is the payoff diagram for this question.
