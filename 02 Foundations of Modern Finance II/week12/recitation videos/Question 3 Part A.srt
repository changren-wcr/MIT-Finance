00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:01,530
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,970
learn how prices of options written on a firm's stock

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,189
are, in theory, related to the values of corporate securities

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,800
such as equity and debt.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,070
ABC Corporation is an educational technology startup,

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,970
which has 500,000 shares outstanding.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,180
Next year, the value of ABC's assets

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,870
can either be $25 million or $5 million,

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,570
depending on the market adoption of early childhood development

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,620
applications.

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,500
ABC has a $20 million face value bank

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,960
loan due in one year from now.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,540
There are two options on ABC stock currently traded

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,680
in the market.

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,850
A call option with one-year maturity and $7 strike price is

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,970
traded at $1.50 per option.

17
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,580
A put option with one-year maturity

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,370
and also a $7 strike price is traded at $2.52 per option.

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,520
Suppose the current one-year, risk-free rate is 0%.

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,590
We will use information given to us

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,590
to find the current market values of ABC's equity

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,640
and debt.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,080
Let's start solving this question

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,140
by figuring out what would be the value of assets, debt,

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,200
and equity of this firm in year one,

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,240
as well as what would be the share

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,400
price of this firm in year one.

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,830
This table shows you that there are two states.

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,800
Next year, it can be bad state or can be good state.

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,290
In the bad state, recall that the assets of the firm

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,530
will be worth $5 million, and, in the good state,

32
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,910
they are worth $25 million.

33
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,900
What would be the value of debt in year one?

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,825
Recall that the face value of this loan is $20 million.

35
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:37,530
In the good state, the firm's assets are worth $25 million.

36
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,040
And, therefore, the firm has enough to repay this debt.

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,500
In the bad state, however, the value of assets

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,560
is not sufficient to pay this debt in full.

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,030
And, therefore, the firm has to default on its debt obligation.

40
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,210
Therefore, the value of debt in this bad state of the world

41
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,750
is only $5 million, which equals to the value of assets

42
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,490
of the firm.

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,260
The value of equity will be whatever is

44
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,780
left after we repay the loan.

45
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,075
In the good state, it is $5 million.

46
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,009
In the bad state, it is $0 because we

47
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,870
defaulted on our loan.

48
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,450
Finally, we can compute the share price

49
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,300
by dividing the value of equity by the total number of shares

50
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,410
outstanding.

51
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,500
In the bad state, the share price will be $0.

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,810
In the good state, it will be $5 million

53
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,550
divided by 500,000 shares outstanding,

54
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,760
which gives us $10 a share.

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,360
Now we know what share price will be in year one.

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,940
But what is the current share price?

57
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,660
Let's use current option prices to impute the current share

58
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,020
price.

59
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,880
Let's compare the values of one share

60
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,340
and one call option in year one.

61
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,800
Recall that the call option has $7 strike price.

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,790
Therefore, in the bad state, when the share price is $0,

63
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,150
the payoff and, hence, the value of the call option will be $0.

64
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,490
In the good state, however, the value of the call option

65
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,800
will be $3.

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,700
Based on this table, we can arrive to the key insight.

67
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,270
Since this share always pays 10/3 times more

68
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,360
compared to the call option, the price of the share today

69
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
should be 10/3 times higher than the price of the call option

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,460
today.

71
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,700
Recall that the price of the call option is $1.50.

72
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,620
So, therefore, the share price is

73
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,780
10 divided by 3 times 1.5, which gives us $5 a share.

74
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,600
Now we can compute the total market

75
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,730
value of equity of this firm.

76
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,007
Since this firm has 500,000 shares outstanding,

77
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,590
the total market value of equity would

78
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,370
be $5, which is the share price, times the number of shares,

79
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,500
which gives us $2.5 million.

80
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,000
