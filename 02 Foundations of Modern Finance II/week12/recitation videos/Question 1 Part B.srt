00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600


1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,850
PROFESSOR: Now let's draw the payoff diagram that

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,280
corresponds to this payoff.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,320
So let's start with when s1 equals to 0.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,160
So, when s1 equals to 0, we get our payoff is $200.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,370
Now, if s1 ends up being $90, our payoff,

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,550
according to this expression, is going to be 200 minus 2

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,050
times 90, which is 180.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,220
So 200 minus 180 would be $20.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:39,300
So, therefore, we're getting $20 if the stock price ends up

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,100
being $90.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,330
So, therefore, this would be the first part of this diagram

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,490
where we get this line.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,150
So, because we have minus 2 s1 here, so the raise here

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,650
and, therefore, the slope of this line is 2.

15
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,480
Now so this is the first part.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,629
Now, if s1 is above 90 but below 110--

17
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,850
let's put 110 here--

18
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,250
then our payoff is going to be 110 minus s1.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,030
So, if s1 is just exactly 90, so this function is still--

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,400
would equal to 20.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,410
So, therefore, we don't have any breaks here.

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,800
So we're going to start exactly at this point.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,270
And then, if s1 goes all the way to 110,

24
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,090
then this payoff, this function, is going to be equal to 0.

25
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,900
So, therefore, the second part here

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,150
is just the straight line that connects these two points.

27
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,050


28
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,090
And then, of course, if the stock price

29
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,700
ends up being above 110, we get zero payoff here.

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,040
And so here, because we get 110 minus s1,

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,500
the slope of this line is negative 45 degrees.

32
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,970
And so there is here just 1.

33
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,610
So, therefore, this is how the total payoff

34
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,480
from this portfolio would look like.

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,860
So we get a steep line that starts at 200.

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,180
It goes down to 20 when s1 equals to 90.

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,510
Then it becomes less steep, and it goes to 110.

38
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,040
And then it becomes 0.

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,190
And, intuitively, of course, so the steepness here

40
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,740
comes from the fact that both of these options

41
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,240
expire in the money.

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,370
And, therefore, this is the payoff that we get.

43
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,030
So, once we cross the $90 threshold,

44
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,870
the first option expires out of the money,

45
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,820
and, therefore, we get nothing from it.

46
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,760
And we still get the payoff from the second option,

47
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,960
and this is its payoff.

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,070
And, when s1 goes above 110, we get zero payoff

49
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,430
from these two put options.

50
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,300
So, therefore, this is how the diagram

51
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,760
for this particular portfolio would look like.

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,305
Now let's consider the following.

53
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,510
So let's assume that you're an investor,

54
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,830
and you're buying one put option with a strike price of $90

55
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,570
and one put option with a strike price of $110.

56
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,450
What would be your payoff in this case?

57
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,610
Let's follow the same approach as we've done

58
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,010
in part a of this question.

59
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,380
I will write down the mathematical expressions

60
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,840
for the payoffs from these two put options,

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,240
and then I will mathematically add them up.

62
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,450
And then I will draw the diagram that corresponds

63
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,672
to this particular portfolio.

64
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:28,380
So let's start with the first put option.

65
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,070
So this put option has strike price of $90.

66
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,980
So, therefore, it pays off 90 minus s1 if s1 is below 90.

67
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,070
If s1 ends up being above 90, this option

68
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,940
expires out of the money, and it pays off 0.

69
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,340
Similar, for the second put option,

70
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,940
we get 110 minus s1 if s1 ends up

71
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,395
being below 110, which is the strike price, and 0 otherwise.

72
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:56,770
So what I will do right now is that I will mathematically

73
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,660
add up these two expressions.

74
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,600
So what we will end up having is that let's

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,430
first kind of mentally break down the domain of s1

76
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,360
into three pieces.

77
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,180
So it's above 110, between 90 and 110, and below 90.

78
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,250
So what happens if the stock price ends up being above $110?

79
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,290
Well, then, in this case, both of these options

80
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,970
expire out of the money, and our aggregate payoff

81
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,340
from both of these options is just 0.

82
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,610
So we get 0 if s1 is above $110.

83
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:44,560
Now what happens if s1 ends up being between 90 and 110?

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,710
Well, in this case, the first option still expires out

85
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,020
of the money, and exercising it becomes not optimal,

86
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,860
but the second option actually expires in the money.

87
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,480
And, therefore, we're exercising it,

88
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,770
and we're getting 110 minus s1 as the payoff from this option.

89
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:10,760
So, therefore, we get 0 plus 110 minus s1 or 110 minus s1

90
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:22,460
if s1 one ends up being above 90, but below 110.

91
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,740
And now, if the stock price ends up being below 90,

92
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,630
then, in this case, both of these options

93
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,160
expire in the money.

94
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,770
And our payoff becomes 90 minus s1 plus 110 minus s1.

95
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:45,410
So, adding these two up, we get 200 minus 2 s1

96
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:52,980
if s1 ends up being below 90.

97
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,870
So this is the combined payoff from holding these two options.

98
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,330
So we get 200 minus 2 s1 if the stock price is below 90.

99
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,680
We get 110 minus s1 if the stock price is between 90 and 110.

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,470
And we get 0 if the stock price is above 110.
