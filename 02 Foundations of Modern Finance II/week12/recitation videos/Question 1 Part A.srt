00:00:00,555 --> 00:00:02,430
PROFESSOR: In this question, I will teach you

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,270
how to draw payoff diagrams and understand

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,240
the payoffs of a portfolio of different options.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,073
This is a very useful application.

5
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:13,740
So let's consider the following example.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,810
We have a stock, ABC.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,420
Its current price is $90.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,990
And then we have four one-year options.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,232
Two of them are put options, and the remaining two

10
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,190
are call options.

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,010
The two put options have strikes $90 and $110.

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,930
And two call options have the same strikes, $90 and $110.

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,270
The first question asks us to draw

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,490
a payoff diagram for two puts and one bond

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,360
with a face value of $20.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,570
So think of-- see yourself as an investor who

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,340
buys these two puts with a strike of $90 and one bond

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,140
with a face value of $20.

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,270
Now what your payoff diagram would

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,860
look like in one year from now when these two puts expire?

21
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,220
Now let's first start with understanding

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,150
how the payoff from buying two put options with a strike

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,550
price of $90 would look like.

24
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,970
Recall that the payoff diagram from buying just one

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,310
put option with a strike price of $90

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,850
is going to look like this.

27
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,360
So we have a positive line that goes

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,130
at a negative 45-degree angle from 90 to 90,

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,160
and the payoff function looks like this.

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,730
So it's 90 minus s1.

31
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,880
s1 is the price of the underlying asset--

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,350
in this case, it's a stock--

33
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,710
at the expiry date, which is one year from now.

34
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,620
So, therefore, I denote it by just s1.

35
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,010
Recall that the current price of the stock

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,870
has nothing to do with this payoff diagram.

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,203
It's relevant, of course, for the pricing of the option,

38
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:47,460
but it's irrelevant for what would

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,340
be our payoff from buying this one put

40
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,700
and holding onto it for one year.

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,880
So this is just one put option.

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,030
Now what's going to be-- if we're

43
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,680
going to be buying two put options,

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,470
what would our payoff diagram look like?

45
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,910
Well, one way to figure this out is just

46
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,880
to mathematically multiply this payoff

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,330
that we get from one put option by 2

48
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,240
because, if we are buying two put options, therefore,

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,070
we would get twice the payoff.

50
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,330
So multiplying this by 2 would give us the following.

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,220
So the first part would be just 90 minus s1 multiplied by 2.

52
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,100
So it'll be 180 minus 2 s1--

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,030
and this is for the case when the share price ends up

54
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,730
being below 90, and, therefore, exercise becomes optimal--

55
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,890
or 0 otherwise if the share price ends up being higher

56
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,020
than the strike price.

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,380
Now, this is how, mathematically,

58
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,740
the payoff from buying two put options would look like.

59
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,260
And, graphically, if we were to graph this,

60
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,190
it would be just the line that starts, if s1 is 0,

61
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,630
this would be-- this function would be 180.

62
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,510
So it's the line that starts at 180.

63
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,130
It has a negative 2 slope, and it goes all the way down to 0.

64
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,050
So, if s1 equals to 90, this expression is 0.

65
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,140
So, 180 and 90 here, that's a straight line.

66
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,790
And then it goes at 0 if the share price ends up

67
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,230
being above $90.

68
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,980
So this raise here is 2, as opposed to,

69
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,310
when we have one put option here, it is just 1.

70
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,450
Now we can extend this and just generalize.

71
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,935
So, if we had three put options, we would get 270,

72
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:41,310
and this line would start at 270.

73
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,540
And it's going to go to 90 and then continue

74
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,580
being just a flat line at 0.

75
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,155
And any other number of put options

76
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:51,780
would just go all the way up, and we're

77
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,950
going to start at that.

78
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,740
For example, 10 put options is going to start at 900.

79
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,840
It's going to go down to 90.

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,540
And then it's going to be a zero line.

81
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,400
Once we figured out how the payoff

82
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,640
diagram from buying two puts looks like,

83
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,100
let's bring the bond back in.

84
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,820
So now this is the payoff that we get from buying a bond.

85
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,180
If we buy a bond that has a face value of $20,

86
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,800
it means that it pays off $20 to us at the end of year one.

87
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,120
We'll assume that it has one year to maturity, no coupon

88
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,710
payments.

89
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,500
So it's a zero coupon, $20 face-value bond.

90
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,390
So it pays $20 at the end of year one,

91
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,670
and it gives us this $20, irrespective of the price

92
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,490
of stock ABC in year one.

93
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,110
So, for any s1, this is just going to be 20.

94
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,990
So it's a flat line at 20.

95
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,590
So now we're constructing this portfolio

96
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,480
by buying these two puts and this one bond.

97
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,470
So, therefore, we need to add up this diagram with this diagram.

98
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,430
The easiest way to do that is to, first, start

99
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,130
mathematically, just looking at the mathematical expressions

100
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,190
for the payoff for the bond and payoff for the two

101
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,570
puts, and add them up.

102
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,340
So this is the payoff for the bond.

103
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,130
This is payoff for the two puts.

104
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,950
If we add them up, we are adding 20

105
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,470
and plus 180 minus 2 s1 if s1 is less than 90.

106
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,900
So this is going to be 200 minus 2 s1 for s1

107
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,580
less or equal than 90.

108
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,140
And, if s1 is above 90, it's going to be 20 plus 0.

109
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,830
So is going to be 20.

110
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,490
So, therefore, the combined payoff

111
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,980
from buying two puts and this bond

112
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,830
is going to be 200 minus 2 s1, if s1

113
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:51,430
is less than or equal to 90, and 20 if s1 is above 90.

114
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,620
Now so this is a mathematical expression.

115
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,560
All we have to do right now is to plot it.

116
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,240
Well, we can simply plot it just kind of piecewise

117
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,020
by starting at, for example, if s1 equals to 0,

118
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,820
then this payoff is going to be 200.

119
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,320
And, if s1 goes all the way to 90,

120
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,890
it means this payoff is going to be 200 minus 2 times 90.

121
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,370
This is 180.

122
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,170
So this will be just $20, somewhere here,

123
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,610
so at 20 and 90.

124
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,270
And then, all the way, if s1 ends up being above $90,

125
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,670
so this payoff is going to be $20 as well.

126
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:39,840
So it's $20 from here, from 90 and above, and starts at 200

127
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,650
and goes down to 90.

128
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,490
So this is the payoff diagram from buying two puts

129
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,250
with a strike price of $90 and buying one bond with a face

130
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,640
value of $20.
