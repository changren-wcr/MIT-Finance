PROFESSOR: We can think about many corporate securities

1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,640
as options.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,160
This perspective is very useful for understanding

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,440
the properties of corporate securities

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,390
and for developing models for the revelation.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,329
To highlight the main idea, consider a firm

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,680
with debt in its capital structure, a single bond.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,080
The market value of the firm's assets is $30.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,490
The face value of its bond is $50.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,920
We assume that the bond pays no coupons

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,320
and simply promises $50 at maturity.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,330
This firm may default. If its assets are worth less than $50

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,880
when the bond matures, the firm will

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,360
have to default on its debt.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,690
If that happens, bondholders will own the firm,

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,420
and the equity value will be zero.

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,030
Next, consider the value of firm's assets

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,210
and its equity in alternative scenarios.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,890
In particular, we compare the stock of the firm and a call

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,040
option on the underlying assets of the firm with the strike

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,740
price of $50, which is the promised amount of its debt.

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,080
Compare the second and the third columns in the table.

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,160
Note that the stock of the firm generates the same pay off

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,880
as a call option on its assets.

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,660
Equity is essentially a call option on the firm's assets.

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,350
Many corporate securities can be viewed as options.

26
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,240
We have just established that equity

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,350
is a call option on the firm's assets with the exercise price

28
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,020
equal to the face value of its debt.

29
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,010
Next, consider the firm's debt.

30
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,910
The payoff of that is equal to the firm's assets

31
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,520
minus the payoff of its equity.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,780
In other words, that is a portfolio

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,260
combining the firm's assets and the short position in the call

34
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,200
option on its assets with the exercise

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,370
price equal to the face value of its debt.

36
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,910
Warrants are closely related to call options

37
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,800
on the firm's stock.

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,290
What makes them different is that when the warrants are

39
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,070
exercised, new shares are issued, which dilutes

40
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,470
the value of the firm's shares.

41
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,530
This dilution effect must be taken into account

42
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,570
when valuing warrants.

43
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,300
Convertible bonds are bonds that can

44
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,210
be converted into equity at a prespecified conversion ratio.

45
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,630
Convertible bonds are similar to a portfolio combining

46
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,230
straight bonds and call options on the firm's stock

47
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,690
with the exercise price related to the conversion ratio.

48
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,890
A callable bond gives the issuer the right to buy the bond back

49
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,340
at a specified price.

50
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,930
From the perspective of the buyer,

51
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,490
a callable bond is a portfolio combining straight bonds

52
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,950
with a short position in a call written on these bonds.
