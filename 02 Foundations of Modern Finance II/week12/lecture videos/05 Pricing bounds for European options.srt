1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,420
PROFESSOR: We now use arbitrage arguments to develop

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,590
pricing bonds on options.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,630
These bonds are model free.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,030
We do not need to impose any restrictions

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,480
on the price process of the underlying asset.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,000
These bonds are important not only because

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,790
of their practical implications, but also

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,600
because they help us better understand how to use arbitrage

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,300
logic to value options.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,420
This is a stepping stone on the way

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,740
towards option-pricing models.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,990
We now introduce some notation, which

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,760
we will use for the rest of the lecture.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,240
For convenience, we refer to the underlying asset as the stock.

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,910
Of course, the underlying could also

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,660
be a bond, foreign currency, or some other asset.

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,690
S is the price of the stock now.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,400
S sub t is the price of the stock at time, t.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,960
B is the price of the discount bond, paying $1 at maturity

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,220
at time, t.

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,650
We maintain the assumption that interest rates are positive.

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,030
So the price of the bond is less than 1.

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,910
C denotes the price of a European call,

24
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,170
with the strike price, K and maturity,

25
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,150
T. P is the price of a European put,

26
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,070
with the strike price, K and maturity,

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,300
T. For now we consider only European options, which can

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,070
be exercised only at maturity.

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,370
We also assume that the underlying asset does not

30
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,530
pay dividends.

31
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,270
Consider the payoff for the option

32
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,900
when the option is exercised.

33
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,260
The resulting cash flow is called the exercise value

34
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,500
of the option.

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,960
For a call option, the exercise value

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,290
is the difference between the stock price and the strike

37
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,710
price.

38
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,410
For a put, the exercise value is the difference

39
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,770
between the strike and the stock price.

40
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,620
There is some terminology related to this.

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,350
We say that the option is in the money

42
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,450
if its exercised its value is positive.

43
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,919
An option is at the money if its exercise value is 0.

44
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,170
And the option is out of the money

45
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,440
if its exercise value is negative.

46
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,580
We now establish pricing bonds for European call options.

47
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,550
First, the payoff of a call can never be negative.

48
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,760
Therefore the price of the option is at least a zero.

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,830
Second, the payoff for the option

50
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,410
is bounded from above by the value

51
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,870
of the stock at expiration.

52
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,050
Therefore, the price of the option cannot be higher than

53
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,580
the current price of the stock.

54
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,660


55
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,400
Next, we establish another lower bound on the option price.

56
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,480
Option price is no less than the price of the stock,

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,190
minus the present value of the strike price, K.

58
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,410
To establish this result, consider two strategies.

59
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,520
First, buy a call.

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,690
Second, buy a share of the stock and borrow the present value

61
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,050
of the strike.

62
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,570
The payoff of the first strategy is at least

63
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,050
as high at maturity of the option as the payoff

64
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,520
of the second strategy.

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,100
We conclude that the price of the call

66
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,550
has to be at least as high as the price of the stock,

67
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,950
minus the present value of the strike,

68
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,940
or K times B. If we combine all of the pricing

69
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,780
bounds we have derived, we establish an upper and a lower

70
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,770
bound on the call price.

71
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:45,130
The call price is bounded above by the stock price.

72
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,940
And it is bounded from below by the maximum of 0

73
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,040
and the stock price minus the present value of the strike.
