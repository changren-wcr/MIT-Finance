1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,320
PROFESSOR: So far, we have been focused on model free results.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,110
These are restrictions on option prices

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,690
that must hold, regardless of the properties

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,120
of the underlying asset.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,460
We now want to refine these results

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,980
to make more precise statements about option prices.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,160
To do that, we need to introduce an explicit model

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,830
of the underlying price process.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,250
The model we introduce is the binomial model.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,090
This is an important model in option pricing.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,400
This model is highly tractable, so it

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,890
helps us understand the logic of option valuation.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,800
It is also very versatile, and is commonly

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,690
used for computing option prices numerically.

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,180
We start with a single period version of the model.

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,980
Current time is zero, and the option matures at time one.

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,360
We can only trade today at time zero.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,220
As we will show, option price depends on the current price

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:10,470
of the underlying stock, the strike price, time to maturity,

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,280
the risk-free interest rate, and return volatility

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,240
of the underlying asset.

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,320
We want to highlight that option prices are highly

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,080
sensitive to stock return volatility, which

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,690
is one of the key inputs into the model.

25
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,180
Consider a specific example--

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,630
a European call option on a stock.

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,030
The current price of the stock is $50.

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,060
There is a single period to maturity.

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,790
Over the next period, the price of the stock

30
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,770
will either go up to $75, or down to $25.

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,870
There are no dividends.

32
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,650
The strike price of the option is $50.

33
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,630
We assume that the one period interest rate is 10%.

34
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,810
One can borrow or lend without constraints

35
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,980
at this risk-free rate.

36
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,230
We represent the stock price process

37
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,700
on the left as a binomial tree.

38
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,030
The initial price here is $50, rising to $75,

39
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,820
or falling to $25 next period.

40
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,140
We express all other prices in relation to this tree.

41
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,620
For the bond price on the right, the value at time one

42
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,340
is the same in the up and down nodes.

43
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,370
Finally, the value of the option at time one

44
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,580
is a function of the stock price at the corresponding nodes

45
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,550
of the tree.

46
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,420
In the up node, the stock price is $75

47
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,030
and the payoff of a call with the $50 strike is $25.

48
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,430
In the down node, the payoff of the co-option is zero.

49
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,070
Our objective is to figure out the price

50
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,950
of the option at time zero.

51
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,060
Our approach is to form a portfolio of stock and bond

52
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,060
that replicates the payoff of the call option at time one.

53
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,680
Then with the low front price, the initial price of the option

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,000
must be equal to the cost of this replicating portfolio.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,560
Suppose our portfolio includes a shares of the stock,

56
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,470
and b units of the riskless bond.

57
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,350
Recall that each unit is $1.

58
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,170
To make sure that the value of the portfolio in the up

59
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,600
and down nodes at time one matches

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,360
the value of the option, we impose two conditions.

61
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,190
First, the value of the portfolio in the up node

62
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,670
is $75 times a, which is the stock

63
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,260
price times the number of shares, plus 1.1 times b,

64
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,020
which is the value of the bond times the number of bond

65
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,560
units in the portfolio.

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,340
This must equal the value of the bond in the node, which is $25.

67
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,090
Second, $25 times a, which is the price

68
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,420
of the stock in the down node, times the number of shares

69
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,430
plus 1.1 times b, must equal the value of the call option

70
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,390
in the down node, which is zero.

71
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,610
We find a unique solution.

72
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,760
Our replicating portfolio must include

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:23,800
half a share of the stock, and minus 11.36 units of the bond.

74
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,030
In other words, to replicate the option, we must borrow $11.36,

75
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,820
and buy half a share of the stock.

76
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,740
The market value of the call must

77
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,220
equal the current cost of this replicating portfolio, which

78
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,620
is $13.64.

79
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,440
The number of shares in the replicating portfolio

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,640
is called the options delta, or the hedge ratio.

81
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,190
In this example, the delta of the option is 0.5.
