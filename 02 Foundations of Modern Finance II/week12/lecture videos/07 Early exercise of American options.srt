00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,270
PROFESSOR: We now turn our attention to American options.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,610
And the American option allows the buyer

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:11,740
to exercise the option at any time prior to maturity.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,220
Here we establish an important model-free relation

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,690
between prices of American and European options.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,660
We know that in general, American options cannot be

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,470
worth less than their European counterparts since the holder

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,860
of the option can always choose not to exercise the option

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,590
until maturity.

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,930
We now show that without dividends

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,180
and with positive interest rates,

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,820
it is never optimal to exercise an American call option early.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,210
Suppose we exercise an American call early.

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,190
In that case, the payoff of the option at the point of exercise

15
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,830
is equal to the difference between the stock

16
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,180
price and the strike.

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,900


18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,270
The payoff from immediate exercise

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,000
is no more than the market price of the option.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,460
In other words, one would be better off

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,340
selling the option than exercising it.

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,980
To see why this is the case, note

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,560
that the market value of the American call

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,720
is at least as high as the market

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,870
value of the European call, with the same strike

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,840
and the same time to maturity.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,560
We also know from our prior analysis of arbitrage pricing

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,950
bonds, that the value of a European call

29
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,030
is no less than the difference between the stock price

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,920
and the present value of the strike.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,310
Under positive interest rates, this is at least as high

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,460
as the difference between the stock price and the strike

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,270
price, which is the payoff from immediate exercise

34
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,190
of the American call.

35
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,900


36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,570
If it is not optimal to exercise an American call

37
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,720
before maturity, then its market value

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,140
must be the same as the value of the corresponding European

39
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,160
call.

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,320
In contrast to the American calls,

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,580
it may be optimal to exercise an American put even if the stock

42
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,060
does not pay dividends.

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,620
Suppose we have a put option with a strike of $10.

44
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,360
Suppose the current stock price is 0.

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,210
If we exercise the option immediately, we collect $10.

46
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,010
If we wait and exercise later, we receive no more than $10,

47
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,190
and at a later date.

48
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,600
We conclude that in this case, under positive interest rates,

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,030
it is optimal to exercise the option immediately.
