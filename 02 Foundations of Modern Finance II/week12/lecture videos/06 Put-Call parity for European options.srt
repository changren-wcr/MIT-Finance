00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600


1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,970
We now establish an important result,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,020
known as the Put-call parity for European options.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,630
This result is based on the straightforward arbitrage

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,740
argument and is a highly robust relation between option prices

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,100
in the data.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,980
We maintain the assumption that the underlying asset,

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,260
the stock, does not pay dividends.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,740
Consider two portfolios.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,840
Portfolio 1 includes a call and the bond with a par value

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,460
equal to the strike.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,460
Portfolio 2 includes a put option

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,810
with the same strike as the call and one share of the stock.

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,940
Compare the payoffs of the two portfolios at maturity.

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,630
These are identical.

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,780
The Law of One Price implies that the initial value

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,270
of the two portfolios must be the same.

17
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,530
This relation is known as the put-call parity.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,870
It connects prices of the European put

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,580
and call options with the same strike price.
