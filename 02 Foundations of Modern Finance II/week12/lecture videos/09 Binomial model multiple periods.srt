1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,200
PROFESSOR: We now extend our binomial model

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,740
to multiple periods.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,730
Suppose that the stock price starts at 50, as before,

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,630
and rises or falls by 50% each period for two periods.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,870
The option is a European call with the strike of $50.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:26,780
At maturity, which is time 2, the option pays 62.5

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,360
in the highest node, where the stock price is $112.50,

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,810
and nothing in other nodes, where the stock price is below

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,830
the strike.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,910
We denote the price of the option in the up node at time 1

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,770
by C sub u.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,600
In the down node, it is C sub d.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,670
We first compute the price of the option

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,740
in each of the time 1 nodes and then proceed back to time 0.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,950
We start in period 1 in the up node.

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,190
The stock price is 75.

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,069
As we did for the one period binomial model,

18
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:08,050
we construct the replicating portfolio.

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,350
In this case, the portfolio includes

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:18,350
0.833 shares of the stock and minus 28.4 units

21
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,240
of the risk-free bond.

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,890
The cost of this replicating portfolio is $34.075.

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,110
This must be the value of the call

24
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,310
option in the up node at time 1 by the law of one price.

25
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,670
In the down node, we are solving the same one-period problem.

26
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,160
The solution in this case is trivial

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,200
because the option pays 0 in both of the nodes next period.

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,280
The value of the option at time 1 in the down node

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,590
is therefore 0.

30
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,990
We move back to time 0.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,440
Again, we are dealing with a single period binomial pricing

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,860
model.

33
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,960
The payoff at the end of the period

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,730
is given by the option values we have computed for time 1.

35
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:16,880
These are $34.075 in the up node and $0 in the down node.

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,390
We construct the replicating portfolio at time 0

37
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,250
and determine the price of the option

38
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,930
as the cost of this replicating portfolio.

39
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,390
The replicating portfolio at time 0

40
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:35,530
includes 0.6815 shares of the stock

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,020
and minus 15.48 units of the bond.

42
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,378
The cost of the replicating portfolio is $18.60.

43
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:51,220
This is the value of the option at time 0.

44
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,060
We now combine our results to show how option replication

45
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,370
works over multiple periods.

46
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,890
We start at time 0 with $18.60, which is the value

47
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,040
of the option at time 0.

48
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,010
We borrow $15.48 at a 10% interest rate

49
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:18,810
to buy 0.6815 shares of the stock.

50
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,540
Note that 0.6815 is the delta of the option at time 0.

51
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,200


52
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,710
At time 1, consider the up node first.

53
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,590
In this node, our replicating portfolio

54
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,110
is worth $34.075, which is equal to the value

55
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,640
of the option at that node.

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,070
We rebalance our portfolio.

57
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,840
In addition to $34.075, we borrow

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:04:00,980
$28.4 at 10% interest rate to buy 0.833 shares of the stock.

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,300
One period later, at time 2, the pay for this portfolio

60
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,790
exactly matches the payoff of the call option.

61
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,750
In the down node at time 1, the option is worth 0,

62
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,180
and we have no stocks or bonds in the replicating portfolio.

63
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,959
The bottom line is that no matter what

64
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,330
happens to the stock price between time 0

65
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,990
and option maturity, our replication strategy

66
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,160
generates the same terminal value as the option.

67
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,070
By the law of one price, the initial cost

68
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,710
of the replicating portfolio must equal

69
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,320
the market price of the option.

70
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,360
To compute the value of the option,

71
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,990
we used the following inputs--

72
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,480
the current price of the stock, the magnitude of stock returns,

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,020
up or down--

74
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,210
this is a measure of stock return volatility--

75
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,430
the risk-free interest rate, the strike price of the option,

76
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,760
and its time to maturity.

77
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,710
It is important that we did not use

78
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,390
the probabilities of the up and down nodes in the stock price.

79
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,010
And we did not use any information about investor's

80
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,550
risk tolerance.

81
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,290
We did not need this information because our pricing argument

82
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,840
relies on option replication.

83
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,030
We replicate the option state by state,

84
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,780
no matter what happens to the stock price.

85
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,060
As a result, we do not need to know

86
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,160
how likely one state is over the other

87
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,895
or how investors feel about gains and losses.

88
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:36,420


89
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,030
The binomial model is clearly restrictive

90
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,770
and raises several questions.

91
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,080
As we apply the model, what should be

92
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,730
the length of each time step?

93
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,120
In the data, prices can clearly take more than two

94
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,220
possible values each period.

95
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,620
How can we reconcile this with the binomial model?

96
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,620
The binomial model has discrete time steps,

97
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,280
while in reality, trading takes place almost continuously.

98
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,230
Is the binomial model a good description of stock returns?

99
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,440
All of these concerns can be addressed by shortening

100
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,030
the time step in the model.

101
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,240
We will explore this in the second part of the lecture.

102
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,450
As we reduce the time step in the binomial model,

103
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,630
we will derive the celebrated Black-Scholes-Merton option

104
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,540
pricing model.
