00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,630
PROFESSOR: In this lecture, we explore relation of options.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,340
Option relation is one of the central topics in this course

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,360
and in the modern theory of finance.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,750
One reason for that is the tremendous economic importance

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,800
of the options market.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,370
Options are highly versatile financial instruments.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,640
Well-developed options markets help market participants

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,000
implement sophisticated trading strategies for both risk

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,790
management and speculation.

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,060
Another important reason for our focus on options

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,100
is that many financial instruments

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,660
and financial decision problems include embedded options.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,690
To handle such problems, we need to develop methods

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,690
for option valuation and risk management.

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,040
Just like futures and forwards, some options trade on exchanges

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,000
and follow common standards and some trade over the counter

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,260
and have more variety.

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,810
We begin our discussion with the most common types

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,350
of options, so-called plain vanilla options,

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,040
which trade both on exchanges and over-the-counter.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,200
Later in the class, we will consider

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,430
more complex types of options.

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,250
The most common and the simplest types of options

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,770
are calls and puts.

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,470
The call option gives its owner the right

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,020
to buy the underlying asset at the given

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,110
price on or before the expiration date.

28
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,790
We call the purchase price the strike price.

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,820
The put option gives its holder the right

30
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,570
to sell the underlying asset at the strike price

31
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,210
on or before the expiration date.

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,070
We distinguish two types of options

33
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,780
based on their exercise rules.

34
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,350
European options allow their owner

35
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,610
to exercise the option only on the expiration date.

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,790
The holder of an American option can

37
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,810
exercise at any time on or prior to the expiration date.

38
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,700


39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,210
To summarize, the key elements in defining an option

40
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,420
are the underlying asset and its price;

41
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,539
the exercise price of the option or what we call the strike

42
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,900
price; the expiration date, also called the maturity date;

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,210
and the option type, European or American.
