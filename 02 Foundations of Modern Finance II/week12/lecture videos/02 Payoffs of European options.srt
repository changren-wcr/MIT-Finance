00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,040
PROFESSOR: In this segment, we consider

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,290
payoffs of the most common types of European options.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,780
Visualizing option payoffs is often

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,230
useful for building intuition about the various properties

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,240
of these securities.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,600
To start, consider a European call option.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,810
As an example, let it be an option on the stock of IBM.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,730
The exercise price at maturity is $100.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,340
We often call the exercise price of the option the strike price.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,030
This option gives the owner of the option, the buyer,

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,160
the right to buy one share of IBM

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,280
at $100 on the expiration date.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,950
Note that this is their right and not their obligation.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,610
The buyer may choose not to exercise the option, if doing

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,840
so would lead to a loss.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,830
As a result, the pay for this option at maturity cannot be

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,430
negative.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,080
In this sense, the call option is

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,520
clearly different from a forward agreement,

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,330
which is a binding obligation to buy the underlying at maturity.

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,500
The payoff of the forward may be positive or negative.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
The payoff of the call option of IBM at maturity

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,890
depends on the price of IBM at that time.

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,530
Let's describe this dependence explicitly.

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,680
If the market price of IBM is below the strike price,

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,780
the buyer is better off letting the option expire unexercised.

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,350
The option to buy IBM at $100 is useless

28
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,050
when the market price of IBM shares is below 100, say $80.

29
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,070
In this situation, the payoff for the option is 0.

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,040
If the market price of IBM is above the strike price,

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,310
then the buyer would exercise the option

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,380
and capture the positive difference

33
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,750
between the market price of IBM and the strike price.

34
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,480
For example, if the price of IBM is $120,

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,960
exercising the option to buy it at $100

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,140
generates a gain of $20.

37
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,020
In summary, the payoff of an option is never negative.

38
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,830
And sometimes that is positive.

39
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,950
The actual payoff depends on the price of the underlying asset,

40
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,710
in this case, the stock of IBM.

41
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,910
The payoff of the call is the maximum of 0

42
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,900
and the difference between the underlying price of maturity

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,340
and the strike price.

44
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,850
We now represent option payoffs graphically.

45
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,280
The top left panel shows the payoff

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,560
of a long position in the call option,

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,860
with a strike price of $100.

48
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,260
This payoff is 0 when the underlying

49
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,600
price is below the strike.

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,420
And it is increasing linearly in the underlying

51
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,640
price for higher values.

52
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,210


53
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,570
For the put option, which is the top right panel,

54
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,460
the payoff is 0 when the underlying

55
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,860
price is above the strike.

56
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,440
Recall that the put option gives the owner the right

57
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,280
to sell the underlying at the strike price.

58
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,700
The payoff of the put is declining in the value

59
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,710
of the underlying asset.

60
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,240
And it is the highest when the underlying price is 0.

61
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,950


62
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,310
The bottom panels show payoffs of the short positions,

63
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,290
in the call on the left and the put on the right.

64
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,990
The payoff of a short position is the negative

65
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,490
of the long position payoff.

66
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,120
The plots are then the mirror images of the long position

67
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,670
payoff plots.

68
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,670
Going forward, we will often combine options

69
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,810
with the underlying asset positions and bonds.

70
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,000
Their payoffs are shown here.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,820
On the left, the plot the payoff of the underlying

72
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,400
asset as a function of itself.

73
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,510
This is, of course, a 45-degree line.

74
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,480
On the right, we show the payoff of the risk-free bond,

75
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,060
which is a constant independent of the underlying price.

76
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,150
It is important to distinguish the payoff of the option, which

77
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,540
is never negative, from its net payoff.

78
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,170
The net payoff of the option includes its cost.

79
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,840
If the option expires unexercised,

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,519
its net payoff is negative.

81
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,930
Consider again our example of a European call option on IBM.

82
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,050
The strike price is $100, and the option

83
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,870
has three months to maturity.

84
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,940
Suppose this call is currently trading at $5.

85
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,940
The three-month interest rate, not annualized, is 1%.

86
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,490
At maturity, the call's net payoff

87
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,300
is equal to its payoff minus the future value of the option

88
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,120
price, which is $5.05.

89
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
As we see on the graph, the net payoff of the option

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,630
is negative for the values of the underlying below the strike

91
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,070
price, and for some values above the strike price.

92
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,640
The break-even point is that value

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,450
of the underlying that exceeds the strike by the future value

94
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,160
of the option price.

95
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,100
In this case, the break even is $105.05.

96
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,200
The price of IBM must be above this threshold,

97
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,820
above $105.05, in order for the holder of the option

98
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,790
to make a profit.
