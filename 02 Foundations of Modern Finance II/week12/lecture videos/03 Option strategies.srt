00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,400
PROFESSOR: We now use payoff diagrams

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,460
to visualize properties of the several common options

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,380
strategies.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,540
Keep in mind that what we are looking at

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,780
are the payoffs, not the net payoffs.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,360
In other words, we are not taking into account

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,590
the initial cost of setting up these positions.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,570
The first strategy we consider is the protective put.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,320
This trade consists of two positions, a long position

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,130
in the underlying stock, and a long position in the put

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,040
option.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,150
The combined payoff is shown in the bottom panel.

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,030
The strategy offers the buyer participation in the upside.

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,680
This position appreciates in value as the stock price rises.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,460
At the same time, the put option limits potential losses,

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,150
creating a floor in the payoff.

17
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,940
The second strategy we consider is the bull spread.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,260
This trade involves two call options of the same maturity.

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,770
In this example, the two options have strikes of $40 and $55.

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,910
We buy the call with the lowest strike, $40,

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,570
and sell the call with the highest strike, $55.

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,140
The resulting position, shown in the lower panel,

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:25,880
offers some upside exposure, which is kept above $55.

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,940
Compare this to the straight call with the $40 strike.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,780
This position sacrifices participation in further upside

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,760
above $55 in exchange for the lower initial cost.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,050
The next rate we consider is the straddle.

28
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,700
The straddle involves buying two options, a call and the put,

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,920
with the same strike price and the same maturity date.

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,710
The payoff for this position is relatively high

31
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,920
when the stock price is far away from the strike price,

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,250
on either side.

33
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,210
We can see this from the payoff diagram in the bottom panel.

34
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,050
Straddles can be used to bet on large moves in the stock price,

35
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,699
regardless of their direction.

36
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,130
In other words, these are bets on higher future volatility

37
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,290
of the underlying price.

38
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,500
Note that buying a straddle is not a free lunch.

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,410
It is not right to say that the holder of the straddle

40
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,220
makes money no matter which way the underlying price moves.

41
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,160
Our plots shows strategy payoffs.

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,140
They ignore the initial cost.

43
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,270
The buyer of the straddle loses money at maturity

44
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,230
if the underlying price fails to move far enough

45
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,740
away from the strike price.
