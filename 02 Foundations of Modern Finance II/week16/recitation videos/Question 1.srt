1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,500
INSTRUCTOR: There is a private firm called XYZ.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,860
This firm manufactures shoes.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,340
This company wants to go public, or do an IPO,

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,910
and it's hired an investment bank as its advisor.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,400
The bank will assess the fair market value of this firm.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,460
And one of the key ingredients that

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,920
is needed to assess the fair market value

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,250
is the assessment of the business risk of this firm.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,980
One way of doing this for an investment bank

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,560
is to look at the current public firms

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,640
and to see whether there are any shoe manufacturers which

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,880
we can use to assess the business risk of shoe

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,040
manufacturing business.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,560
After further investigation, investment bank

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,190
could not find any "pure plays," or the companies

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,340
that just manufacture shoes.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,630
However, they were able to find two companies that manufacture

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,450
both shoes and apparel.

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,180
These are the two firms, A and B.

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,180
And based on the assessment of the investment bank,

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,030
these are the percentages of the market

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,670
value of the current firm A and B

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,260
that comes from shoe and apparel business correspondingly.

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,500
For example, for firm A, the current market value

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,920
of this firm is derived 40% from the shoe manufacturing

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,790
business and 60% from the apparel business.

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,650
For firm B, this percentage is 70% and 30%.

28
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,640
The investment bank assessed the business

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,530
risk of these two firms.

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,370
And for firm A, firm beta is 0.9.

31
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,340
And for firm B, the firm beta is 0.7.

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,200
We will assume that both of these firms

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,510
are full equity financed.

34
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,600
So both of them don't have debt, so only

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,790
equity in their capital structure.

36
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,760
Now, based on this information, we

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,880
would like to assess the business risk of shoe

38
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,960
manufacturing so that we can assess the business

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,890
risk of our private firm XYZ.

40
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,800
Let's solve this question.

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,480
I will start by denoting by beta s, the beta of pure shoe

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,460
manufacturing business.

43
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,170
Similarly, by beta a, I will denote the beta of pure apparel

44
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,040
business.

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,560
Now let's go back to firm A and think

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,990
of this firm as a portfolio of these two pure shoe

47
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,990
manufacturing and pure apparel business.

48
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,150
Since we know the market weights of both

49
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,380
of these businesses in the business of firm A,

50
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,820
we can write down the following equation.

51
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,570
So 40% of beta s plus 60% of beta a

52
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,880
would be equal to the current observed beta of this firm A.

53
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,800
So again, we can write down this equation.

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,130
Because the portfolio beta, or the portfolio

55
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,520
of the firm that consists of these two businesses,

56
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,290
would equal to the weighted average

57
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,520
of betas of these individual lines of businesses.

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,870
Similarly, we can write down the same equation for firm B.

59
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:18,160
70% times beta s, because this firm consists 70% of shoe

60
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,310
manufacturing business and 30% of apparel business-- so 70%,

61
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,290
times beta s--

62
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:29,050
plus 30% times beta a would equal to 0.7.

63
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,340
Now, the goal is to find beta s and beta a.

64
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,990
These are two unknowns.

65
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,070
Now we have two equations and two unknowns.

66
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,645
And we can solve the system of equations for beta s and beta

67
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:41,590
a.

68
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,640
The solution is this.

69
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,290
So beta s equals to 0.5 and beta a equals to 1.17.

70
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,500
This means that a pure shoe manufacturing business will

71
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,060
have a beta of 0.5 and a purely apparel business

72
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,880
will have a beta of 1.17.

73
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,980
In our case, since we're trying to assess

74
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,340
the risk of purely shoe manufacturing

75
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,600
business for our private firm XYZ, the beta of this firm

76
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,080
should be 0.5.

77
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,035
