00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510


1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,850
In this video, we will consider an example

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,010
that demonstrates how discount rates may

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,380
differ over different horizons.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,380
We will consider an asset, whose payoff is linked

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,330
to the price of crude oil.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,410
Suppose the current price of crude oil is $55 per barrel.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,910
Consider an asset that in year 5 pays the realized

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,220
price of oil in year 1.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,980
What is the current value of this asset?

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,770
Let's start by thinking, what should be the value

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,810
of this asset in year 1?

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,560
Between now and the end of year 1, the price of oil

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,210
is uncertain.

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,360
But starting in year 2 and until the end of year 5,

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,220
the price of oil at the end of year 1 is known.

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,850
Therefore, between year 1 and year 5,

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,680
this asset is risk free.

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,340
And hence, its value in year 1 is

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,360
p_1 divided by 1 plus r_f raised to the power 4.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,990
Here by p_1, we're denoting the price of oil in year 1,

21
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,480
and by r_f, we're denoting the risk-free rate.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,780
Now between year 0 and year 1, we

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,010
don't know what the price of oil will be.

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,450
Let's assume that the expected return on oil is r_o.

25
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,910
For both the risk-free rate and the expected return on oil,

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,910
we will assume that these returns

27
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,220
are the same at all horizons.

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,020
In other words, the term structure

29
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,450
of these rates of return is flat.

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,520
The value of this asset in year 0

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,250
equals its expected value in year 1, discounted

32
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,950
to present at rates r_o to reflect

33
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,790
the riskiness of disaster between year 0 and year 1.

34
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,010
Plugging in the value of this asset in year 1

35
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,560
into this equation, we get expected value

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,340
of p_1 divided by 1 plus r_f raised to the power of 4,

37
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,160
divided by 1 plus r_o.

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,790
Since there is no uncertainty in the risk-free rate r_f,

39
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,820
we get the expected value of p_1 divided

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,910
by 1 plus r_o multiplied by 1 plus r_f

41
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,590
raised to the power of 4.

42
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,210
You can see that we're discounting

43
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,660
the cash flows that we get from this asset at different rates

44
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,250
during this five-year time period.

45
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,200
This is simply due to the fact that its riskiness changes

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,240
during this time period.

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,970
The final step is to figure out what is the expected

48
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,400
price of oil in year 1.

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,490
It simply is the current price multiplied by the expected rate

50
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,630
of return on oil.

51
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,790
We see that 1 plus r_o in the numerator and denominator

52
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,920
of this equation cancels out.

53
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,290
And we are simply left with the current price

54
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,580
of oil divided by 1 plus r_f raised to the power of 4.

55
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,010
If we assume that the risk-free rate is 2%,

56
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,950
then the current value of this asset is $50.81.

57
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,760
Next, let's find the value of an asset that, in year 5,

58
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,510
pays the realized price of oil in year 2.

59
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,160
We can repeat the steps that we did

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,530
to find the value of the previous asset.

61
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,530
First, notice that there is no uncertainty

62
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,750
in what the payoff of this asset will

63
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,420
be between the year 2 and the year 5.

64
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,200
Therefore, we can find the value of this asset in year 2,

65
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,910
by discounting the cash flow that we

66
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,900
get from this asset in year 5 at the risk-free rate.

67
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,150
We see that the value of this asset in year

68
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,100
equals p_2 divided by 1 plus r_f raised to the power of 3.

69
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,620
Between year 0 and year 2, we don't know

70
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,990
what the price of oil will be.

71
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,030
The value of this asset in year 0

72
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,870
equals its expected value in year 2, discounted to present,

73
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,810
at the rate r_o, to reflect the riskiness of this asset

74
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,800
between year 0 and year 2.

75
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,990
Plugging in the value of this asset in year 2

76
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,540
into this equation, we get expected value

77
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,700
of p_2 divided by 1 plus r_f raised

78
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,000
to the power of 3, divided by 1 plus r_o raised

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,510
to the power of 2, which gives us expected value of p_2

80
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,080
divided by 1 plus r_o squared multiplied by 1

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,840
plus r_f raised to the power of 3.

82
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,000
Similar to the first asset, notice

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,920
that we are discounting the cash flows

84
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,950
that we get from this asset at different rates

85
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,690
during this five-year time period.

86
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,630
This is because the riskiness of this asset

87
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,690
changes as we go from year 2 to year 3

88
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,010
because we no longer bear uncertainty in oil prices.

89
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,079
The expected price of oil in year 2

90
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,620
is the current price multiplied by the expected rate of return

91
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,570
over the next two years.

92
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,050
We see that 1 plus r_o squared in the numerator

93
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,020
and denominator cancels out, and we

94
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,890
are left with p_0, which is the current price of oil,

95
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,800
divided by 1 plus the risk-free rate raised to the power of 3.

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,230
Recall that the risk-free rate is 2%.

97
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:50,430
Hence the current value of this asset is $51.83.

98
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,860
Notice that the value of this asset, which in year 5

99
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,320
pays the price of oil in year 2, is

100
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,040
higher than the value of the previous asset, which in year 5

101
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,610
paid the price of oil in year 1.

102
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,980
This is because this asset is riskier

103
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,980
as we're exposed to the oil price risk for one

104
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,680
additional year.

105
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,650
Let's consider one more asset, that in year 5

106
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,780
pays p_1 plus p_2 plus p_5 divided by 3,

107
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,580
where p_1, p_2 and p_5 are the realized prices of oil in years

108
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,130
1, 2, and 5 respectively.

109
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,650
What is the current value of this asset?

110
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,810
The current value of this asset is simply

111
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,950
1/3 of the value of the asset that pays p_1 in the year 5

112
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,640
plus 1/3 of the value of the asset that pays p_2 in year 5,

113
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,800
plus 1/3 of the value of the asset that pays p_5 in year 5.

114
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,350
We have already found the values of assets

115
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,470
that pay p_1 and p_2 in year 5.

116
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,650
So what's left is to find the value of the asset that

117
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,840
pays p_5 in year 5.

118
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,290
In this case, we varied the oil price risk all the way

119
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,150
to the end of year 5.

120
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,850
Therefore, the current value of the asset

121
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,140
is the expected price of oil in year 5 divided by 1 plus

122
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,260
r_o raised to the power of 5.

123
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,810
Since the expected oil price in year 5

124
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,380
is the current oil price multiplied by 1 plus r_o raised

125
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,320
to the power of 5, the current value of this asset

126
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,560
is simply the current oil price.

127
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,150
It's quite simple to understand why.

128
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,810
The market currently values oil at $55 a barrel.

129
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,220
The asset that in year 5 pays the price of oil in year 5

130
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,210
has to have the same value as the oil itself,

131
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,510
as it has identical risk.

132
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,880
Now we can combine all the results

133
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,580
to find the current value of the asset that in year five

134
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,620
pays p_1 plus p_2 plus p_5 divided by 3.

135
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,850
It's value equals 1/3 of the current oil price divided

136
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,540
by a 1 plus the risk-free rate raised to the power of 4,

137
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,390
plus 1/3 of the current oil price divided by 1

138
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,240
plus risk-free rate raised to the power of 3,

139
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,270
plus 1/3 of the current oil price.

140
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,980
Recall that the risk-free rate is 2%,

141
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,530
and the current oil price is $55.

142
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,030
This gives us the current value of this asset of $52.55.

143
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,178
