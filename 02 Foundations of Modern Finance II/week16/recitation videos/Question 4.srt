00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,850
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,460
learn how to value a growth option, which

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,070
is an important class of real options.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,680
Consider a firm, which operates a restaurant.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,170
The restaurant is expected to generate after-tax cash

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,260
flow of $1 million next year.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,470
This cash flow is expected to grow at a 2% annual rate

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,790
in perpetuity.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,010
Next year, the firm will have an opportunity

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,840
to open a new restaurant.

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,800
If this new restaurant is opened,

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,010
it will start generating exactly the same cash

13
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,070
flow as the first restaurant in year two.

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,260
To be precise, the first restaurant

15
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,140
will generate $1.02 million in year two.

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,630
And the second restaurant, if built,

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,290
will generate $1.02 million as well.

18
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,970
These cash flows will continue to grow

19
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,610
at 2% rate in perpetuity.

20
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,410
There is an uncertainty with respect

21
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,110
to the investment costs needed to open

22
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,790
the new restaurant next year.

23
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,580
Depending on the state of the economy and availability

24
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,840
of retail space, these costs can be either $5 million

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,190
with 20% probability, or $15 million with 80% probability.

26
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,940
Let's assume that the appropriate discount

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,580
rate for the restaurant business is 12%.

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,920
What is the present value of this growth opportunity?

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,900
Let's start by determining the optimal decision in year one.

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,570
Should we open the second restaurant or not?

31
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,340
What would be the value of the firm

32
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,910
if opening costs are $5 million and we decide

33
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,100
to open the new restaurant?

34
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,080
The value of the firm in the year one

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,020
will be determined by the costs that we need to incur in order

36
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,410
to open the second restaurant, and the value of the cash flow

37
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,860
stream from year two onwards.

38
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,260
The cash flows will be $1.02 million

39
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,690
from each of the two restaurants.

40
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,070
Given the discount rate of 4% and the perpetual growth of 2%,

41
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,800
we find that the firm value in year one will be $15.4 million.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,740
Now, what will be the value of the firm

43
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,100
if opening costs are $5 million, and we decide

44
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,050
not to open the new restaurant?

45
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,710
In this case, we will have only one restaurant that in year two

46
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,680
will bring in the cash flow of $1.02 million.

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,820
The value of the firm in this case will be $10.2 million.

48
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's summarize these findings.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,550
If the opening costs are $5 million,

50
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,560
and if we open the new restaurant,

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,130
the firm value will be $15.4 million.

52
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,500
If we decide not to open the new restaurant,

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,620
the firm value will be $10.2 million.

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,360
It is clear that the optimal decision

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,120
is to open the new restaurant.

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,370
Let's repeat these steps and determine

57
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,200
what is the optimal decision if the opening

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,880
costs are $15 million.

59
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,660
If we open the new restaurant we're spending $15 million

60
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,260
in the year one, and generating $1.02 million times

61
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,260
2 from year two onwards.

62
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,470
The firm value in this case is $5.4 million.

63
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,800
If we don't open the new restaurant,

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,130
we generate cash flows from only one restaurant and the firm

65
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,950
value in this case remains $10.2 million.

66
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,860
Let's summarize.

67
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,680
If the opening costs are $15 million

68
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,450
and if we open the new restaurant,

69
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,350
the firm value will be $5.4 million.

70
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,240
If we decide not to open the new restaurant,

71
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,180
the firm value will be $10.2 million.

72
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,730
It is clear that the optimal decision in this case

73
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,350
is not to open the new restaurant.

74
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,260
Knowing the optimal business decision in year one,

75
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,650
we can compute the current value of the firm.

76
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,390
The current firm value is the sum

77
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,480
of the cash flow in year one, discounted to present,

78
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,870
plus the continuation of value of the firm in the year one

79
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,930
discounted to present as well.

80
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,300
Recall that the cash flow in year one is $1 million.

81
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,020
Also recall that with probability of 20%,

82
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,060
the opening costs will be $5 million.

83
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,120
In which case, we open the new restaurant

84
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,750
and realize the firm value of $15.4 million.

85
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,340
And with the remaining probability of 80%,

86
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,400
the opening costs will be $50 million.

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,460
In which case, we don't open the new restaurant.

88
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,750
The firm value in this case will be only 10.2 million.

89
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,440
This gives us the current firm value of $10.93 million.

90
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,190
Finally, let's determine the value of the growth

91
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,140
option for this firm.

92
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,380
We can compute the value of the growth option as the difference

93
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,710
between the firm value with the growth option,

94
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,290
minus the firm value without the growth option.

95
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,270
We have just computed the value of the firm

96
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,400
with the growth option.

97
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,040
So what remains to be done is to compute the current firm value

98
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,050
without the growth option.

99
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,180
The value of the firm without the growth option

100
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,460
is simply the value of growing perpetuity

101
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,500
that pays $1 million, starting next year, and grows at 2%.

102
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,390
The firm value in this case is $10 million.

103
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,140
Combining the results, we find that the value

104
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,100
of the growth opportunity for this firm is $930,000.

105
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,190
We can see that this value is fairly low compared

106
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,760
to the value of the firm without the growth opportunity.

107
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,980
The reason for this is that the likelihood

108
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,470
of being able to develop the new restaurant next year

109
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,826
at a low cost of $5 million is only 20%.

110
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:15,326
