1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,310
PROFESSOR: Kinross Gold is considering

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,890
to acquire a gold mine in Russia.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,330
Estimated reserves of this mine are 1 million ounces.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,340
It takes one year to extract gold,

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,790
and estimated extraction costs are $1,000 per ounce.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,690
The current price of gold is $1,200 per ounce.

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,510
It will either increase to $1,600 per ounce

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,890
or decrease to $900 per ounce next year,

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,270
and after that it will stay at that level forever.

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,260
The risk free rate is 2%, and the gold price risk

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,890
is not diversifiable.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,880
We will answer two questions.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,060
First, what is the value of this mine

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,910
if extraction starts today?

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,360
And second, if Kinross Gold can wait for a year

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,600
to start the extraction process, and they can also

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,230
abandon this mine, what is its current value?

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,042
Let's start this question by discussing

19
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:00,000
what does the statement of "the gold price risk

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,670
is not diversifiable" actually I mean?

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,470
If it was fully diversifiable, or as we say,

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,270
idiosyncratic, then we could have discounted cash flows

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,560
at the risk-free rate.

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,990
Since it is not diversifiable, we cannot discount them

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,530
at the risk-free rate.

26
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,780
But we are not given a discount rate in this question.

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,810
So what should we do?

28
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,830
We will use prices of traded assets to find state prices,

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,610
and we will use the state prices to value the mine.

30
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,790
This is analogous to how we valued options, where

31
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,510
we used prices of the risk-free bond and the stock

32
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,060
to obtain state prices and used the state

33
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,390
prices to price the option.

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,370
Let's start by drawing a tree that

35
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,610
captures the evolution of future gold prices.

36
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,470
The current price is $1,200, and it will either go up to $1,600

37
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,170
or go down to $900.

38
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,390
We will use the same notation we adopted

39
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,370
when we studied options.

40
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,830
How will they know the current price by s,

41
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,780
and we'll use multipliers u and d for the up and down moves

42
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,570
respectively.

43
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,430
Based on given prices of gold, we can compute u and d.

44
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,170
U equals to 1,600 divided by 1,200, which is 1.33,

45
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:23,070
and d equals to 900 divided by 1,200, which is 0.75.

46
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,230
Let's compute the risk neutral probabilities

47
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,600
of the up and down moves.

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,810
qu, which is the risk neutral probability of the up move,

49
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,240
equals 1 plus the risk free rate minus d divided by u minus d.

50
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,770
Recall that the risk free rate is

51
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:43,230
2%, which gives us qu of 0.463.

52
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,910
qd equals to u minus 1 plus rf, divided by u minus d,

53
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,360
and this gives us 0.537.

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,248
qd can also be simply computed as 1 minus qu,

55
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:56,040
because the risk neutral probabilities have

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,570
to add up to 1.

57
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,700
Now we can compute state prices.

58
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,210
Phi u, which is the price of the up state,

59
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:10,500
is qu divided by 1 plus rf, which equals 0.454.

60
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,400
Similarly, phi d, which is the price of the down state,

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,420
is qd divided by 1 plus rf, which equals to 0.527.

62
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,640
Equipped with state prices, we can

63
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,020
find the present value of revenue

64
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,300
if we start extraction today.

65
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,540
Recall that it takes us one year to finish the extraction

66
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,680
and sell the gold.

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,110
The present value of next year's revenue is 1,600 times

68
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,070
phi u plus 900 times phi d.

69
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,140
This equals 1,200.

70
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,560
Therefore, the current expected revenue per ounce of gold

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,750
is $1,200.

72
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,690
This, of course, should not surprise us.

73
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,550
The expected revenue per ounce of gold

74
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,620
should, of course, equal the current market

75
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,130
price of gold, which we were given in the beginning.

76
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,470
In fact, our state prices were computed based

77
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,000
on the current price of gold.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,670
We could have in principle answered this question

79
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,090
without computing the state prices.

80
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,850
We have done this here for illustrative purposes.

81
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,800
Plus we will utilize state process

82
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,740
in the second part of this question.

83
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,490
Given that extraction costs are $1,000 per ounce,

84
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,930
our cash flow is $200 per ounce of gold.

85
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,870
Since the mine contains one million ounces of gold,

86
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,140
the value of this mine if we start extraction now

87
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,260
is $200 million.

88
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,530
Now let's figure out what will be the value of this mine

89
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,020
if we could delay gold extraction for a year

90
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,710
and abandon this mine if it is profitable to do so.

91
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,110
Note that we will do the extraction only

92
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,530
in the up state, where gold prices exceed the extraction

93
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,760
costs.

94
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,320
In the down state, we will simply abandon the mine.

95
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,020
This means that in year one, in the down state,

96
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,820
the value of this mine is 0.

97
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,810
In the up state, its value can be computed as follows.

98
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,500
We pay $1,000 per ounce in year one to receive $1,600 per ounce

99
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,290
with certainty in year 2.

100
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,430
Therefore, the value per ounce in year one in the up state

101
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,050
is negative $1,000 plus $1,600 divided by 1

102
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,510
plus the risk free rate, which is 2%,

103
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,400
and this equals to $568.63.

104
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,380
Given the above, the current value

105
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:38,620
of this mine per ounce of gold is 568.63 times phi u plus 0

106
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,030
times phi d.

107
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,430
This gives us $258.03.

108
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,100
Given that we can extract one million ounces,

109
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,150
the total value of the mine is $258.03 million.

110
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,330
The flexibility to wait and abandon

111
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,050
is clearly very valuable and increases the value

112
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,060
of this mine by $58.03 million.
