00:00:00,143 --> 00:00:01,560
INSTRUCTOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,970
find the value of the abandonment

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,280
option of the gold mine that Kinross Gold is

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,050
considering to acquire.

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,920
The value of the first abandonment option,

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,720
which abbreviate as AO, can be found as the value of the mine

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,360
with the option minus the value of the mine without the option.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,710
Note that in the previous video, we only

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,470
found the value of the mine if we start production now

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,510
and the value of the mine if we delay production for one year

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,550
and can abandon it.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,320
The difference in the value of the two

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,565
is not necessarily the value of the abandonment option.

14
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:35,940
The reason for this is that we're

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,210
conflating two options, the option to delay

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,220
and the option to abandon.

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,350
To separate the two, we need to compute

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,300
the value of the mine with the option to delay

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,870
but not the option to abandon.

20
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,260
To do this, let's compute the value of the mine if we delay

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,983
production by one year but cannot abandon the mine.

22
00:00:57,983 --> 00:00:59,400
We have already computed the value

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,690
of the mine in the up state.

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,910
It was $258.03 per ounce of gold.

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,860
Similarly, we can compute the value

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,020
of the mine in the down state.

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,460
It is negative $1,000 plus $900 divided by 1

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,460
plus the risk-free rate, which equals to negative $117.65

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,500
per ounce of gold.

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,380
To compute the current value of the mine per ounce of gold,

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,660
we multiply its value in the up state

32
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,000
by the price of the up state and add its value

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,500
in the down state multiplied by the price of the down state.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,180
This gives us the current value of mine

35
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,510
per ounce of gold of $196.08.

36
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,520
This result implies that the value

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,190
of the mine if we start production today

38
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,410
is greater than the value of the mine

39
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,340
if we delay production for one year.

40
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,490
This means that the option to delay in this case

41
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,900
is worthless.

42
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,940
Overall, this implies that the current value

43
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,605
of the mine without the option to abandon is $200 million.

44
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:05,890
Putting this all together, we have the following.

45
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,710
The value of the mine with the option to abandon

46
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,810
is $258.03 million.

47
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,190
And the value of the mine without the option to abandon

48
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,680
is $200 million.

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,160
This means that the value of the abandonment option

50
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,500
is $58.03 million.

51
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,000
