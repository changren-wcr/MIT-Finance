00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,340
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,200
learn how to determine the cost of capital

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,050
for a firm or a project in situations

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,220
when asset returns are characterized by factor models.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,900
A private equity fund is considering

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,170
to buy a gold mining company, Kinross Gold.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,570
The firm is expected to generate after-tax cash

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,820
flow of $540 million next year.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,390
This cash flow is expected to grow at 2.5% in perpetuity.

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,780
The private equity fund needs to determine the cost of capital

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,630
for Kinross Gold in order to estimate its value.

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,790
Suppose that asset returns are characterized

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,990
by a two-factor model where the first risk factor is the market

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,390
risk and the second risk factor is the price of gold.

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,180
You have estimated factor loadings for Kinross Gold

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,260
and found that its loading on the market risk is 0.3

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,350
and its loading on the gold price risk is 1.92.

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,360
In order to estimate Kinross Gold's cost of capital,

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,910
you have obtained the following information on three

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,290
well diversified portfolios, A, B, and C. This table

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,920
gives you expected returns and factor loadings on the market

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,300
risk and the gold price risk for each of the three portfolios.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,100
What price the private equity fund

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,940
should be willing to pay in order to buy Kinross Gold?

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,680
We will assume that Kinross Gold does not

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,820
have debt on its balance sheet.

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,830
In other words, it is an all-equity financed firm.

28
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,040
We can find the value of Kinross Gold using the Gordon growth

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,400
model.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,840
Recall that the question gives us the after-tax cash flow

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,170
that Kinross Gold is expected to generate in year one.

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,570
After that, this cash flow will grow in perpetuity

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,660
at a constant rate.

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,510
Therefore, the value of the firm is the cash flow

35
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,240
in year one divided by r minus g, where

36
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,420
r is the cost of capital and g is

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,430
the perpetual constant growth rate.

38
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,400
We know that the cash flow in year one

39
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,110
is expected to be $540 million and the perpetual growth

40
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,840
rate is 2.5%.

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,180
Therefore, the only unknown in this equation

42
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,620
is the cost of capital.

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,810
And therefore, to find the value of this firm,

44
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,800
we need to find its cost of capital.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,890
To find the cost of capital, we will utilize the arbitrage

46
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,480
pricing theory.

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,300
Recall the APT pricing equation from the first part

48
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,090
of this course.

49
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,010
This equation tells us that the expected return on portfolio P

50
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,450
equals to the risk-free rate plus the factor risk

51
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,690
premium multiplied by the factor loadings.

52
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,030
In our case of the two-factor model,

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,410
the expected return in the portfolio P

54
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,820
equals the risk-free rate plus the price of the first factor,

55
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,180
lambda 1, multiplied by the loading of portfolio P

56
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,330
on this first factor, beta P1.

57
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,750
Plus the price of the second risk factor, lambda 2,

58
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,270
multiplied by the loading of this portfolio P

59
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,200
on the second risk factor, beta P2.

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
Let's write this equation specifically

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,270
for our portfolios starting with portfolio

62
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,340
A. The expected return on portfolio A

63
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,250
equals to the risk-free rate plus lambda 1 multiplied

64
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,160
by the loading of portfolio A on the first factor,

65
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,580
plus lambda 2 multiplied by the loading of portfolio A

66
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,020
on the second factor.

67
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,920
We are given the expected return on portfolio A, which is 4%,

68
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,370
and the factor loadings on factors one and two, which

69
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,810
are 0 and 1, respectively.

70
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,990
Therefore, we have the following equation.

71
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,460
4% equals RF, plus lambda 1 multiplied by 0,

72
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,250
plus lambda 2 multiplied by 1.

73
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,100
Given the expected returns and factor loadings of portfolios B

74
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,760
and C, we can now write the second and third equations

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,640
that correspond to portfolios B and C, respectively.

76
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,770
This gives us a system of three equations with three unknowns.

77
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,680
The unknowns are the risk-free rate and the factor risk

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,060
premium.

79
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,790
Solving this system would get the following.

80
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,520
The risk-free rate is 2%, the risk premium

81
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,250
on the market factor is 6%, and the risk premium on gold is 2%.

82
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,250
Knowing the risk-free rate and factor risk premia,

83
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,130
we can find the expected return on Kinross Gold,

84
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,300
which is the estimate of its cost of capital.

85
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,820
Recall that Kinross Gold's loading on the market is 0.3

86
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,360
and its loading on gold is 1.92.

87
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,820
These loadings, by the way, come from my video

88
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,220
in the first part of the course where

89
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,900
I explain how to estimate factor models empirically.

90
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,980
I recommend you to re-watch that video.

91
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,566
We find that the cost of capital for Kinross Gold is 7.64%.

92
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:51,750
Putting everything together we can find the current value

93
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,310
of Kinross Gold.

94
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,730
It is $10.51 billion.

95
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,600
This is what the private equity fund

96
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,500
should be willing to pay in order to acquire this firm.

97
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,000
