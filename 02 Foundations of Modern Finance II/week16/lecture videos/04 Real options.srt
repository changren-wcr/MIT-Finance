00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,430
PROFESSOR: When evaluating a project,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,450
we rely on two inputs, the project's expected cash

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,160
flow, and its discount rate.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,430
The expected cash flow is based on information

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,330
we have today about the project's future prospects.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,690
And the discount rate is based on the risk characteristics

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,120
of the cash flow.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,360
What may be sometimes underestimated

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,650
is the fact that future cash flow forecasts should also

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,790
take into account possible actions the firm's managers may

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,900
take when they receive new information on the project's

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,340
prospects.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,130
In real investments, managers often

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,620
have options to revise decisions or to take on new decisions

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,010
in response to new information.

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,420
Such a flexibility is also called "real options"

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,350
as they associate with real investment decisions.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,269
This is to distinguish them from financial options, which

19
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,540
are associated with financial contracts.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,810
Real options can be very valuable

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,200
and should be included in the valuation of a project.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,470
For example, after launching a product,

23
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,440
the manager may be able to shut it down

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,490
if things turn out to be a lot worse than expected,

25
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,540
to avoid severe losses, or to expand production

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,120
if there is an unexpected increase

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,950
in the demand for the product.

28
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,510


29
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,800
The possibility to take on new decisions or initiatives

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,080
is sometimes also referred to as "strategic considerations,"

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,190
which should be included in the NPV analysis.

32
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,570
In considering real options associated with a project,

33
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,700
we deal with them in two steps.

34
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,570
First is identification.

35
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,870
Are there real options embedded in the project,

36
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,270
and what types of options are they?

37
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,260
And the second step is about valuation,

38
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,450
how to value these real options.

39
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,560
We will start with the identification of real options.

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,630
First, we know that real options are embedded

41
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,070
in almost all the projects we deal with except the most

42
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,220
trivial ones.

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,320
They are not hard to find.

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,160
For any business, you have almost infinite amount

45
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,220
of flexibility to modify different parts

46
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,050
of your operations.

47
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,390
But most of them are probably not

48
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,670
of the first order importance.

49
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,760
The key in considering real options

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,250
is to find the important ones.

51
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,990
It takes finance knowledge, practice, and sometimes vision

52
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,230
to do it well.

53
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,410
Two considerations are essential for real or strategic options.

54
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:15,820
The first is, new information possibly arrives in the future.

55
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,030
Second, the new information, when arrives,

56
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,810
may affect decisions.

57
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,050
The reason behind these two conditions are straightforward.

58
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,010
First, if there's no new information in the future,

59
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,660
we would have perfect foresight and need no flexibility.

60
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,540
Second, when we have new information,

61
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,810
it is of no value if we cannot act on it.

62
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,290
Therefore, identifying real options first

63
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,770
boils down to what kind of relevant information

64
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,910
may arrive in the future and how, if at all,

65
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,830
it may substantially change our decisions.
