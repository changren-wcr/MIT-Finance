00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,140
PROFESSOR: From our previous discussions in part one

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,120
and earlier in part two of this course,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,230
we have established the following results

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,070
about the appropriate discount rates for a project.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,060
A project's discount rate or the required rate of return or cost

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,750
of capital is the expected rate of return

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,930
demanded by the financial market or investors

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,510
in the financial market for the project

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,100
or traded assets in the market with a similar timing and risk

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,220
characteristics.

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,090
Therefore, a project's discount rate

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,280
is tied to the timing and risk of its cash flow.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,340
Consequently, the discount rate is usually

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,740
different for different projects.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,760
Simply because the timing and the risk of their cash flows

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,080
can be quite different.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,560
An important implication of these results

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,160
is that, in general, it's incorrect to use

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,800
a firm wide cost of capital to discount

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,910
cash flows from different projects the firm faces.

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,836
What is the discount rate of a project, then?

22
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:15,360
In the simplest case, a single discount rate

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,920
can be used for all pieces of the cash flow from the project.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,410
This case corresponds to the situation

25
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,340
where the term structure of discount rates is flat.

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,610
Although we often use this case in our examples

27
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,590
and computations, this is true only under very restrictive

28
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,130
conditions.

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,130
In the general case, different discount rates

30
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,900
are needed for different pieces of the project's cash flow.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,840
This arises for two reasons.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,890
First, the term structure of interest rates

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,710
is in general not flat.

34
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,040
That is, the time value of money for the market

35
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,230
is not constant for different time horizons.

36
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,250
This implies that even for risk free cash flows,

37
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,919
the discount rate is in general different

38
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,480
depending on the timing.

39
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,620
Second, different pieces of a cash flow in general

40
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,690
have different risks.

41
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,310
Consequently, their risk premiums will be different.

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,260
We now consider the discount rate of a project.

43
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,230
For simplicity, let's assume a single discount

44
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,330
rate is sufficient.

45
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,720
A projects' required rate of return, or discount rate,

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,350
is determined by systematic risk.

47
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,590
For concreteness, let's assume that the CAPM

48
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,310
holds in determining an asset's systematic risk

49
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,800
and the corresponding risk premium.

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,980
Then, the project's required rate of return

51
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,220
is given by its beta.

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,780
That is, R bar the expected rate of return on the project,

53
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,180
it should equal to rf, which is risk free rate, plus the beta

54
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,500
of the project times the risk premium on the market

55
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,780
portfolio, that is R bar m minus rf.

56
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,800
Therefore, if we know the project's beta, not the firm's

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,330
beta, its discount rate can be easily determined by the CAPM.

58
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,990


59
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,010
How do we determine the project's beta?

60
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,710
Well, we consider three scenarios or approaches.

61
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,420
The first is to find comparable pure play

62
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,790
companies traded in a market and use their betas.

63
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,960
That is, to use the market information.

64
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,020
The second scenario approach is to find comparable projects

65
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,010
and use their cash flows to estimate beta.

66
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,450
This approach uses cash flow information.

67
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,250
If we don't have any one of the above,

68
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,850
then we will need to use fundamental analysis

69
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,580
and judgment to guesstimate the project's beta.

70
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,890
And this approach uses fundamental information.

71
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,280
We will rely mostly on the first approach,

72
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,510
as it is often the most applicable and reliable.

73
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,310
We will demonstrate this approach

74
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,020
by considering an example.

75
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,090
Suppose that Berkshire Hathaway, an investment company,

76
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,220
is thinking about getting into a new business in oil and gas.

77
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,060
It needs to evaluate the NPV of the cash flow

78
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,990
from this business.

79
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,400
We assume that CAPM holds.

80
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,740
Then, Berkshire Hathaway's assets have a beta of 0.48.

81
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,190
What should it use as the cost of capital

82
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,100
for this new business?

83
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,590
First, Berkshire Hathaway should not

84
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,590
use the beta or required rate of return

85
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,410
on its assets to value the cash from an energy business.

86
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,410
As we know, Berkshire's assets represent

87
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,250
a very diverse portfolio ranging from financial firms,

88
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,750
like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and American Express,

89
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,490
to consumer brands, like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz,

90
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,290
to tech companies like Apple.

91
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,040
These assets have quite different risk characteristics

92
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,690
or betas as the energy sector.

93
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,740
Berkshire should use the beta of an energy company,

94
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,700
or even better, a company concentrating on oil and gas.

95
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,990
One example is ConocoPhillips, whose business

96
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,760
is mostly in gas and oil.

97
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,270
How about Exxon, another energy company?

98
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,470
As it turns out, ExxonMobil has a more diverse business

99
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,850
portfolio.

100
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:20,050
It is less of a pure play in gas and oil, as we'll see later.

101
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,190
This slide shows ConocoPhillips percentage share

102
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:31,470
of revenue from its business portfolio at the end of 2019.

103
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,280
As we can see, oil and natural gas consist

104
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,310
of 87% of its business, including natural gas liquids

105
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,260
will increase the share to 96%.

106
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,220
That is, ConocoPhillips is mostly a pure play

107
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,950
company in oil and gas.

108
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,410
The plots at the bottom of the slide

109
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:00,030
also show the performance of ConocoPhillips stock

110
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,960
over the past 10 years.

111
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,760
It's been quite unimpressive to put it mildly.

112
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,430
Nonetheless, we can use the returns

113
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,460
on ConocoPhillips' stock and bond

114
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,290
to estimate the beta of its assets, which are primarily

115
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,030
oil and gas.

116
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:24,050
It turns out to be 0.77.

117
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,780
Using a risk free rate of 5% and a market risk premium of 6%,

118
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,800
we can obtain the required rate of return for Conoco,

119
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,490
which is the expected rate of return of the project, that's

120
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,240
equal to rF, the risk free rate, plus the beta

121
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,370
of the project, that's 0.77, times the market premium, which

122
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,320
is R bar on the market minus the risk free rate.

123
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,840
If we put in numbers, that should equal to 0.05

124
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:04,040
plus 0.77 times 0.06, which is the market premium.

125
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,370
Finishing that calculation, we get 9.62%

126
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,270
for the cost of capital of Conoco,

127
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,310
which should also be the cost of capital

128
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,200
for the project, which is going to be

129
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,595
in the same line of business.

130
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:19,450


131
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,320
Before we settle on the number for the cost of capital,

132
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,660
a few more comments are in order.

133
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,650
First, we need to be mindful about the quality

134
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,320
of these estimates, including the estimates

135
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,679
for the beta, the risk free rate, and the market premium.

136
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,070
For example, the beta estimates may be noisy.

137
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,030
Second, estimates are only approximations to reality.

138
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,680
For example, beta estimates can be changing over time.

139
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,860
Does this reflect a time varying beta

140
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,800
instead of an estimation error?

141
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,630
If so, can we still use beta estimates from past data

142
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,230
to approximate for future data in obtaining cost of capital,

143
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,910
which is forward looking?

144
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,320
It will also be desirable to have a sense about how good

145
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,980
the approximations are.

146
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,190
For example, CAPM is a model aimed

147
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,460
at capturing systematic risks and risk premium.

148
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,770
It's at best a reasonable approximation for reality.

149
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,230
Is it a good enough approximation?

150
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,140
How much can we ignore the other possible risk factors?

151
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,730


152
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,740
We don't have readily available fixes to fully resolve

153
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,680
the issues raised above.

154
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,720
Nonetheless, it is important to be

155
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,770
aware of the potential limitations of the estimates

156
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,440
approximations and models when applying them.

157
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,020
Understanding these limitations will also

158
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,010
help to come up with possible remedies

159
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,640
when we need to overcome these limitations.

160
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,110
Here, I would also like to bring up an important point

161
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,580
in obtaining an asset's expected rate of return, which is also

162
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,070
related to the discussion above.

163
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,520
Given that we have identified ConocoPhillips

164
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,690
as a company with similar assets as the new business

165
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,300
under consideration, why don't we

166
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,740
just use the past returns on Conoco's assets, which

167
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,240
are traded in the market in the form of its stock and bond

168
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,560
to directly estimate its expected rate of return?

169
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,020
This way, we won't need to rely on an asset pricing

170
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,200
model like the CAPM.

171
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,280
One major reason for not relying on a return estimate

172
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,540
based on past returns is that the estimate is often

173
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,190
very noisy.

174
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,470
As we have seen from the previous slide,

175
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,490
the performance of Conoco's stock over the 2010

176
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,900
to 2020 period is almost flat.

177
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,495
We probably don't believe that the expected rate

178
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:19,640
of return on Conoco's stock is close to zero.

179
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,470
The reason why we may not want to use an asset's past returns

180
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,250
to estimate its expected return is in part

181
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,810
because the returns are very volatile or noisy.

182
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,850
This is particularly true if we use a relatively short history,

183
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,490
although 10 years in the case of Conoco

184
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:45,780
above is not that short for most companies.

185
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:51,740
Even if we have a long history on a company or an industry,

186
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,650
its expected return may well be changing over time.

187
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,810
And the past data from the very distant history

188
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,660
may not be very relevant in estimating

189
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,470
its future expected return.

190
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,280
However, estimating beta can be more accurate.

191
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,470
For example, we can use more frequent data on returns

192
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,710
to obtain better estimates for beta.

193
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,210
In other words, in the context of certain asset pricing

194
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,690
models, like the CAPM, it is easier

195
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,320
to estimate risks than expected returns.

196
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,610
In this case, we can choose to follow the model using

197
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,970
the more accurate risk estimates to obtain

198
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,300
an estimate for the required rate of return

199
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,210
for individual assets assuming we

200
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,610
have good estimates for market risk premiums.

201
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,760
As mentioned before, to obtain the cost of capital

202
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,760
for oil and gas business, we can also

203
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,450
look at ExxonMobil, which has a large share

204
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,500
of its business in oil and gas.

205
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,800
The figure on the slide shows ExxonMobil's earnings mix.

206
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,510
As we can see, 83% of ExxonMobil's earnings

207
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,960
are from oil and other upstream products,

208
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,790
like liquid natural gas.

209
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,250
However, the remaining 17% are from the downstream products

210
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,430
like fuels, lubes, and chemicals.

211
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,790
The risk of downstream products are

212
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,610
different from that of upstream products.

213
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,800
Therefore, ExxonMobil is less of a pure play in oil and gas

214
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,360
than ConocoPhillips.

215
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,330
This is why we use ConocoPhillips.

216
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,390
What happens if we cannot find pure play companies?

217
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,870
In that case, we will try to find companies

218
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,490
with a small number of business lines in their portfolios.

219
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,090
We can first estimate the betas of the portfolios

220
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,830
and then use portfolio analytics to back out the betas of each

221
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,680
of the pieces.
