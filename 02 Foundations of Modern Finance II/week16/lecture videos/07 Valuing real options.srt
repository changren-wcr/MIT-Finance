00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,860
PROFESSOR: Having discussed various types

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,520
of real options embedded in different types of investments

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,830
or projects, we now turn our attention to the evaluation.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,710
In general, the evaluation of real options

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,250
is a challenging task given the non-linear nature

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,110
of their risks.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,590
However, when the underlying asset for a real option

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,050
is traded in the financial market,

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,220
we can then apply the option valuation techniques developed

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,630
earlier for financial options to value real options.

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,810
We demonstrate this method through examples.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,350


13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,830
The first example we're going to consider

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,000
assumes a StartUp Inc, which is a biotech startup company.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,170
Its only asset is a patent on the new vaccine

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,980
with the following information.

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,600
First, if the vaccine goes into production now,

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
you will generate a sure profit of $1 million per year

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,760
for the next 17 years, which is how long the patent

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,560
protection lasts.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,490
Afterwards, the profit drops to zero.

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,920
The production requires $10 million of initial investment.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
The interest rates have a flat term structure.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,740
It's at 8% per year now, which we assumed year zero.

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,100
The interest rates can go up to 10%

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,990
or down to 5% next year, which is year one.

27
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,450
And it will remain constant afterwards.

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,310
The question we want to answer is,

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,060
what's the value of the firm or its patent?

30
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,750
The NPV of starting production today

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,530
in year zero, that is, is NPV equals 1 million,

32
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,120
which is the annual profit, divide by 8%, the discount

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,320
rate, times 1 minus 1 over 1 plus 8% to the 17th power.

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,980
And that's the present value of future profits for the 17

35
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,449
years, minus the production cost of $10 million today.

36
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:17,290
Netted out, they'll give us minus $878,362.

37
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,970
And this is a negative number.

38
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,560
Given the current interest rates,

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,210
clearly it does not make sense to produce today.

40
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,300
But is the value of the company or the patent negative

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,860
or zero, then?

42
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,090
Of course not.

43
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,630
The company has an option to produce the vaccine

44
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,260
now or later.

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,390
But not the obligation.

46
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,170
Therefore, its value must be positive.

47
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,670
What happens next year when interest rates change?

48
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,250
4% to 5%, or rise to 10%?

49
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,340


50
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,550
Let's think this through.

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,410
If interest rates increase to 10% in year one,

52
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,890
the NPV from production is still negative

53
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,920
because the present value of future profits

54
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,410
will be even smaller.

55
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,860
Therefore, we will choose not to produce

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,340
yielding zero NPV in year one.

57
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,540
However, if interest rates decrease to 5% in year one,

58
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,890
then the NPV of investing in the vaccine becomes positive.

59
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,160
Its NPV would equal 1 million divided

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,100
by 5%, the interest rates then, then 10 times 1 minus 1 over 1

61
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,160
plus 5% to the 16th power minus 10,

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,080
which is the production cost.

63
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:48,240
And that gives us positive $837,770.

64
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,320
Therefore, when interest rates fall in year one,

65
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,520
it will make sense to produce, which creates a positive value.

66
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,310
This clearly shows that the value of the firm or the patent

67
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,510
should always be positive today.

68
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,280
Putting things together, we have the following strategy.

69
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,180
If interest rates rise, investing in production

70
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,250
yields a negative NPV.

71
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,810
Consequently, we will choose not to invest resulting in NPV of 0

72
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,810
in that state.

73
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,680
If interest rates fall, investing in production

74
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,730
yields a positive NPV of $837,770.

75
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,360
Of course, in this scenario, we will produce and capture

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,550
the positive NPV.

77
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,610
How do we obtain the NPV of the patent

78
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,340
with these two scenarios?

79
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,690
We will need to find the risk neutral probabilities or state

80
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,600
prices for the two possible states.

81
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,660
Interest rates going up to 10% or down to 5%.

82
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,600
In order to do this, we need to look

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,270
at the prices of traded securities

84
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,310
whose prices are also tied to the interest rates.

85
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,940
Let's consider a 17 year risk free annuity

86
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,350
that pays $1,000 per year.

87
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,780
From the present value formula for annuities,

88
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,280
the price of this annuity today at an interest rate of 8%

89
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,130
should be S equals 1,000 divided by 8% the interest

90
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:35,760
rate times 1 minus 1 over 1 plus 8% to the 17th power.

91
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,280
Finishing the calculation, that gives us $9,122.

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,830
That is the price of this annuity today

93
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,680
at an interest rate of 8%.

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,160
Next year, if the interest rates go up to 10%,

95
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,560
the value of this annuity becomes

96
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,010
Sd, that's the price in a down state,

97
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:01,230
equals 1,000, that's the payment then, plus the present value

98
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,000
of future payments of $16,000 in total.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,150
If we finish this equation, we will get $8,824.

100
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,430
That is also equal to d, the gross return on this asset,

101
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,460
times S, its current price.

102
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,560
And this gives d of 0.967.

103
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,790
If the interest rates go down to 5%, the value of this annuity

104
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:38,940
becomes Su equals 1,000 plus 1,000 over 5% times 1 minus 1

105
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,200
over 1.05 raised to the 16th power.

106
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,170
Finishing the calculation, we get $11,838.

107
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,920
That's should equal to u, the gross return on the asset,

108
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,690
in upstate times S, its current price.

109
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,610
This gives u of 1.298.

110
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,400
With u and d, and the risk free rate, RF,

111
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,430
we can find the risk neutral probability q

112
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,390
for the state in which interest rates dropped to 5%.

113
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,450
Remember that the risk neutral probability

114
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,700
is the probability under which the expected return on annuity

115
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,940
is the same as the one year risk free rate, which is 8%.

116
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:34,740
We then have Q equals to 1 plus RF minus d divide by u minus d.

117
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,980
That's the standard formula for risk neutral probabilities.

118
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,150
Plug in the numbers.

119
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:50,910
That gives us 1.08 minus 0.967 divided by 1.298 minus 0.967.

120
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:57,780
Finishing that calculation, that gives us q of 0.341.

121
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,150
The value of the investment opportunity

122
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,170
today is then given by its expected payoff

123
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,470
under the risk neutral probabilities discounted

124
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,320
at the risk free rate.

125
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,350
This is the risk neutral pricing we

126
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,980
have learned in the lecture on option pricing.

127
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,570
PV zero, then, of this pattern should equal to its value

128
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:29,560
in the upstate, which is 833,770, times the risk

129
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,580
neutral probability for that state, which is 0.341 plus 0,

130
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,134
which is valued in the downstate times the risk

131
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:43,740
neutral probability.

132
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,900
Then, divide that by 1 plus the risk free rate,

133
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:54,920
this gives us $264,518.

134
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,330
In this example, we see that even though the project's cash

135
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,860
flow is risk free, its value can change with the interest

136
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,310
rates, which creates a substantial option

137
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,680
value for the firm's asset.

138
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,280
This option value, which is 221,693

139
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,090
comes from the firm's ability to use the patent when

140
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,850
interest rates fall and the value from production

141
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,590
becomes positive.

142
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,760
This option can be viewed as a growth option or a timing

143
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,310
option.
