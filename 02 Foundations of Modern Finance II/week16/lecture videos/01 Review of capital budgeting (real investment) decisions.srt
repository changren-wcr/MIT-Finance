1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,700
PROFESSOR: We have spent a great deal of effort

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,840
to understand how the financial market values different assets,

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,940
real or financial.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,430
In particular, we have learned how

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,400
the time value of money and the risk premium

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,090
are provided by the prices of a rich set of traded

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,570
assets in the financial market.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,260
These pricing information provides the basis for us

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,010
to value different assets, projects, and prospects

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,229
in real economic activities.

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,320
We have also developed methods and models

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,140
to analyze and measure risks.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,530
In particular, we have learned that there

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,440
are two kinds of risks, systematic risks

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,990
and nonsystematic risks.

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,110
More importantly, it is the systematic risk

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,910
that leads to a required risk premium by the market.

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,800
Using risk models like the APT and the CAPM

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,580
we can further pin down the systemic risk factors

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,800
and their risk premiums.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,880
We can then determine the risk premium of an asset

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,700
by its exposure to the systematic risks.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,300
In addition, when an asset's risk

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,920
is nonlinear, such as in the case of options,

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,790
we have further developed option valuation or state price

26
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,320
valuation tools to price them accordingly.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,470
What we will return to next is to apply

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,740
the risk analysis and valuation tools

29
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,620
as well as various financial instruments

30
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,080
available in the financial market

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,960
to help us make and implement corporate financial decisions.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,950
As we have discussed in part 1 of this course,

33
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,120
corporate financial decisions fall into four categories.

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,450
The first is about real investments,

35
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,250
or capital budgeting, namely, what projects to invest in.

36
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,500
This decision involves estimates of an investment's cash flow,

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,100
the appropriate discount rates in valuing the cash flow,

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,140
and possible optionality embedded in it.

39
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,460
The second category of decisions is financing.

40
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,660
Financing decisions is about how a firm should raise

41
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,760
funds for its investments--

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,520
by issuing different types of financial claims,

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,710
bank loans, corporate bonds, stocks, et cetera.

44
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,210
The third is payout.

45
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,660
That is, how a firm should pay its shareholders

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,540
in terms of dividends, stock buybacks, and so on.

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,570
The fourth category is risk management,

48
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,140
how a firm should deal with various types of risks

49
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,300
it faces.

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,380
We covered in detail the first part of capital budgeting,

51
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,980
focusing primarily in cash flow analysis.

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,020
In this part of the course, we will

53
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,200
consider the remaining parts of capital budgeting

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,950
and the other three types of corporate financial decisions.

55
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,970
Again, we will start with a firm's investment or capital

56
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,950
budgeting decisions.

57
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,130
As we discussed before, the investment decision

58
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,710
is about the valuation of the projects under consideration.

59
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,960
In particular, we should follow the NPV rule.

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,270
That is, for a single project, we

61
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,770
should take it only if its cash flow has a positive Net Present

62
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,640
Value.

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,580
For multiple independent projects,

64
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,520
we should take all the projects with positive NPVs.

65
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,130
For mutually exclusive projects, we

66
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,950
should take the one with the highest NPV,

67
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,870
assuming it's also positive.

68
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,870
Therefore, the capital budgeting decision

69
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,690
really boils down to estimating the projects' NPVs.

70
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,900
The NPV of a project depends on three factors.

71
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,050
The first is its cash flow.

72
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,709
The second is the appropriate discount rates

73
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,630
for its cash flow.

74
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,810
And the last is the potential optionality

75
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,040
embedded in the project.

76
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,340
We have examined item one in detail

77
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,630
in part 1 of this course.

78
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,040
We will now focus on item two and three

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,160
with the risk analysis and asset pricing tools

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,340
we have developed.
