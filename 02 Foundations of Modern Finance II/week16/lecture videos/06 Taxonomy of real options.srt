00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720


1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,520
What we will do next is to provide a simple categorization

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,300
of different types of real options frequently encountered

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,300
in real investments.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,230
In identifying important optionality in projects,

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,680
we need to carefully consider project characteristics

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,010
such as different phases, scenarios

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,460
and strategic investments.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,660
In particular, we should examine the pattern of cash flows

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,220
and expenditures over time and in different states,

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,780
and what optionality we may have in modifying them.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,230
For example, large expenditures are likely to be discretionary.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,270
The types of real options can be roughly categorized as follows.

13
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,210
Growth option refers to the option

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,060
to grow a project or asset.

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,280
Abandonment option refers to the option

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,990
to abandon a project like the copper mine

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,640
example we just considered.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,100
Option to expand and reduce scale.

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,430
A timing option, which refers to the option

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,910
to launch a project at different points in time.

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:25,140
An option to switch inputs, outputs, processes et cetera.

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,420
Such a taxonomy is not absolute and complete.

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,170
It is mostly for convenience and exposition.

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,380
There can be overlaps between the different types

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,320
and also more complex options.

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,270
Next, we will consider some examples of these options.

27
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,420
We start with growth options.

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,350
An investment or project contains a growth option

29
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,040
if it allows follow-up investments, which

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,160
can be determined later based on newly arrived information.

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,940
This optionality, not a commitment in follow-up

32
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,500
investments, is the key here.

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,950
The growth option clearly has positive value,

34
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,830
a basic property of options.

35
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,200
Therefore, it needs to be included

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,850
in valuing the project.

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,000
Projects with highly valuable growth options

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,200
are often viewed as having strategic value, value

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,480
from future investment opportunities

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,460
beyond the cash flow from current investments.

41
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,110
The idea of growth options here is very much the same

42
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,740
as the idea we introduced in stock valuation

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,330
in part 1 of this course.

44
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,980
There, we try to value these options using

45
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,730
a direct discounted cash flow approach.

46
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,150
Such an approach, although conceptually correct,

47
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,430
can be hard to implement.

48
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,350
This is because options have nonlinear risk characteristics.

49
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,580
Finding the right discount rate is not trivial.

50
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,250
But with the option valuation methodology

51
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,920
we have developed earlier, we can value

52
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,645
these options more handily.

53
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:21,200


54
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,650
We can easily list many examples of growth options, R&D

55
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,880
for example, which can lead to profitable applications

56
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:38,230
if successful, movies which can lead to sequels if popular,

57
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:46,920
investing in emerging markets, exploring oil drills and so on.

58
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,970
Growth options are akin to call options.

59
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,210
You have the option but not the obligation

60
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,830
to obtain an asset by paying a cost.

61
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,170
It is worth noting that growth options can be nested.

62
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,470
In the case of movies, one sequel

63
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,530
could give you the option for the following

64
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,180
sequel, like Rocky I could lead to Rocky II

65
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,860
could lead to Rocky III.

66
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,120
For certain industries, businesses and projects

67
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,850
growth options can be very valuable,

68
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,760
accounting for over half of the market

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,840
value of some industries, for example,

70
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,840
industries with heavy R&D like high tech or pharmaceuticals,

71
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,640
industries with multiple product generations like computers,

72
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,080
software and also pharmaceuticals,

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,850
or platforms like Amazon or Facebook.

74
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,510
A project contains an abandonment option

75
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,650
if it can be shut down by choice.

76
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:07,490
Abandonment options can be hidden in aggregate forecasts.

77
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,470
While it may be preferable to continue operations on average,

78
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,530
shutting down can be desirable under some scenarios.

79
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,400
The option to do so can avoid large losses

80
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,780
or disastrous situations which can be very valuable.

81
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,640
Obviously, abandonment options are just put options.

82
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,250
You have the option but the obligation

83
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,450
to get rid of something and receive a payment, which

84
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,390
is the liquidation value.

85
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,810
Scale options refer to the flexibility

86
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,930
in adjusting the scale of your operations

87
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,040
when conditions change.

88
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,320
For example, when conditions are more favorable than expected,

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,480
the firm can scale up production or speed up resource usage.

90
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,720
When conditions are less favorable than expected,

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,130
do the reverse or even temporarily halt operations.

92
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,000
In many ways, scale options are similar to growth

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
and abandonment options.

94
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,940
Examples include the ability to slow

95
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,760
the rate of mineral extraction from a mine,

96
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,660
for example, or the ability to add a temporary third shift

97
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,770
at a plant.

98
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,690
The timing of an investment is sometimes flexible.

99
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,420
This timing option can be very valuable

100
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,900
as we have seen in the copper mine example.

101
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,320
Another example is a building permit when you have the option

102
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,270
to choose when to build within the permit's lifetime.

103
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,520
The value of the permit should factor

104
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,720
in this timing flexibility, which can be very important.

105
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,520
The timing option is akin to an American call option.

106
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,730
Its owner has the right but not the obligation

107
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,830
to obtain an asset at any time within a given window

108
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,140
by paying a cost, which is the exercise price.

109
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,810
As said earlier, the timing option

110
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,960
is valuable only when future information can be useful.

111
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,320
Timing options are particularly important

112
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,655
for the following industries or projects--

113
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:38,370
all R&D intensive industries like pharmaceuticals,

114
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,540
long development and capital-intensive projects

115
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,070
like large-scale construction and power plants,

116
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,520
or start-up ventures.
