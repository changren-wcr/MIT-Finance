1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,530
PROFESSOR: As discussed before, given an asset or its cash

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,680
flow, discount rates over different time horizons

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,770
are, in general, different.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,560
In this part of our discussion, we

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,700
would like to better understand the underlying reasons for this

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,250
and how to deal with it.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,480
The term structure of discount rates arises for two reasons.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,410
First, the term structure of interest rates.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,259
That is, the market gives different interest

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,000
rates for different horizons.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,450
One year interest rate is, in general, different

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,870
from the 10 year interest rate.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,380
This simply reflects the different rates of return

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,650
the market expects for save cash flows

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,680
at different future dates.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,230
In our analysis of the fixed income

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,120
market in part one of this course,

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,280
we also discussed the underlying factors influencing

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,890
the interest rate curve.

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,430
Here, for our purpose, we will take the interest rate curve

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,080
as given.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,930
The second reason is that the term structure

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,290
of risk premium for a given asset or cash flow

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,140
is, in general, not flat either.

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,260
This can come from two sources.

26
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,070
The first is that the risk of the cash flow,

27
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,560
in particular, the systematic risk,

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,070
can be different for the different pieces of the cash

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,670
flow at different dates.

30
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,640
The second is that the corresponding risk

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,300
premium can also differ.

32
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,090
Therefore, a sufficient condition

33
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,940
for flat term structure of discount rates

34
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,240
is that the term structure of interest rates is flat

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,690
and also the term structure of risk premiums is flat as well.

36
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,120
In general, these two conditions are hard to satisfy.

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,090
In what follows, we further consider under what

38
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,610
conditions we may get a flat term

39
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,730
structure for risk premiums.

40
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,180
It heavily depends on how risks accumulate

41
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,450
over time for the asset or project

42
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,310
and how the price of risk varies with the time horizon.

43
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,920
We do so by considering an example.

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,410
Suppose that the CAPM holds and the risk premium on the market

45
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,410
portfolio is 8%, the risk free rate

46
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,000
is 4%, both constant over time and over different time

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,530
horizons.

48
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,280
Therefore, the market's time value for money and price

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,840
of risk have a flat term structure.

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,070
We only focus on how the risk of an asset's cash flow

51
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,170
may vary over different time horizons.

52
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,320
Let's suppose that we are now in year zero

53
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,230
and consider a financial contract which

54
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,850
pays a cash flow in two years, that is, year two.

55
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,110
The cash flow CF2 is given by the ratio

56
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,610
between the value of S&P 500 index in year two

57
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,230
and its value in year one.

58
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,840
Ignoring dividends and assume that S&P 500 index represents

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,030
the market portfolio.

60
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,640
This ratio is simply the gross rate

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,940
of return on the market portfolio in year two.

62
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,950
That is, 1 plus RM2.

63
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,090
The question for us is, what should the current price

64
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,650
of this cash flow be?

65
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,350
Let's consider this step by step.

66
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,550
First, let's try to find its price in year one.

67
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:53,570
That is, the present value of CF2 in year one.

68
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,240
The expected value of CF2 in year one

69
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:03,350
is simply 1 plus the expectation in year one of RM2,

70
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,950
which is return on the market in year two.

71
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,790
Where the expectation is taken year one.

72
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,899
This is also just 1 plus R bar on the market.

73
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,880
That's expected gross rate of return on the market portfolio.

74
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,580
Here, as usual, we assume the returns on the market portfolio

75
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,730
are RID over time.

76
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,840
In order to obtain its present value in year one,

77
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,910
we need the right discount rate.

78
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,170
Since the cash flow has the same risk as the market portfolio,

79
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,180
it's required rate of return should

80
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,320
be the same as the market portfolio.

81
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,560
Putting the two pieces together, the present value

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,460
of CF2 in year one is simply its expected value,

83
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,040
which is 1 plus R bar M discounted at the markets

84
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,840
expect of rate of return, which is also R bar M. It, then,

85
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,670
will give us $1 for sure.

86
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,600
In other words, the price of this cash flow in year one

87
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,650
is simply $1 with no uncertainty.

88
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,750
This should not be surprising.

89
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,200
If we have $1 in year one for sure,

90
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,610
we can easily invest it in the market portfolio for one year

91
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,350
and then obtain 1 plus RM2, which is CF2.

92
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,940


93
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,020
Next, we need to find the present value of this cash flow

94
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,450
now, that is, in year zero.

95
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,660
This should be straightforward given

96
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,510
that the value of CF2 in year one is $1 with no uncertainty.

97
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,460
The right discount rate should be the risk free rate,

98
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,120
which is 4%.

99
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,050
Writing this out, we have the first equation

100
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:08,250
that is PV0 equals $1 discounted at 4%, which gives us

101
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,230
96.15 cents.

102
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,870
The second equation on the slide further

103
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,830
expresses the present value at time 0

104
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,930
in terms of the expected value of CF2 discounted back

105
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,490
over the two periods, year one and year two.

106
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,620
What we see from the second equation

107
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,970
is that the discount rates for the two periods are different.

108
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:41,360
It is RBM for the second period and RF for the first period.

109
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,090
The reason for two discount rates

110
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,290
is that CF2 is risky only during period two,

111
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,380
not during period one.

112
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,080
This example tells us that in order

113
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,000
to have the same risk adjusted discount rates for both periods

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,260
the cash flow will need to bear risks in both periods

115
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,710
and in certain ways.

116
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:12,380
We demonstrate this last point also by an example.

117
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,430
We now consider another financial contract,

118
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,760
which pays in two years a cash flow that

119
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,320
equals the ratio between the S&P 500 index then

120
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,450
and its value today.

121
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,110
It's cash flow, CF2, can also be written

122
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,660
as the product of the gross returns of S&P 500 index

123
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,580
over year one and year two.

124
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:48,250
That is, CF2 equals S&P year two divided by S&P in year zero

125
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,030
and equals the product of the gross return

126
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,130
on the market over these two years.

127
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,220
Clearly, CF2 is risky.

128
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,520
Its risk is related to the market risk

129
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,980
in both year one and year two.

130
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,980
This differs from the previous contract

131
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,430
whose risk is only related to the market risk in year two.

132
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,810
Let us now try to value this cash flow.

133
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,390
Again, we start at year one.

134
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,210
The present value of CF2 in year one

135
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,090
is given by the following discounted cash flow formula.

136
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,679
The numerator is the expected value of CF2 in year one.

137
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,659
It is simply the gross return on the market over year one.

138
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:44,500
That is, 1 plus RM1, which is known in year one times

139
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,490
the expected gross return on the market over year two, which

140
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,500
is 1 plus E1 of RM2.

141
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,120
The denominator is 1 plus the appropriate discount rate.

142
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,980
Since the cash flow has the same risk as the market,

143
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,700
the discount rate should simply be the required rate of return

144
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,740
on the market portfolio, which is

145
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,570
R bar M. Therefore, the denominator becomes

146
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,510
1 plus R bar M.

147
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,510
Since the expected gross return on the market

148
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:26,750
is also 1 plus R bar M, we then have PV1 of CF2

149
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,280
is 1 plus RM1, which is simply the gross return

150
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,360
on the market in year one.

151
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,825
We didn't consider the present value of this cash flow

152
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:40,200
in year zero.

153
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,870
Since the value of this asset in year one, which is 1 plus RM1

154
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,760
has the same risk as the market, its present value today

155
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,240
is simply its expected value today

156
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,340
discounted at the expected rate of return on the market.

157
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,120
The expected value of PV1 today is the gross return

158
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,350
on the market.

159
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:12,930
We then have PV of 0 equals 1 plus E0 of RM1 divided by 1

160
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,980
plus the expected value of RM1.

161
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,390
Finished in the calculation, that gives us $1.

162
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,820
This result is not surprising.

163
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,860
If we have a dollar today and invest it in S&P 500

164
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,950
for two years, the resulting cash flow

165
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,990
is exactly CF2, again, ignoring dividends.

166
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,140
We can rewrite the present value of CF2

167
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,580
in the form of the last equation on the slide.

168
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,590
PV0 of CF2 equals the expectation

169
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:58,600
at 0 of CF2 divided by 1 plus the expected value of RM1

170
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,570
times 1 plus the expected value of RM2.

171
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,210


172
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:09,760
That equals-- again, expected value of CF2 divided by 1 plus

173
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,250
R bar M squared.

174
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,550
Finished in the calculation, that gives us $1.

175
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,360
In this equation, we are using the same discount rate

176
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,390
for both year one and year two.

177
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,170
Given that we assume a flat interest rate curve,

178
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,230
this also implies a constant risk premium

179
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,030
for different horizons and periods.

180
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,630
The reason this is the case is that, for the cash

181
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,890
flow under consideration, which is CF2 here,

182
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,730
its risks over the two periods are the same

183
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,460
and are compounding on each other.

184
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,420
Therefore, we can use the same risk-adjusted discount

185
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,010
rate for both periods assuming a constant risk-free rate

186
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,950
and a constant price of risk, which

187
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,170
is the premium on the market portfolio.

188
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,310
The above two examples show that in addition

189
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,370
to assuming constant time value of money

190
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,270
in price of risk for different future periods,

191
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,630
a constant discount rate is justifiable

192
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,770
if the risks of a cash flow is compounding

193
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,420
at a constant rate over time.

194
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,690
Some assets or cash flows may have their risks

195
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,460
evolving in this fashion over time,

196
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,890
such as the value of a stock.

197
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,700
But not all assets, are like this

198
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,040
such as risk-free government bonds.

199
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,680
In our NPV analysis, we have to be

200
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,580
mindful of the various approximations we are making,

201
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,730
their limitations, and possible remedies when needed.
