00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
PROFESSOR: Let's consider a simple example of real options.

1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,930
UW, Inc., a mining company, is considering buying a copper

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,560
mine with the following data.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,120
The mine can produce 10 million kilograms of copper.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,850
Copper extraction will take one year

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:29,420
at a cost of $5.4 per kilogram paid up front.

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,290
Copper price today is $6 per kilogram.

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,730
Copper price next year can either increase by 30%

8
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,190
or decrease by 20%, with equal probability.

9
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,830
The uncertainty about copper price

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,380
is fully resolved next year.

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,340
That is, copper price will stay constant afterwards.

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,890
We're going to further assume copper price

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,200
risk is purely idiosyncratic.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,480
The risk-free rate in the market is 5%.

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,980
The question we would like to answer

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,610
is, what is the NPV of this mine?

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:20,530
This will be the highest price UW is willing to pay.

18
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,760
The NPV depends on what UW does with the mine

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,990
after acquiring it.

20
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,320
We consider two possible strategies.

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,370
The first is to extract the copper now.

22
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,540
And the second is to extract next year.

23
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,480
Extracting now, we have the following.

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,950
The expected cash flow next year per kilo of copper

25
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,260
is 1/2 times 6, which is the current copper price, times 1

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,850
plus 30%--

27
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,150
that will be the expected price of copper next year

28
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,590
if it goes up--

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,940
plus 6 times 1 minus 20%.

30
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,820
That will give us the price if the copper price goes down

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,650
next year.

32
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,120
Averaging the two gives us the expected copper price

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,350
next year.

34
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,430
And it is 1/2 times 7.8 plus 4.8.

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,420
And that gives us $6.3 per kilo.

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,630
Since the copper risk is idiosyncratic,

37
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,760
we can simply use the risk-free rate as the discount rate.

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,540
The NPV per kilogram of copper is then

39
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,230
NPV 0 equals minus 5.4--

40
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,450
that's the extraction cost--

41
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,980
plus 6.3-- that's the expected copper price next year--

42
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,870
discounted at 5%.

43
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,220
That gives us $0.60 per kilogram of copper.

44
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,240
What if the risk is not diversifiable?

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,750
Then we cannot simply use the risk-free rate to do

46
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,400
the discounting.

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,550
We would have to use state prices to discount

48
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,020
the future cash flows.

49
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,610
We will deal with this situation a bit later.

50
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,160
Now, let's consider the strategy of extracting next year.

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,870
That is year 1.

52
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,270
We have two states for year 1--

53
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,950
up and down-- representing the state in which the copper

54
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,370
price goes up or it goes down.

55
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,880
In the upper state, the project's NPV

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,850
in year 1 per kilogram, again, is NPV 1 in up state

57
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,710
equals minus 5.4--

58
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,480
again, that's the extraction cost--

59
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,190
plus 7.8-- that's the copper price in the up state--

60
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,190
discounted at 5%, because we are getting the copper

61
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,380
a year later.

62
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,720
Finishing the calculation, we have $2.03.

63
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,140
In the down state, the project's NPV in year 1

64
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,420
is given by the following equation.

65
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,410
That is NPV in the down state equals minus 5.4,

66
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,800
same as before, plus 4.8, the copper

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,130
price in the down state in one year, discounted

68
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,070
at the 5% risk-free rate.

69
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,980
That gives us minus $0.83 per kilogram.

70
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,090
These are the present values in year 1

71
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,070
in both the up and down state, respectively.

72
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,080
Discounting back to year 0, again using the risk-free rate,

73
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,020
we obtain the project's NPV today.

74
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,660
That's in year 0.

75
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,520
NPV 0 equals 1/2 times the NPV in year 1--

76
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
in the up state--

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,490
plus the NPV 1 in the down state, discounted

78
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,420
at the risk-free rate of 5%.

79
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,780
Plug in the numbers.

80
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,290
We get 1 over 1.05 times minus 5.4,

81
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:13,630
again, extraction cost, plus 1/2 of the expected copper price.

82
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,550
That's the average between 7.8 and 4.8.

83
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,040
We then discounted that back at the 5% risk-free rate.

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:30,550
Finishing the calculation, we are getting $0.57 per kilogram.

85
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,960
This, of course, is lower than the NPV if we extract now.

86
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,730
Therefore, waiting for a year to extract yields a lower NPV.

87
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,700
Using the naive discounted cash flow analysis,

88
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,830
we arrive at the following.

89
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,340
The mine has a positive NPV.

90
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,900
It is better to start the extraction now than wait.

91
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,290
The NPV of the mine is 10 million--

92
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,060
that's the total amount of copper--

93
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,340
times $0.60.

94
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,880
That's the NPV per kilo.

95
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,560
That gives us $6 million in total.

96
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,410
This actually will be the NPV of the mine.

97
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,330
And this will be the highest price

98
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,320
UW should be willing to pay.

99
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,470
The question is, is this the best we can do?

100
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,510
Let's think this over.

101
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,130
In the previous calculation, if we wait and the copper price

102
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:41,200
goes up, extraction gives an NPV in year 1 of $2.03 per kilo,

103
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,500
as computed before.

104
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,130
If, however, the copper price goes down,

105
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:54,760
extraction gives an NPV of minus $0.83 per kilo.

106
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,060
But wait a minute.

107
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,810
In this case, it does not make sense to extract.

108
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,520
If we have the option not to extract in the down state,

109
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,920
we should then simply abandon the mine,

110
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,130
resulting in NPV of 0, not a loss.

111
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,440
Taking this option into account, we

112
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,410
obtain the NPV of the mine in year 0

113
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:25,925
to be NPV 0 equals 1/2 times the NPV in year 1 for the up

114
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:29,870
state plus the NPV in year 1 for the down state

115
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,650
and then discounted at the risk-free rate.

116
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,680
Given that the NPV in year 1 for the down state

117
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,960
will be $0 if we abandon the mine,

118
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,570
the calculation will give us $0.97 per kilo for NPV of $0.

119
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,610
As a result, the NPV of the mine is then 10 million kilos

120
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,110
of copper in total times $0.97 per kilo,

121
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,420
which is the NPV at time 0 for each kilo of copper.

122
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,580
That gives us $9.7 million in total.

123
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,350
This is higher than the NPV of $6 million

124
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:18,450
if we extract right away.

125
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,380
Therefore, with the option to abandon the mine in year 1

126
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,340
if copper price goes down yields the following optimal strategy.

127
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,750
Don't extract now.

128
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,690
But wait until next year.

129
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,909
If the copper price goes up, we extract.

130
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,539
Otherwise, we don't.

131
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,510
The calculation above shows that the option

132
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:49,240
to wait and abandon in the bad state to avoid losses

133
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,190
can significantly change the mine's value today.

134
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,190
This example demonstrates that when

135
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,240
we can alter our decisions based on new information,

136
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,170
like learning about copper price in one year,

137
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,430
the corresponding optionality is important in the valuation

138
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,290
of a project.

139
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,950
In terms of how to value these options,

140
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,790
there are two approaches.

141
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,770
The first-- it's so-called the dynamic NPV, which takes into

142
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,510
account the optimal decisions along each node of the decision

143
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,240
tree.

144
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,590
The second approach is option pricing.

145
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,270
In the above example, the mine can be viewed as a call option

146
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,130
on copper, which can be exercised either in year 0

147
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,540
or in year 1.

148
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,940
This is an American call.

149
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,570
The strike price is simply the extraction cost.

150
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,710
Given the binomial price process for copper,

151
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:00,640
we can easily value this option.

152
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,000
We will discuss more of this approach later in this lecture.
