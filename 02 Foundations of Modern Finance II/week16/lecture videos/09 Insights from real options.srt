PROFESSOR: Summarizing our analysis

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,800
we obtained several important points.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,090
First, the naive discounted cash flow analysis

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,440
tends to underestimate the value of strategic options embedded

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,810
in real investments.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,730
Next, projects often contain various types of options.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,880
Follow-on projects are like American calls.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,240
Abandonment options are like American puts.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,290
Scale options are like conversion options or calls

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,850
and puts.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,620
Timing options are like American calls.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,430
It is in general difficult to apply this kind of cash

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,450
flow calculations to value real options.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,640
When the underlying asset is traded,

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,950
however, we can value real options

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,980
by using market prices of the underlying asset.

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,980
The examples we considered in this lecture

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,100
all fall into this category.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,200
More generally, instead of thinking

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,850
about a firm's investments as a process of acquiring

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,420
and disposing assets, we can think of them

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,620
as a process of acquiring and disposing of options

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,050
and exercising the options optimally.
