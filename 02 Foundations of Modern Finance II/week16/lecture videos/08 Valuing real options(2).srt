1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,760
PROFESSOR: Next, we consider another example

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,170
in which the real option is embedded in a project's

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,760
follow on projects.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,810
The setting is in 1993, MC Inc., which

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,230
is a tech company in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,010
is considering whether to enter the PC business, which

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,590
is taking off at the time.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,980
At that point, we have the following information.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,790
The R&D department has developed a new PC model.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:37,540
Let's call that model A. If launched now, which is 1990,

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,240
the cash flow for model A is given

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:47,860
in the table on the slide, which spans from 1990 to 1995.

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,520
The second row gives the net investments needed.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,520
In particular, the initial investment is $450 million,

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,500
which is quite substantial.

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,850
Further investments of $50 million and $100 million

17
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,940
are needed in the following two years.

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,180
In the last two years, 1994 and 1995, they turn positive.

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,070
The after-tax operating profit is then given in the third row.

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:26,320
It is $140 million in 1991, $159 million in 1992, and so on.

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,290
The net cash flow is given in the last row

22
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:35,680
in the table minus $450 million in 1990, plus $90 million

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,200
in 1991, $59 million in 1992, et cetera.

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,630
Therefore, after the initial investment,

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,360
net cash will turn positive in the following years.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,670
Suppose the cost of capital for the PC business is 20%.

27
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,430
The NPV of launching model A is given by its NPV, which

28
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,639
equal to minus $450, the initial investment, plus $90,

29
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,580
which is the profit in year 1 divided

30
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,550
by 1 plus 20%, the cost of capital,

31
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,570
plus $59, the profit in year 2 divided

32
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:26,130
by 1 plus the cost of capital, 20% to the power 2, and so on.

33
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:33,075
If we finish the calculation, we get minus $42 million.

34
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:35,820
Clearly, model A is a loser.

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,360
Its NPV is negative.

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,840
However, we also have the following information.

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,550
Launching model A in 1990 will put MC Inc.

38
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,120
into the PC business and allow it

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,940
to introduce model B in 1993.

40
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,100
The expected cash flow for model B

41
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,660
is similar to that of model A, but twice as large.

42
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,330
Since model A is a loser, so would

43
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,660
be model B. Its expected NPV would be twice as negative.

44
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,230
But there are future scenarios in which model

45
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,260
B yields large payoffs.

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,720
The table on this slide lists some

47
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,900
of these positive scenarios for model B,

48
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:31,000
captured by its NPV in 1993 at the time of its launch.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,750
The second row gives the benchmark scenario

50
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,790
in which model B's NPV will be minus $84 million, twice

51
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,450
that of model A.

52
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,480
However, after the launch of model A,

53
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,100
MC Inc. may get better with the PC business.

54
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,170
The initial investment for model B

55
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,130
can be substantially lower than currently expected,

56
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,710
say 30% lower.

57
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,830
This will then leave the NPV of model B

58
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:07,280
to be positive $178 million in 1993.

59
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,790
Or the sales of model B can be 40% higher

60
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,540
than the current forecast, due to the unexpected success

61
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,940
of model A and of model B itself.

62
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,019
Or, profit margin becomes 50% higher than expected,

63
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,350
as MC Inc. gets more efficient with the PC

64
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,940
production over model A phase.

65
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,580
These are all good scenarios, reasonable

66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,910
and beyond our current expectations.

67
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,780
Of course, they are many bad scenarios, too, also reasonable

68
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,210
and beyond expectations.

69
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,100
Averaging over all these scenarios,

70
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,640
we will have the benchmark scenario, which

71
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,290
is the current expectation.

72
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,430
And it's negative.

73
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,210
The ultimate question is still if MC Inc.

74
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,670
should launch model A. In expected terms,

75
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:04,610
model B loses $84 million, doubling the loss of model A.

76
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:10,660
How can this change the decision on model A today?

77
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,040
The plot on the slide shows the probability distribution

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,830
of model B's NPV in 1993 across different scenarios then.

79
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:28,280
The x-axis is model B's NPV in 1993 in billion dollars.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,170
It is uncertain today, in 1990, and can take different values

81
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,620
in 1993.

82
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,830
The y-axis gives the corresponding probability

83
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,760
density for these values.

84
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,690
To the right of 0 are the good scenarios in which model

85
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,830
B will have positive NPVs in 1993.

86
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,340
To the left of 0 are the bad scenarios.

87
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,670
From the plot, we make two observations.

88
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,550
First, the bad scenarios are more likely,

89
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,420
since they have higher probability weights.

90
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,350
Average over all scenarios, we will obtain the expected value

91
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:16,160
of minus $84 million, which is slightly to the left of 0.

92
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,700
Second, the distribution is very wide.

93
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,000
With fairly high probability, the NPV

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,880
can be higher than, say, $250 million, or $0.25 billion.

95
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:38,320
Similarly, it can be lower than, say, minus $250 million.

96
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,310
This means that there is a lot of uncertainty or volatility

97
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,140
in model B's NPV, or value, going forward.

98
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,750
This last observation is important.

99
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,530
First, we know that the decision to stop model B is in 1993,

100
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,120
not now.

101
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,670
This is different for model A. Therefore,

102
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:08,510
model B should be viewed as an option, not a commitment.

103
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,630
In particular, as long as MC Inc.

104
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,370
can abandon model B in 1993, only the right-hand side

105
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,680
of the distribution matters.

106
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,980
In other words, we only need to care

107
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,780
about the good scenarios of model B, or its upside.

108
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,380
The bad scenarios don't matter, since we can avoid them,

109
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:35,000
if they turn out to be the case, by simply not doing model B.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,090
Therefore, model B being an option only

111
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,380
has positive value, at least, not negative.

112
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,430
Moreover, since the right-hand side of the NPV distribution

113
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,660
is huge, it's option value can be substantial,

114
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,300
even though the chance of ending up there is less than 50%.

115
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,040
Let's now consider how to value model B as a real option.

116
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,660
For this purpose, we need to add a few more assumptions.

117
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,050
These assumptions will stay on the conservative side

118
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,460
to avoid producing inflated outcomes.

119
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,690
First, we'll assume that the decision on model B

120
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,230
has to be made in 1993.

121
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,900
MC Inc. cannot keep waiting.

122
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,470
As we know, extending the lifetime of an option

123
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,550
increases its value.

124
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,450
Two, in order to launch model B in 1993,

125
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,289
MC Inc. has to launch model A in 1990.

126
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,270
In other words, launching model A later is very expensive.

127
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,330
Waiting on model A also adds value.

128
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,640
And we want to limit that.

129
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,910
Three, MC Inc. has the option to stop model B in 1993.

130
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,080
Thus, possible losses for model B is limited.

131
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,610
As we have learned, this is a very critical assumption.

132
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,290
As stated before, the initial investment in 1993,

133
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,840
year model B, is $900 million, twice that of model A's, which

134
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,520
is $450 million.

135
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,800
And it's assumed to be fixed.

136
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,460
The net cash flow, or profit of model B after its initial year,

137
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,970
which is 1993, is twice that of Model A's.

138
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:39,730
It is $180 million in 1994, $118 million in 1995, and so on.

139
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,730
We can view model B's profits as an underlying asset.

140
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,290
At 20% cost of capital, the NPV of this asset,

141
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,300
that is, model B's net profits, discounted back to 1990

142
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:01,580
is 1 over 1 plus 20% to the power 3.

143
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,680
This is to discount its present value

144
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,630
from 1993 to 1990 times the present value

145
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,230
of its future profits in 1993.

146
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:19,010
That is, 180 divided by 1 plus 0.2 plus 118

147
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,330
divided by 1 plus 0.2 square, and so on.

148
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:32,510
If we finish this calculation, we get PV0 to be $472 million.

149
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,050
Therefore, model B is really a call option

150
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:42,360
on an asset whose current value is $472 million

151
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,270
with a strike price of $900 million,

152
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:51,550
which is the initial investment, and a maturity of three years.

153
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,380
To value this option, we need the volatility of this asset.

154
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,350
That is, the volatility of its value over time.

155
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,120
Since this asset is not directly traded in the financial market,

156
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,360
we look for similar assets traded in the market

157
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,190
and use their price volatility as an approximation.

158
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,690
Dell, for example, is a pure play company in the PC business

159
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,980
then whose shares are traded.

160
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,280
Dell's share price has an annual volatility of 35%.

161
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,790
We will use this to approximate the volatility

162
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,170
of the present value of model B's net profits.

163
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:42,140
The risk free interest rate was 9% in 1990.

164
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,040
With the assumptions above, we can value the opportunity

165
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,590
to launch model B in 1993 as a three year European call

166
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,720
option with the following specifications.

167
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,760
The strike price is $900 million,

168
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,670
the initial investment.

169
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,830
The underlying asset is the profit stream for model B.

170
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,220
The present value of the underlying asset now,

171
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:15,134
which is 1990, is $472 million.

172
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:19,980
The volatility of the underlying asset is 35% per year.

173
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,170
And the risk free rate is 9%.

174
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,830
From the Black-Scholes formula, the value of this call

175
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,995
is $54 million.

176
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:34,740
We will return to this calculation in a second.

177
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,320


178
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,110
Factoring in the option value of model B,

179
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,000
we now can assess the total value of model A.

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,160
The table on the slide summarizes the results.

181
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,360
The second row gives the NPV from a naive discounted cash

182
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,430
role calculation.

183
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,760
Model A itself gives minus $42 million.

184
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,150
And A plus B is minus 42 minus $84 million,

185
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,070
discounted back three years at 20%.

186
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,870
This gives us a total of minus $91 million.

187
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,290
This is clearly a no go.

188
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,790
However, when we realize that model B is an option,

189
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,040
the picture is different.

190
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,320
This is given by the second column in the table.

191
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,600
The NPV on model A is still minus 42 million,

192
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,750
while the model B really gives an option

193
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,916
value, which has a positive amount of $54 million.

194
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:48,830
The sum, then, is $12 million positive,

195
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,480
given in the last row of the second column.

196
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,350
Therefore, we conclude the following.

197
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,350
Model A, by itself, is a loser.

198
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,400
But it also gives MC Inc. the option, but not

199
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,650
the obligation to launch model B, which has a positive value.

200
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,120
Given the high uncertainty about the future value of model B

201
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,620
as shown above, this option is quite valuable.

202
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,350
Adding the two values together, we actually

203
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,050
obtained a positive value for launching

204
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,900
model A. One thing we want to add

205
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,720
is that the scale of this project,

206
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,070
namely launching model A, and thus getting into the PC

207
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,130
business, is fairly large, hundreds

208
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,260
of millions of dollars.

209
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,310
Model A alone requires initial investment of $450 million.

210
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,540
The resulting NPV, even including

211
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,855
the option value of model B, is quite small, only $12 million.

212
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:56,650
If we vary the assumptions a bit,

213
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,540
such as cash flow forecasts and volatility estimates,

214
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,030
the result can easily become negative.

215
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,700
MC Inc. finally decided not to launch model A.

216
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,250
Before we finish this example, let's

217
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,160
take a look at the details of the option

218
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,020
valuation for model B using the Black-Scholes formula.

219
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,978
All value numbers are in million dollars.

220
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:27,510
The value of the underlying asset A,

221
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:33,880
which is the future profit of model B, is now worth $472.

222
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,330
The strike price K is $900 for the call

223
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,490
option on the underlying asset.

224
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,530
The call is European.

225
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,670
And it's maturity T is three years.

226
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:52,880
The volatility of the underlying asset, sigma, is 35% per year.

227
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,440
The interest rate, RF, is 9% per year.

228
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,760
The value of x, a key input to the Black-Scholes formula,

229
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,140
is given by the first equation on this slide, which

230
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,220
depends on the current asset value A, strike price

231
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:17,120
K, interest rate RF, volatility sigma, and maturity T.

232
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,980
Put in the corresponding numbers,

233
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,890
we have x equals minus 0.3351.

234
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,340
It's close to 0, but slightly negative.

235
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,880
Putting the value of x into the Black-Scholes formula,

236
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,820
we have the second equation on the slide, which

237
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,980
gives the value of the call option C. It is $54 million,

238
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,550
as stated before.
