00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,800
PROFESSOR: In this section, we compare CAPM to the APT model

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,530
and discuss their similarities and differences.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,460
The CAPM pricing equation is a mathematical

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,150
equivalent to the single factor APT model,

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,660
where the market portfolio is the only systematic risk

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,200
factor.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,720
This begs the question, how exactly

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,150
does CAPM relate to APT?

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,060
What are the similarities and differences between these two

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,970
fundamental theories?

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,330
Starting with the differences between the two models,

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,630
CAPM and APT are derived from very different assumptions.

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,520
CAPM places strong restrictions on investor preferences.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,340
We have to assume that all investors are

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,860
mean variance optimizers.

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,670
In comparison, APT only requires that investors

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,750
prefer more to less.

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,700
In other words, there is no arbitrage in the market.

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,430


20
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,920
APT requires that asset returns obey a factor structure.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,700
CAPM does not assume any effective structure in returns.

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,150
Another point of difference is that CAPM pricing

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,610
applies to all assets.

24
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,880
In contrast, the APT pricing equation

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,270
holds exactly only for the well-diversified portfolios.

26
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,320
For all other assets, it holds only approximately.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,660
A relatively small number of assets

28
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,470
may violate the APT equation without creating arbitrage

29
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,560
in the market.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,100
Under CAPM, market return is the only systematic risk

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,090
we need to consider.

32
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,810
CAPM is specific about the identity of the risk factor.

33
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,680
APT potentially allows for multiple risk factors,

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
but does not tell us what these factors are.

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,260
With these considerations in mind,

36
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,380
can we reconcile CAPM and APT?

37
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,220
Specifically, if we assume that stock returns are

38
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,360
driven by multiple systematic factors, could CAPM still hold?

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,400
The answer is yes.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,620
There is no contradiction here.

41
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,340
The CAPM relation would still hold

42
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,480
under the CAPM assumptions.

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,360
In which case, the market factor would

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,095
price all of the APT factors according to the CAPM formula.

45
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:30,850


46
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,360
Ultimately, the two models, CAPM and APT,

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,300
share the same fundamental insight.

48
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,640
That only systematic risk is compensated in the market.

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,810
Idiosyncratic risk does not carry a risk premium.

50
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,360
This is a far reaching conclusion,

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,890
which holds under many other asset pricing models.

52
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,210
Let us reiterate the intuition for the CAPM result.

53
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,240
Optimizing investors choose to hold the market

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,140
portfolio, which provides the best possible risk return

55
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,070
trade-off.

56
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,280
Idiosyncratic risk of an individual stock

57
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,730
ends up diversified within the market portfolio.

58
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,060
And therefore, it does not affect the expected return

59
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,080
on the stock in equilibrium.
