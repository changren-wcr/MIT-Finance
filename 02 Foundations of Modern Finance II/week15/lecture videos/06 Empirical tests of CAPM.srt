PROFESSOR: In this segment, we discuss how well the CAPM

1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,310
model works in the data.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,230
We'll look at the most common empirical tests of the CAPM.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,520
Our goal is to establish how well market betas of firms

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,790
explain differences in their average stock returns.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,060
In the first test, we form portfolios of firms

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,700
with different market betas.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,300
There are two reasons for grouping firms into portfolios.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,930
First, firm-level betas may change over time.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,550
Sorting firms into portfolios based on their estimated betas

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,240
allows us to construct assets or portfolios

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,090
with relatively stable betas, which simplifies the test.

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,680
Second, firm-level betas are estimated with noise.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,740
Grouping stocks into portfolios reduces

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,660
the effect of noise in a simple and intuitive manner.

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,620
Let's look closely at the test design.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,800
We follow the well-known 1972 paper

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,350
by Black, Jensen, and Scholes.

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,470
Each month, we compute the excess return

19
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,010
on each stock as the difference between its return

20
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,650
from the start to the end of the month

21
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,860
and the risk-free interest rate, which we measure

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,620
as the one-month T-Bill rate.

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,420
Then, for each security, we use the most recent 60 months

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,550
of returns to estimate its market beta.

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,810
For that, we run the OLS regression of excess returns

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,660
on the stock on the excess market returns.

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,720
Finally, at the start of each year,

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,810
we sort firms into portfolios based

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,950
on their recent beta estimates as of the end of December

30
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,090
of the previous year.

31
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,070


32
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,420
For each portfolio, we compute its excess return each month.

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,150
We use valuated portfolio returns.

34
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,750
Note that we construct portfolio returns only

35
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,389
after the portfolio formation.

36
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,870
For example, if we are creating portfolios

37
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,250
by sorting on beta estimates at the end of year 2005,

38
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,430
we then compute monthly portfolio returns

39
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,740
during year 2006 and so on.

40
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,880
Once we have constructed the time series of portfolio excess

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,550
returns, we compute the market betas

42
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,090
for each portfolio using a full-sample regression

43
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,710
of portfolio excess returns on the market excess returns.

44
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,380
We also compute the time-series average

45
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:49,590
of excess monthly returns on each of the 10 portfolios.

46
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,260
To visualize the risk-return tradeoff across the 10

47
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,430
portfolios, we plot their average returns

48
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,830
against their market betas.

49
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:05,800
As we see from the graph, over 1931 to 2019 period,

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,340
there is a positive relation between the market beta

51
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,400
and expected excess returns, which

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,720
is consistent with the CAPM prediction.

53
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,500
However, this positive relation is not as strong

54
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,660
as the CAPM predicts.

55
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,650
The slope of the security market line is approximately 3.5%.

56
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,410
According to the CAPM, the slope should

57
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,450
be equal to the market risk premium

58
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,770
during this period, which is roughly twice as large.

59
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,140
If we limit our analysis to the later part

60
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,300
of the sample starting in 1963, the security market line

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,880
is even more flat.

62
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,230
This plot also implies that the expected excess return

63
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,180
on the assets with zero market betas is much higher than 0,

64
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,010
as the CAPM would imply.

65
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,980
It is roughly 6% per year.

66
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,170
Other examples of CAPM violations

67
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,320
can be constructed by sorting stocks on certain firm

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,520
characteristics, such as firm size or the market

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,520
to book ratio of its equity.

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,230
In the well-known 1992 paper, Fama and French show that small

71
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,490
stocks and stocks with high market to book ratios called

72
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,320
value stocks tend to outperform, and their relatively high

73
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,240
average returns cannot be properly explained by the CAPM.

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,610
There are two main competing interpretations

75
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,730
of the empirical evidence on the failures of CAPM.

76
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,570
One possible conclusion is that small stocks,

77
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,680
high book to market stocks, low beta stocks, and so forth

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,410
are mispriced by the market, and our analysis

79
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,330
reveals the true alpha--

80
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,250
abnormal risk-adjusted returns.

81
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,920
One should be careful and not jump to this conclusion

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,330
too soon.

83
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,540
If true, this type of mispricing is quite easy to find.

84
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,260
It is then puzzling that it does not get arbitraged away

85
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,950
by the professional asset managers, who collectively

86
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,670
struggle to outperform passive investment benchmarks,

87
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:22,720
such as the valuated stock market index or S&P 500.

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,320
Perhaps it is difficult to take advantage of such mispricing

89
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,100
because of market frictions, such as, for instance,

90
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,455
relatively low liquidity of small stocks.

91
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:34,990


92
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,580
Another interpretation is that CAPM is not complete

93
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,510
and it misses important risk factors.

94
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,885
Such missing factors would then manifest themselves

95
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:47,680
as CAPM alphas.

96
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,460


97
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,010
Which interpretation is right is still

98
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,850
an open question and the subject of an extensive and growing

99
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,990
literature.

100
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,930
It is difficult to argue that CAPM alphas can

101
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,650
be fully explained by the missing risk factors.

102
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,180
It is likely that market frictions also play a role.

103
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,150
However, existing evidence strongly

104
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,450
suggests that the stock market return is not

105
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,190
the only risk factor compensated with the risk premium.

106
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,640
This means that multifactor extensions

107
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,380
may offer an improvement over the single-factor CAPM model.

108
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,170
Such extensions can be developed under the APT framework.
