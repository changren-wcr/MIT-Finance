00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,680
PROFESSOR: In this segment, we'll

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,230
consider how CAPM is used in capital budgeting.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,660
We rely on a survey of 392 chief financial officers published

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,970
in 2001 by John Graham and Cam Harvey.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,150
One of the questions they asked in the survey

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,610
was about the valuation techniques

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,020
these CFOs use for capital budgeting decisions.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,220
In particular, the question was about estimation

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,950
of the cost of capital.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,730
As we can see from the graph summarizing the responses,

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,570
CAPM is by far the most commonly used model.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,690
Over 70% of the managers use CAPM.

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,810
Managers typically apply multiple models,

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,360
and we can see that the sum across the answers

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,640
is over 100%.

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,570
The second common approach is the arithmetic average

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,020
historical return, and close to that is the multi-beta

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,540
CAPM, which is another name for the APT.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,260


20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,420
The choice of the pricing methodology

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,640
differs systematical across firms.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,170
Large firms, public firms, low leverage firms

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,850
are more likely to use CAPM.

24
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,660
When it comes to the multifactor extensions of the CAPM,

25
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,180
the most common additional factors

26
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,980
tend to target foreign exchange rates, interest rates, GDP

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,630
risk, and inflation risk.

28
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,350
Large firms tend to focus on the foreign exchange risk

29
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,890
factors, which is intuitive, as these firms are more

30
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,790
likely to have global operations with cash flows exposed

31
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,790
to exchange rate fluctuations.

32
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,550
Small firms tend to favor interest rate

33
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,710
risk in their models.

34
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,580
As we see from the survey, CAPM is the leading model

35
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,550
of the cost of capital despite its empirical limitations.

36
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,630
There could be several reasons for this.

37
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,100
In capital budgeting, firms value projects.

38
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,610
In this context, one needs to forecast discount rates

39
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,530
over long horizons.

40
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,470
Most of the empirical valuations of CAPM

41
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,870
come from applying the model to rebalanced equity portfolios.

42
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,040
Firms tend to move relatively quickly across such portfolios,

43
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,660
which means that the CAPM alphas one finds for a given firm tend

44
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,280
to be transient.

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,180
They tend to apply over a short period, a few quarters, or even

46
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,850
a few months after portfolio construction

47
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,600
and do not extend into the future.

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,480
Quantitatively, such violations are

49
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,440
relatively minor when it comes to long horizon forecasts

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,630
of the discount rates.

51
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,580
This is not to say that CAPM works perfectly.

52
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,260
But we need to evaluate pros and cons of alternative models

53
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,900
with a particular set of applications in mind.

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,440
To quote George Box, a famous statistician,

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,120
all models are wrong, but some are useful.

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,000
