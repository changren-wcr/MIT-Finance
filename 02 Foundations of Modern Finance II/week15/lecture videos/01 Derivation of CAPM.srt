00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:01,590
PROFESSOR: This week, we introduce

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,990
one of the fundamental models in finance.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,740
The capital asset pricing model, or in short, CAPM.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,270
CAPM connects expected returns on various assets

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,090
to their risk.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,270
CAPM tells us that the right measure of risk

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,730
is the covariance of asset return

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,250
with the so-called market portfolio.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,710
We start with the derivation of the CAPM,

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,590
and then discuss its intuition.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,190
Unlike the arbitrage pricing theory, which also delays

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,400
expected returns to risk, CAPM is an equilibrium model,

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,140
which emphasizes the balance between supply and demand

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,620
for financial assets.

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,340
The logic of CAPM is fundamental and far reaching,

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,340
and this model is one of the leading examples of equilibrium

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,140
thinking in finance.

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,030
We then discuss practical aspects

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,840
of applying the CAPM model, relevant empirical evidence,

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,540
and limitations of the model.

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,810
To derive the CAPM, we need to model investors' demand

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,879
for financial assets.

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,450
To do that, we built on the mean variance portfolio theory.

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,880
Under the mean various preferences,

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,090
investors diversify non systematic risk,

26
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,270
and end up holding only the risk free asset

27
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,820
and the specific portfolio of stocks--

28
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,710
the tangency portfolio.

29
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,890
We now ask, what does the combined demand

30
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,140
of all investors look like?

31
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,120
And how does this demand determine

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,780
the relation between risk and return on financial assets?

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,560
Before we dive into the derivation of the CAPM,

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,590
we need to introduce the notion of the market portfolio.

35
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,730
The market portfolio is a portfolio of all risky assets

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,980
traded in the market.

37
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,990
We will need some notation.

38
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,230
Suppose that there is a total of n risky assets traded

39
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,520
in the market.

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,730
We call these assets stocks.

41
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,370
Market capitalization, or in short,

42
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,700
market cap of each stock, is equal to its price

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,289
per share times the number of outstanding shares.

44
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,750
The total market cap of all stocks

45
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,260
is the sum of all the individual market caps.

46
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,774
This is the value, or the price, of the market portfolio.

47
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,560
Portfolio weights in the market portfolio

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,940
are then, given by the ratio of the market cap of each stock,

49
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,460
to the total value of the market portfolio.

50
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:38,290
We denote the vector of market portfolio weights by w sub m.

51
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,710
CAPM relies on a set of important assumptions

52
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,700
about the financial market and investors.

53
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,240
We begin by assuming that all investors invest

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,090
over a single period, t0 to t1.

55
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,870
They buy a portfolio of financial assets at time 0

56
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,010
and liquidate that portfolio at time one.

57
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,940
We also assume that the only source of wealth investors

58
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,230
have is their portfolio of financial assets.

59
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,250
They have no other sources of income.

60
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,780
This means that investors' preferences are defined

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,980
over the return on their portfolios between times 0

62
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,720
and time 1.

63
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,380
We assume that our investors have correct expectations,

64
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,790
meaning that they know the true distribution of asset returns.

65
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,160
This is also an important assumption.

66
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,440
It means that investors in the model

67
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,260
do not disagree with each other.

68
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,710
We assume that all investors have mean variance preferences.

69
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,650
They may have different levels of risk aversion,

70
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,780
but it is important that they only

71
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,570
care about the first two moments of returns on their portfolios.

72
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,020
Next, we assume that there exists a risk free asset

73
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,750
in the market.

74
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,770
We further assume that this asset is in 0 net supply.

75
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,300
This means that some investors may lend, others may borrow,

76
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,960
but their combined position in the risk free asset is 0.

77
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,330
For every dollar an investor borrows,

78
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,190
there must be another investor who is lending that dollar.

79
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,029
This assumption is not critical and could be relaxed.

80
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,840
For example, if we instead assume that the risk free asset

81
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,110
is in positive net supply, all we have to do

82
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,040
is include the risk free asset into the market portfolio.

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,440
As an aside, we may want to allow

84
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,510
for the net position in the risk free asset

85
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,870
to be positive, in order to model the fact that investors

86
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,820
can hold treasuries.

87
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,940
Note, however, that in the case of treasuries,

88
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,920
each dollar investors lend is $1 borrowed by the government.

89
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,010
If the government repays these loans from the revenue

90
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,230
it raises from taxes on the same investors,

91
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,620
and if you consider the tax liability

92
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,290
as a part of each investor's portfolio,

93
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,210
it is no longer obvious that there

94
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,160
is a positive net supply of the risk free asset in the market.

95
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,500
This line of reasoning quickly gets

96
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,280
into some fairly deep issues related to fiscal policy.

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,000
In the context of CAPM, we sidestep such issues,

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,050
and simply assume that the net supply of the risk free asset

99
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,340
is 0.

100
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,450
In this model, investors are not limited by constraints,

101
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,900
and can trade with no transaction costs.

102
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,750
In other words, the financial market is frictionless.

103
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,920
Finally, we state the market clearing condition.

104
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,590
Total demand for financial assets

105
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,120
must be equal to their total supply.

106
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,700
This means that each outstanding stock

107
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,750
share is held by some investor.

108
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,050
CAPM is what is called an equilibrium model.

109
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,620
Equilibrium models have two important elements--

110
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,490
first, they make assumptions about investors' behavior,

111
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,660
as we do here.

112
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,980
We assume mean variance preferences.

113
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,590
Second, these models impose the market clearing condition.

114
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:20,800
In equilibrium, prices must be such that supply equals demand.

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,020
As we combine the two elements, we

116
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,080
can begin to understand how individual investor

117
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,560
behavior affects prices in the financial markets.

118
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,700
CAPM is an important example of using equilibrium analysis

119
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,040
for pricing financial assets.

120
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,820
Note as a related observation that our analysis

121
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,660
of relative pricing, using the no arbitrage principle,

122
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,960
follows from equilibrium analysis.

123
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,410
As long as investors prefer more to less,

124
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,310
and are not constrained, arbitrage opportunities cannot

125
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,640
exist in equilibrium.

126
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,510
That means that in equilibrium, all the results derived

127
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,340
by pure arbitrage arguments must also hold.

128
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,170
Recall that under the assumptions

129
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,070
of mean various preferences and no constraints,

130
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,640
every investor puts their money into two pots--

131
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,940
the riskless asset, and a particular portfolio

132
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,170
of risky assets, which we call the tangency portfolio.

133
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,810
Note that here, we are also using the assumption

134
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,490
that investors know the true distribution of asset returns.

135
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,050
Because all investors hold the same risky portfolio,

136
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,100
or the tangency portfolio, they must hold stocks

137
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,700
in the same proportions.

138
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,390
Let's aggregate all the stock positions across the investors.

139
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,170
Collectively, they hold stocks in the same proportions

140
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,060
as in the tangency portfolio.

141
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,650
We will now impose the market clearing condition.

142
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,070
The total supply of all stocks in the market

143
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,750
is the market portfolio.

144
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,870
Investors demand the tangency portfolio.

145
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,410
Market clearing then implies that the tangency portfolio

146
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,420
and the market portfolio must be the same.

147
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,640
In other words, we conclude that the market portfolio must

148
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,890
be on the capital market line.

149
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,350
It is mean variance efficient.

150
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,740
We now illustrate the critical step in our argument.

151
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,740
The total asset holdings of all investors

152
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,100
must equal the total supply of these assets.

153
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,460
Consider a market with three stocks, a, b, and c.

154
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,460
Suppose that the composition of the tangency portfolio

155
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,900
is the following--

156
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:55,130
25% in stock a, 50% in stock b, and 25% in stock c.

157
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,800
There are only three investors in this economy.

158
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,000
We will label them as one, two, and three.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,950
The total wealth of these investors

160
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:10,800
is $500, $1,000, and $1,500, respectively.

161
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,290
We summarize asset holdings of each investor

162
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,490
in the following table.

163
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,990
We can see how much they invest in the risk free asset,

164
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,460
and in each of the stocks.

165
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,470
For example investor one splits her investments

166
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,290
between the risk free asset and the tangency portfolio.

167
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,620
She holds $100 in the safe asset and $400

168
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,720
in the tangency portfolio.

169
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,300
Which means $100 in stock a, $200 in stock b,

170
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,000
and $100 in stock c.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,580
Investor three borrows at the risk free rate.

172
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,570
So the risk free position of this investor is negative.

173
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,050
The risky position is also the tangency portfolio,

174
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,150
with a total of $1,800 invested into the stocks.

175
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,560
Know that this investor starts with $1,500 in total wealth,

176
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,700
and borrows $300 more at the risk free rate, which

177
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:19,390
brings the total value invested in stocks to $1,800.

178
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,470
Collectively, investors do not hold the safe asset.

179
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,920
We can see that their individual holdings in the risk free asset

180
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,270
sum up to zero.

181
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,540
Their combined holdings of the stocks

182
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:42,120
are $750 in stock a, $1,500 in stock b, And $750 in stock c.

183
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,410
In equilibrium, the total dollar holding of each asset

184
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,500
must equal its market value, because all

185
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,070
the outstanding shares of stocks are held by the investors.

186
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,880
We then conclude that the market cap of stock a is $750,

187
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:07,350
it is $1,500 for stock b, and $750 for stock c.

188
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,690
The total market cap of the market portfolio

189
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,310
is 3,000, which is the sum of the market caps of stocks

190
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,150
a, b, and c.

191
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,430
We then compute the weights of the three stocks

192
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,980
in the market portfolio, and confirm

193
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,660
that they are the same as the weights

194
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,550
in the tangency portfolio.

195
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:34,260
Namely, 0.25 for a, 0.5 for b, and 0.25 for c.

196
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,790
We are now ready to establish the CAPM formula.

197
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,410
We have done all the heavy lifting

198
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,320
in the context of mean variance portfolio choice.

199
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,930
Now we apply our prior results.

200
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,180
Recall that the marginal contribution

201
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,020
of an asset to the expected excess return of the market

202
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,440
portfolio is given by its own expected excess return.

203
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,830
The marginal contribution of an asset to the risk of the market

204
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,370
portfolio is given by the covariance of the asset

205
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,300
with the market, divided by the standard deviation of market

206
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,070
returns.

207
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,180
Because the market portfolio is the tangency portfolio,

208
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,690
the marginal return to risk ratio for each asset

209
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,530
must be the same, and equal to the Sharpe ratio of the market

210
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,940
portfolio.

211
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,620
This is the CAPM result. We now rewrite the CAPM result

212
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,860
with the risk premium on the left hand side.

213
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,370
The risk premium of a stock is equal to the market risk

214
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,490
premium times the beta of the stock,

215
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,520
with respect to the market portfolio.

216
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,890
The market beta is the ratio of the covariance of assets return

217
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,670
with the market portfolio, normalized by the market return

218
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,080
variance.

219
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,340
Stock's beta summarizes its systematic risk.

220
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,580
It's the exposure of the stock to the market return.

221
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,730
CAPM tells us that the beta of the stock,

222
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,400
with respect to the market, is the right measure

223
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,770
of systematic risk.

224
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,470
Mathematically, the market beta is

225
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,760
equivalent to a factor loading in the ABT framework,

226
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,730
where the only risk factor is the market return.

227
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,080
The market risk premium is the price of systematic risk.

228
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,870
It's the amount of compensation a stock

229
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,600
delivers to the investors per unit of systematic risk.

230
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,510
The risk premium of any stock is a product

231
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,840
of the quantity of systematic risk, or its market

232
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,810
data, and the price of risk, which

233
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,350
is the market risk premium.

234
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,000
