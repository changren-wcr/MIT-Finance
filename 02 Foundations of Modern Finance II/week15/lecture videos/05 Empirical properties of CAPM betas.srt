PROFESSOR: In this segment, we look

1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,460
at the empirical properties of market betas

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,100
and discuss how stock betas are related

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,750
to the economic fundamentals of firms.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,890
The table here contains estimates of market betas

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,400
for a number of stocks.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,160
These estimates are based on daily data

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,620
over a six-month period.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,820
Note that all the beta estimates here are positive.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,790
All the stocks in this table covary positively

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,780
with the stock market portfolio.

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,610
This is typical for the majority of stocks.

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,920
These estimates fall into range between 0.3 and 1.7.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,960
This also applies to the majority

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,040
of stocks in the market.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,250
Note also that the average beta in the table

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,060
appears to be close to 1.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,590
This is intuitive because the beta of any portfolio

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,800
is a weighted average of individual betas,

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,450
and the beta of the market portfolio is 1.

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,650
This means that the weighted average beta of all the stocks

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,620
in the market portfolio is 1.

22
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,570
Finally, consider the total volatility of stock returns

23
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:23,050
relative to the stock-specific or idiosyncratic volatility.

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,030
The difference between these two is

25
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,290
the market-wide systematic risk, which is proportional

26
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,720
to the stock's beta.

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,350
For many stocks, most of their daily variation

28
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,490
is due to firm-specific shocks.

29
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,390
Market risk explains a relatively small portion

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,680
of their total return variance.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
These numbers highlight that total return volatility

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,370
of a stock is a poor proxy for its risk premium.

33
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,340
Most of the return variance of individual stocks

34
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,090
is idiosyncratic and gets diversified

35
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,820
when we combine stocks into a diversified portfolio,

36
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,730
such as the market portfolio.

37
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:13,060
Next, we consider market betas of various industries estimated

38
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,390
with monthly data over a five-year period.

39
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,750
We see approximately the same range of values

40
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,210
as for the stocks in our previous table.

41
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,180
We can also ask why industry betas differ from each other.

42
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,000
Do these numbers reflect some important differences

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,920
in economic fundamentals?

44
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,420
One pattern we can see is that some of the lowest betas

45
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,330
correspond to the relatively stable industries,

46
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,530
such as utilities and consumer staples.

47
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,950
Some of the highest values come from the more cyclical

48
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,060
sectors--

49
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,520
energy or chemicals.

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,540
In other words, industry cyclicality matters.

51
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,970
Industries with the more cyclical demand

52
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,090
for their output tend to have more cyclical cash

53
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,080
flows, which contributes to their higher market betas.

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,570
Other aggregate shocks may be important here as well.

55
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,860
For example, industries differ in their reliance

56
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,850
on credit markets, which also contributes to their cash flow

57
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,420
risk.

58
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,400
Finally, it is important to keep in mind that we are looking

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,470
at the market betas of stocks.

60
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,590
There is a difference between the value of the firm's stock

61
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,750
and the overall firm value.

62
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,060
Stocks represent just one type of corporate claims.

63
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,060
As a result, properties of a stock

64
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,960
depend not only on the economic fundamentals of the firm,

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,600
but also on its capital structure,

66
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,440
specifically on how much debt the firm has

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,120
relative to its equity value.

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,920
The more debt the firm has relative to its equity, or put

69
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,950
differently, the more leverage the firm has,

70
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,650
the higher its equity beta relative to its asset beta.

71
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,330
So all else equal, firms using more leverage

72
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,480
should have higher equity betas.

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,540
What complicates this picture is that leverage level

74
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,510
is at least partly a choice.

75
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,050
Firms decide how much debt to issue,

76
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,960
and firms with more stable cash flows

77
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,950
tend to use more debt in their capital structure.

78
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,300
This means that firms using more leverage

79
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,700
tend to have lower enterprise betas or asset betas.

80
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,860
The bottom line is that the relation

81
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,150
between the level of leverage and equity betas across firms

82
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,730
is far from straightforward.

83
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,360
Consider an example of how equity beta relates

84
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,600
to the enterprise beta of a firm.

85
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,080
Suppose that firm ABC is financed

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,910
by a mix of debt and equity, and its debt to equity ratio

87
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,010
is 0.65.

88
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,780
Debt of ABC is relatively safe, and its market beta is low--

89
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,340
0.1.

90
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,530
Assume that the market beta of ABC stock is 0.73.

91
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,380
What can we say about the enterprise-level market

92
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,550
beta of ABC, or in other words, the beta of its assets?

93
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,790
Because ABC has only debt and equity in its capital

94
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,090
structure, together, its debt and equity

95
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,800
represent the claim on all of its assets.

96
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,930
We conclude that the combined market

97
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:48,070
value of ABC's debt and equity equals its enterprise value.

98
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,840
The enterprise is a portfolio of firm's debt and equity.

99
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,840
The beta of a portfolio is a weighted average

100
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,270
of the betas of individual positions.

101
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,880
Using this observation, we can compute

102
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,910
the enterprise beta of ABC.

103
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,410
It is the beta of its equity, 0.73,

104
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,990
times the weight of equity in its capital structure,

105
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:21,460
which is 1 over 165, plus the debt beta, 0.1,

106
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:29,330
times the weight of debt, which is 0.65 over 1.65.

107
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:35,710
We find that the enterprise beta is equal to 0.48.

108
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,010
Note that the equity beta is higher than the enterprise

109
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,170
beta of ABC.

110
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,050
This is due to the effect of leverage

111
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,500
created by the firm's debt.

112
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,000
