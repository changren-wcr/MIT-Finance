PROFESSOR: In this segment, we'll

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,470
go into the details of the argument we discussed

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,100
during the recent webinar.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,830
This is an idea due to Fischer Black, who

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,220
suggested that if some investors in the market

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,219
prefer high beta stocks to low beta stocks,

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,160
this results in a violation of the CAPM,

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,380
where the security market line is relatively flat.

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,050
Firms can take advantage of this violation

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,230
and increase their market value by levering up.

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,230
The result is that even though the CAPM fails

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,270
to hold in the capital market, it

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,710
is still very useful for corporate financial decisions.

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,900
This argument provides an interesting connection

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,660
between the CAPM and the M&M theorem

16
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,660
that we discussed later in the course.

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,650
Eventually this brought us back to the APT.

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,240
And for full details, I will refer you to the webinar video.
