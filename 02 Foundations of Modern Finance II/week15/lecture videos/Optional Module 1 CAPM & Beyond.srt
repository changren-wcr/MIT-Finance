1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,320
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,620
Welcome to our webinar.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,990
I wanted to use this opportunity to discuss

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,040
some of the issues related to CAPM, and some of the ideas

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,290
that maybe go a little beyond the scope of the course,

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,440
and also to respond to some of your questions.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,120
I had a few things in mind when we started playing the webinar.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,280
But then we got a bunch of very good questions.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,650
So at the end, we decided to go through the questions

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,020
other than some of the prepared material.

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,810
Although, that's still coming at the end of this hour.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,040
And what I did is I basically copied some of the questions

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,810
and merged them with some light editing.

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,383
Because a few of you were asking about similar things.

15
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:45,800
So what you're going to see is not

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,710
literally copy/paste, but an edited version

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,960
of the questions.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,470
So with that said, let me get started.

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,270
We'll jump right into it.

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,880


21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:08,670
OK, so let's begin with the issues of CAPM implementation.

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,910
So the first set of questions was about the choice

23
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,280
of the benchmark.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,030
What are the implications of the benchmark

25
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,030
used as the market portfolio to implement CAPM?

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,750
For example, a multi-asset benchmark,

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,530
or is the geographic focus in the benchmark?

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,340
So this is a very good question.

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,990
Logically speaking, when we think

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,180
about what the market portfolio is,

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,630
that's the portfolio held by the investors.

32
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,010
And there is no reason to limit it to just equities.

33
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,810
Equities are a part of the portfolio.

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,650
But that's not the whole.

35
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,100
And it's not even the largest part.

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,310
There are other asset classes there.

37
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,070
We have obviously fixed income securities, bonds.

38
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,040
We have real estate.

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,950
Some people would argue even human capital.

40
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,540
And when you add all of that up, it's

41
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,850
a lot larger than the stock market.

42
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,440
Now, there has been some academic work exploring

43
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,000
these alternative benchmarks.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,610
And there does seem to be some additional information coming

45
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,390
from other asset classes.

46
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,810
But at the end of the day, there are some practical issues

47
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,790
that we have to contend with, which

48
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,700
is that data coming from equity markets

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,010
is available at high frequency.

50
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,290
It's precisely measured.

51
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,680
Prices are precisely measured.

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,740
And so we can estimate betas.

53
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,350
It's very important to have the right alignment of timing

54
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,730
when you estimate betas.

55
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,660
So for that reason, the equity markets, of course,

56
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,550
are very convenient to use.

57
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,710
And they do capture a lot of information

58
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,320
about what happens in the investor's portfolio more

59
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,130
broadly, even though it may be a small fraction in terms

60
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,180
of the dollar value.

61
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,400
But then in other asset classes, if you

62
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,520
think about corporate bonds, or real estate, or even

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,070
human capital, the less liquid they are,

64
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,325
the harder they are to use.

65
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,450
And in particular, when you want to estimate betas,

66
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,660
it's actually pretty tricky when your portfolio

67
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,070
includes illiquid securities.

68
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,260
Because you don't measure the value very well.

69
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,240
You certainly cannot measure precisely at high frequency.

70
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,480
So for that reason, these efforts,

71
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,060
they couldn't gain a lot of traction.

72
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,490
And so now in practice people use equity portfolios.

73
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,070
But I would say that with the advent of ETFs,

74
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,170
we have more and more information

75
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,870
about market valuation of those less liquid assets.

76
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,440
And so there may be some updates to that,

77
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,650
so that going forward you may see

78
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,260
more acceptance of using other asset classes

79
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,080
as a part of the benchmark.

80
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,540
Now, the second set of questions is

81
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,920
about estimation of parameters.

82
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,770
So how do we estimate the parameters?

83
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,300
What do we do about various issues,

84
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,190
for example, risk-free rate?

85
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,400
Do we use historical rates, or spot rates?

86
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,380
What do we do about maturities?

87
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,380
What about the market risk premiums, same thing,

88
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,890
use historical or implicit market risk premium?

89
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,590
And then there was a question about possible approaches

90
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,370
to increase the accuracy of the market risk premium.

91
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,820
Basically, you have a lot of volatility going back,

92
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,010
including volatile interest rates.

93
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,300
So they use historical returns that are backward looking.

94
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,320
What do you do?

95
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,280
So now, let's unpack that.

96
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,750
Interest rates, obviously, vary across maturities.

97
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,980
Short rate and long rates are different.

98
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,290
So which ones do we use?

99
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,350
What do we do about it, historical or spot?

100
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,310
Let's think about the underlying principles.

101
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,100
CAPM is supposed to give us a relation

102
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,010
between expected returns going forward

103
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,110
and some measures of risk.

104
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,670
So inputs, like interest rates or a market risk premium,

105
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,940
ideally we want forward looking inputs.

106
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,180
We want to have a number that represents the interest

107
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,850
rate going forward or the expected market

108
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,858
return going forward.

109
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,650
Now, in case of interest rates, we actually

110
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,350
have market information we can use.

111
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,590
So that's pretty convenient.

112
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,100
So we can use spot rates.

113
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,670
So there I would say the answer is

114
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,870
as you are estimating the cost of capital, for example,

115
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,680
you plug in the current interest rates, the spot rates.

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,400
Historical rates are useful as a part of estimation

117
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
of the market risk premium.

118
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,660
When you go back and look at the historical data,

119
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,600
you compare market returns to the spot rates

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,720
in the past that are matched with the market

121
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,560
returns in time.

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,330
And you'll take the difference.

123
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,860
That's your excess return.

124
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,660
And you estimate the average excess return.

125
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,420
So that could be your estimate of the risk premium.

126
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,840
But when you apply the CAPM, when

127
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,630
you use it to project expected returns going forward,

128
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,340
you use the spot rate.

129
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,245
Now, what about maturities?

130
00:05:58,245 --> 00:05:59,820
That gets kind of interesting.

131
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,980
It depends on the context, depends on the application.

132
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,880
CAPM is a static model.

133
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,400
It's describing the market over a single period.

134
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,070
The market that we operate in is not static.

135
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,820
It's dynamic.

136
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,522
It has multiple periods.

137
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:16,230
So that's one of the limitations of CAPM.

138
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,890
We're going to come back to that.

139
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,720
What do we do about it?

140
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,617
Well, essentially, it's a handicap of the model.

141
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,450
It's a static model.

142
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,240
And you have to somehow apply it.

143
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,345
So you need some additional maybe ad hoc steps.

144
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:32,730
You need some additional decisions.

145
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,675
And they, of course, are context specific.

146
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:36,175
So for example, if you're using CAPM

147
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:38,190
to evaluate portfolio managers.

148
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,800
You're trying to understand, are they able to beat the market?

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,960
Are they generating an alpha?

150
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,130
Or if you are using a CAPM for short horizon event studies,

151
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,080
where you are talking about events

152
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,320
that unravel on a scale of days or weeks,

153
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,100
then it makes a lot of sense to use a short term interest rate.

154
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,450
And that's going to correspond to the horizon over which

155
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,660
you're evaluating various investment strategies or market

156
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,130
events.

157
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,332
When you're using CAPM for capital budgeting,

158
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:08,040
that's different.

159
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,220
Because very often, these real investment projects

160
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,320
have longer horizons.

161
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,480
It could be that the half life of these cash flows

162
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,780
is five or 10 years.

163
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,840
So in that case, it's very common

164
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,870
to use long term interest rates as the risk free rate.

165
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,540
It's as if when you're applying CAPM

166
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,140
you're saying that my time period, CAPM, is

167
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,210
silent about what that is physically.

168
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,820
But let's say my time period is five years.

169
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,720
It's not one month.

170
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,560
It's five years.

171
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,640
So then you're going to plug in say a five-year interest rate,

172
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,740
spot rate.

173
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,530
All right, what about the market risk premium?

174
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,030
Well, that turns out to be also kind of tricky, right?

175
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,420
We can, of course, measure the historical risk premium.

176
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,020
But is that a good estimate of the expected excess market

177
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,960
return going forward?

178
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
Well, there are reasons to believe that it might not

179
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,385
be, it may be biased.

180
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:03,510
We have lived through an unusual period of history.

181
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,850
And one could argue that the US economy was kind of lucky

182
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,760
and had a very good run, and that going forward,

183
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,910
average returns may be lower, the risk premium may be lower.

184
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,620
Perhaps there is that argument.

185
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,670
Also, the environment has changed.

186
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,680
It is much easier to diversify now than it used to be.

187
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,420
Transaction costs are lower.

188
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,610
So all of these frictions are now lower.

189
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,180
And that also affects the measured risk premium

190
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,360
in the market.

191
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,770
So for that reason, there are good arguments

192
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,520
for using the implied risk premium, the implicit market

193
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,669
risk premium.

194
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,300
We have seen in Fin one how to do that, right?

195
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,150
You have to start with some kind of pricing model,

196
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,830
like the Gordon Growth Model.

197
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,750
And then you plug in estimates of growth rates of cash flows

198
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,750
and dividends.

199
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,810
And you back out the implied value

200
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,190
of the market expected return.

201
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,640
You compare it to interest rates.

202
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,270
You could get a risk premium.

203
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,850
So that is a possibility.

204
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,030
And if you look at the actual applications of CAPM,

205
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,040
people use both.

206
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,580
It's good to have a few different angles of attack

207
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,940
and compare the results.

208
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,790
So using implied risk premium makes a lot of sense.

209
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,380
And I would certainly try that myself.

210
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,360
Because just looking at the realized average

211
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,540
historical return is not the best way

212
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,720
to estimate expected returns going forward.

213
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,210
It's very much one path of history.

214
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,500
It's not the expected return.

215
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,600
It's the realized average return.

216
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,980
Now, to increase the accuracy of the market risk premium,

217
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,800
we talked about this just now, basically,

218
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
using implied numbers is going to help.

219
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,450
Essentially you want to extend your data sample

220
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,002
as much as possible.

221
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:52,210
But there are limits to that.

222
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,920
You could go further back.

223
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,660
But then it's further back.

224
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,310
It's a different period of history.

225
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,590
You can look cross-sectional to see

226
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,830
if the numbers from other markets kind of line up

227
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,260
and support your estimates.

228
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,480
But essentially, there is limited ability

229
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,640
to increase precision of that estimate.

230
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,980
Because it's ultimately based on one part of history.

231
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,430
But I would say that using implied numbers in addition

232
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,560
to historical averages definitely

233
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,375
is a useful strategy.

234
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:23,190


235
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,210
Now, let's talk about the limitations of CAPM.

236
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,550
So CAPM is widely used in practice.

237
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,615
Many firms apply it.

238
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:34,510
The majority of firms, particularly large firms,

239
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,460
use CAPM in capital budgeting, for example.

240
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,980
It's used a lot in performance evaluation as well.

241
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,800
So what are the practical limitations?

242
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,520
There are many.

243
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,400
Obviously, it's a model, a stylized model.

244
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,870
One limitation we already brought up.

245
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,120
CAPM is a static model.

246
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,300
And you have to take some additional somewhat

247
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,342
ad hoc steps to apply it, so a dynamic setting.

248
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:00,300
Other limitations are that the premise is based

249
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,508
on pretty strong assumptions.

250
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:03,600
It's about frictionless markets.

251
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,990
And in the actual markets, you may have frictions.

252
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,670
You may have market segmentation.

253
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,840
Not all investors are invested in all markets or securities.

254
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,020
You could have transaction costs or limited liquidity of assets,

255
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,650
meaning that when you trade them, actually

256
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,120
you move prices by trading.

257
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,920
So that trading itself is costly.

258
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,170
It doesn't have enough impact on prices.

259
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,370
And CAPM assumes all of that away.

260
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,080
So that's something to be aware of.

261
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,320
So CAPM is expected to work better

262
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,250
for securities that are liquid and that are broadly held.

263
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,930
And it's not going to work just on first principles

264
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,895
for securities that are illiquid and where participation

265
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:43,395
is limited.

266
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:46,100


267
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,530
Now, how can you apply CAPM to firms at an early stage?

268
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,810
Well, if you recall, it depends, of course,

269
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,810
on the context from this question is unclear.

270
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,090
Are we talking about basically thinking

271
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,910
about equity of these firms or capital budgeting?

272
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,580


273
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,677
So I just see a question.

274
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:11,260
So when we talk about liquidity, we're not talking about cash.

275
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,540
We're talking about ease of trading, ability

276
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,035
to trade securities without moving their prices.

277
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,410
So for example, large stocks, you

278
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,530
can buy them in large quantities without moving prices.

279
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,130
But small stocks, like GameStop, something

280
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,510
like that, you could move prices by trading somewhat easily.

281
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,880
So it's that kind of trading liquidity.

282
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,780
So now, if you are thinking about the context of, say,

283
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,970
estimating alphas of equity, then it

284
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,130
doesn't matter if the firm is young or not.

285
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,550
It's just that you want to have enough historical data

286
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,942
to estimate betas, that kind of stock.

287
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:49,900
But if you're thinking about capital budgeting,

288
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,380
then keep in mind that when we evaluate projects,

289
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,030
we evaluate projects.

290
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,250
It doesn't matter if the firm is young or old.

291
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,110
You want to evaluate the project itself.

292
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,970
And you want to look at the comparables.

293
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,230
So that's one caveat.

294
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,800
So in that sense, it may be a somewhat traditional kind

295
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,680
of common situation.

296
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,040
It doesn't matter that the firm is early stage.

297
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,310
However, having said that, early stage firms

298
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,530
are somewhat different, because of the high level

299
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,390
of idiosyncratic risk and the high probability of failure

300
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,610
relative to large, established firms.

301
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,160
And so what that means is that it's not so much about CAPM

302
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,030
per se.

303
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,520
It's about the overall approach to capital budgeting,

304
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,400
that maybe you want to take that kind of risk into account.

305
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,580
And that means that when you project cash flows,

306
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,400
you have to think about default risk,

307
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,130
that some of these cash flows may not be materialized.

308
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,010
Essentially you have these types of non-linearities

309
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,000
that arise due to the volatile nature and the high default

310
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,470
risk of the firm, that it may just go out of business

311
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,850
and not be able to implement the project to the end.

312
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,510
So the keyword here is real options.

313
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,690
You want to think about evaluating projects

314
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,908
with this kind of option-like structure in mind.

315
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,700
And we're not going to go deeper into that.

316
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,170
But this is forthcoming.

317
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,710
You're going to see a lecture on real options in this course.

318
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,610
And then you'll learn more about it.

319
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,960
So just kind of file that away.

320
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,720
But when you're thinking about these sort

321
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,450
of very non-linear situations, early stage

322
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,720
firms, or multi-stage projects, and whatnot, then

323
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,630
you have this important first order

324
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,050
effect coming from optionality.

325
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,733
And then, of course, it's not really about

326
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,150
how you compute the discount rate.

327
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,120
It's about how do you use discount rate in that kind

328
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,390
of non-linear setting?

329
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,120
OK, now the question is, does CAPM

330
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,540
work for financial markets outside of the US?

331
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,120
And what are the features of such markets,

332
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,350
where CAPM breaks down?

333
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,190
So here, evidence is somewhat mixed.

334
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,460
In the developed markets that are similar to the US market,

335
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,090
CAPM works better.

336
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,790
So if you think about UK, or some large European markets,

337
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,190
or Australia, then CAPM is a better approximation

338
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,928
in other places.

339
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:03,970
Although, it's not great.

340
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,780
Even in the US, it's not great.

341
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,410
But when you move to emerging markets, for example,

342
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,390
their evidence is much more problematic.

343
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,472
And it looks like CAPM doesn't work very well.

344
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:15,430
And then they say, what are the features there?

345
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,920
Why is it breaking down more for these types

346
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,910
of emerging markets other than established developed markets?

347
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,890
And that has to do a lot with market constraints

348
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,890
and frictions.

349
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,720
I will mention just a couple.

350
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,010
One is liquidity.

351
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,120
In emerging markets, very often assets have limited liquidity.

352
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,040
It means that they're hard to trade.

353
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,380
And that becomes a first order feature.

354
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,510
And the other issue is limited market participation.

355
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,260
There is market segmentation, essentially.

356
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,770
That world markets are not perfectly integrated.

357
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,060
And so when you're thinking about how

358
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,740
CAPM would apply in the local market,

359
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,330
it's kind of a delicate issue.

360
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,990
Because some of the investors are local.

361
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,090
And they may or may not be limited to the local market.

362
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,300
Some of them may have access to the global market.

363
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,220
Some of the investors are coming from abroad.

364
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,280
So if you ask, is there a reason why local market would

365
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,590
be mean very insufficient?

366
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,430
Not really, right?

367
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,770
Because the arguments of CAPM break down.

368
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,708
You don't have a population of these mean various optimizers

369
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,000
all holding the same portfolio.

370
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,860
So it has to be the local market.

371
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,560
You have different types of investors, local, domestic,

372
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,210
or foreign holding different portfolios.

373
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:39,160
So the bottom line is that the assumptions of CAPM

374
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,810
don't hold very well.

375
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,800
There are frictions.

376
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,580
There are constraints on who is able to participate in what

377
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,840
securities.

378
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,838
And because of that, theoretically, you

379
00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:51,880
wouldn't expect CAPM to hold in that environment.

380
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,070
And empirically, it looks like it doesn't.

381
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,460
So what people find is evidence that there

382
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,710
are other factors that are useful in addition

383
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,950
to the market factor, however you define that.

384
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,720
And so if you look at some super versions of the APT model

385
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,440
in the context of emerging markets,

386
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,400
there are additional factors that seem to be priced.

387
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,359
And these would be things like small stock factor

388
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,490
or some proxy for market liquidity.

389
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,630
That one is particularly important.

390
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,810
So you could use, for example, a world portfolio.

391
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,319
There's like a world CAPM using a global portfolio of stocks.

392
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,170
But in addition to that, if you use a liquidity factor,

393
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,510
that liquidity factor seems to pick up

394
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,610
a variation in average returns that just exposure to the world

395
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,140
markets doesn't fully describe.

396
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,730


397
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,710
So the next question is, what additions one

398
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,770
should consider to apply CAPM or APT in developing countries?

399
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,300
So it's again, as I said, I would look at the exposure

400
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,020
to liquidity shocks.

401
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,500
But ultimately, it's not the whole story, right?

402
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,190
Because when you have an environment

403
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:08,790
with limited ability to trade securities, imperfect markets,

404
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,090
our framework starts breaking down, this frictions framework.

405
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,760
And even idiosyncratic risk of securities

406
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,550
may matter if the investors in these companies

407
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,120
are not well diversified.

408
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,500
So I would essentially look at all of these possibilities.

409
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,460
I would look at the pricing of idiosyncratic risk.

410
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,830
Is there evidence that that matters?

411
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,620
I would definitely look at the additional APT style

412
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,320
factors, that proxy for liquidity conditions,

413
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,218
and not just exposure to the broad market.

414
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,260
So I don't have a simple answer to this question.

415
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,480
Because it's not a simple question.

416
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,350
There is academic work in this area.

417
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,960
But it's very much ongoing.

418
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,310
So we don't have well-established answers

419
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,130
to these questions.

420
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,830
But we have some tools we could use to make progress.

421
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,390
It's just that this is not finished strand of work.

422
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,155
It's in progress.

423
00:18:58,155 --> 00:19:01,810


424
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,890
The last question on this page is the following.

425
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,190
So my understanding is that CAPM is widely

426
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,050
adopted because of its effectiveness

427
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,450
and easy implementation.

428
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,180
But finance is becoming more and more data driven.

429
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,540
Will there be other models that could compete with the CAPM

430
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,920
the near future?

431
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,740
And what are the latest developments in this area?

432
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,960
So it's certainly true that there

433
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,680
is a lot of movement, a lot of progress,

434
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,590
in bringing in new types of data, big data, AI,

435
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,460
machine learning into finance.

436
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,050
So I would say that these are the most active new lines

437
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,550
of work in terms of new developments.

438
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:47,020
Would these things displace CAPM and similar models?

439
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,850
It depends on the context.

440
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,370
Again, for the purposes of capital budgeting,

441
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,800
it's not clear that the result of change.

442
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,590
But in the context of capital markets,

443
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,190
when you're think about forecasting expected returns,

444
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,590
then yes, there absolutely.

445
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,040
We are learning a lot, particularly at short horizons.

446
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,080
These models, of course, they have their limitations.

447
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,270
And these limitations get exposed with richer data

448
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,680
that is now being used.

449
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,160
And so people use unstructured data,

450
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,000
like text, which they can now process automatically.

451
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,390
They use spatial images to quantify economic activity.

452
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,920
They go to Twitter and look at the sentiment indicators there.

453
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,270
So there's a lot of stuff like that going on.

454
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,430
And it does improve our ability to forecast cash flows

455
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,310
in the short run, to identify certain kinds of market

456
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,525
inefficiency that may have existed before.

457
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:47,900
Of course, once you identify them using these techniques,

458
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,970
they quickly can get arbitraged away.

459
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,850
But I would say that that's where a lot of action is.

460
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,280
And what that means is that when you're

461
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,023
thinking about using a model to evaluate investment strategies,

462
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,440
then there is a lot more you could

463
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,780
bring to the table in addition to this kind of exposure

464
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,360
to the common risk factors.

465
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,210
You could use various kinds of signals, from characteristics,

466
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,525
and other less structured signals from the news

467
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:13,340
flow to predict returns.

468
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,380
So that's where a lot of development is taking place.

469
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,970
Again, it's in the context of investment management, trading.

470
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,660
But in capital budgeting, I don't

471
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,870
think there is a lot of change so far.

472
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,410
But we'll see what we're going to learn

473
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,580
over the next decade or two.

474
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,660
But in the short run, it seems like long horizons.

475
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,910
We have our traditional tools.

476
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:44,360
There isn't much new that we're getting from this kind of data

477
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,500
intensive approach.

478
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:54,734


479
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:57,290
CAPM versus APT.

480
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,230
I would like to hear more detail about CAPM versus APT

481
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,495
and how it fits in today's financial firms.

482
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:05,920


483
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,700
Basically, another question I'm facing yet again,

484
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,880
how is CAPM applied to firms at an early stage?

485
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,273
So essentially, these are all connected.

486
00:22:15,273 --> 00:22:17,440
There are many contexts where CAPM is not sufficient

487
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,610
and it makes sense to introduce other factors.

488
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,860
And so an early stage firm, which

489
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,625
may be exposed to shocks to financing constraints, which

490
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,500
doesn't have easy access to financial markets

491
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,600
like a large established firm would,

492
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,330
it makes sense to think about additional factors, not just

493
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,320
liquidity factor, ease of trading that we already

494
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,700
mentioned, but also perhaps, credit conditions, sort

495
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,820
of general proxies for ease of funding.

496
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,590
So CAPM versus APT, I mean, we talked about it

497
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,790
during the lecture.

498
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,890
Essentially, CAPM is a good framework

499
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,220
for thinking about systematic versus idiosyncratic risk.

500
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,950
As we have seen, in terms of its raw performance,

501
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,460
there are limitations.

502
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,020
So in some contexts, like when you evaluate performance

503
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,510
of trading strategies, it makes a lot of sense

504
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,520
to use multifactor versions.

505
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,210
So there APT brings to the table more precise descriptions

506
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,920
of systematic risk.

507
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,480
Let's see.

508
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,730
Let's say measuring performance of portfolio managers,

509
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,850
you would want to use factors in addition to the market,

510
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,850
maybe to capture the exposure to a particular style,

511
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,820
different kinds of risks they may be picking up.

512
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,890
But in the context of capital budgeting,

513
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,010
people have been kind of careful introducing other factors.

514
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,860
Because as you do that, you're kind of mixing noise

515
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,190
with the signal.

516
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,930
And if exposure to these other factors is not very stable,

517
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,740
then they're not very reliable for making long term forecasts

518
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,150
of discount rates for projects.

519
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,710
So in that context, CAPM actually is pretty widely used.

520
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,870
And it's just a practical consideration.

521
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,670
If we could come up with a reliable, robust, better model,

522
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,630
it would get adopted.

523
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,730
We haven't seen that yet.

524
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,800
But APT is a strong contender.

525
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,310
Because it does bring additional elements to the table

526
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,940
that simple CAPM, which is based on very strong assumptions,

527
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,970
may be missing.

528
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,560
Does CAPM work for financial markets outside of the US?

529
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,290
We already discussed that.

530
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,410
It does work better in the developed markets.

531
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,010
And it is not as successful, it doesn't work as well

532
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,860
in developing economies.

533
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,410
And basically, the features of the markets

534
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,840
are essentially how close they seem

535
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,083
to be to our idealized assumptions.

536
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,250
Do they look like they're more or less frictionless?

537
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,840
Is that a good assumption?

538
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,780
Is investor participation unconstrained?

539
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,000
Do radical changes in money supply

540
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,880
have implications for CAPM?

541
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,920
Or is it othogonal because the entire market

542
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,050
is exposed to any effects?

543
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:57,990
So that's asked and answered to some degree.

544
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,880
Shocks to money supply are going to affect the broad market.

545
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,560
And under CAPM assumptions, that doesn't create a second factor.

546
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,270
That just gets priced through the market.

547
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,840
So in the CAPM framework, you would have that taking place.

548
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,230
We don't explicitly acknowledge essentially

549
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,490
what moves the market, right?

550
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,870
We are agnostic.

551
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,530
But monetary supply shocks would be among the shocks.

552
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,420
And they're priced through the exposure to the market.

553
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,940
In reality, if you think that CAPM is an approximation,

554
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,330
would it be that shocks to money supply

555
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,450
create departures from CAPM.

556
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,640
You may want to have an additional risk factor

557
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,840
capture in that.

558
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,460
I would say as a hypothesis, this

559
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,550
is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis to entertain.

560
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,620
I don't have an empirical answer to that.

561
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,180
You have to analyze it.

562
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:50,450
But my hunch is that at least in some segments of the market,

563
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,510
monetary policy shocks are going to be priced directly,

564
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,870
not just through the market.

565
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,520
So there's going to be a second factor.

566
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,440
And the reason for that is that ultimately, money supply does

567
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,330
affect liquidity in the market.

568
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,130
It's not the market kind of liquidity,

569
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,140
like transaction costs.

570
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,560
But it's more like funding liquidity,

571
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,970
ease of obtaining funding, and gaining leverage, and whatnot.

572
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,690
All of that is going to be affected by monetary policy

573
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,800
shocks.

574
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:26,120
And for securities where their investors

575
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,370
are relying on ability to lever up, that's going to matter.

576
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,260
So that's my --

577
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,440
call it educated guess.

578
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,230
But I would guess that monetary policy

579
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,580
shocks would be priced, in addition to the market

580
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,080
exposure.

581
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,370
But it's a conjecture.

582
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,280
And you can dig through the literature and see.

583
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,680
Someone must have looked into it already.

584
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,690
But there is more content too.

585
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,450
The trouble with doing this, the challenge,

586
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,390
is that we don't have a huge historical sample.

587
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,260
Essentially, monetary policy is evolving over time as a policy.

588
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,830
And that, of course, affects how these shocks are priced

589
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,910
in the financial markets.

590
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,430
We don't have a huge amount of data.

591
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,350
But nonetheless, for first principles,

592
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:10,380
it would seem like it will be priced.

593
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,840
On the theme of CAPM versus APT, someone suggested a video,

594
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,680
this is a lecture by Andrew Lo talking about derivation

595
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,120
of CAPM from a single factor APT based on Steve Ross's paper.

596
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,410
If you're curious, I encourage you to take a look.

597
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,100
This was the memorial lecture for Steve Ross

598
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,710
that we held here at MIT.

599
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,300
It covers several interesting topics.

600
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,300
And I thought the presentations were very good.

601
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,870
So you could see kind of the broad cross-section of topics

602
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,840
related to Steve's work, both in asset

603
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,360
pricing and corporate finance.

604
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,470
So then based on that observation, here's

605
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,340
the question.

606
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,350
In this derivation, there are not assumptions

607
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,270
that we have made in the derivation of CAPM.

608
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,300
It's purely based on the arbitrage argument.

609
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,060
Then why do we say that CAPM is an equilibrium model

610
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,230
and not that it's a special case of multifactor APT?

611
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,470
Well, let me remind you that we actually

612
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,590
made the same observation in Fin II, right?

613
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,450
When we derived the CAPM, we did notice

614
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,750
that it looks exactly like one factor APT.

615
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,270
So that's the observation that Andrew is making.

616
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,180
It's identical.

617
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,030
Essentially, this doesn't establish the CAPM.

618
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:33,380
Because it simply points out that if you have a one factor

619
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,780
structure in the APT framework, you're

620
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,730
going to end up with the same pricing equation

621
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,900
as you obtain if you follow CAPM assumptions.

622
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,540
If you don't have a one factor structure in the APT framework,

623
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,490
then you don't.

624
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:50,120
By the way, in the one factor APT structure,

625
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,890
you have to do some work, actually,

626
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,170
some additional stuff to convince yourself

627
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:59,180
that factor and the market portfolio are the same thing.

628
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,720
That may not necessarily follow.

629
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,200
So there is a lot of kind of slippage there.

630
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,110
But nonetheless-- so mathematically, one factor APT

631
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,270
and CAPM look the same.

632
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,210
But of course, they're based on different assumptions.

633
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,800
There is nothing in the APT framework

634
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,940
that says that you have to have a single factor.

635
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,450
The whole reason why Steve introduced this model

636
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,460
is to allow for multiple risk factors.

637
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,280
And the empirical evidence is that there are multiple risk

638
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,365
factors.

639
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,490
So why do we say that CAPM is an equilibrium model?

640
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,630
Well, it is based on certain assumptions

641
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,838
about investor behavior.

642
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:36,630
So we're basically saying that if investors

643
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,430
are mean variance optimizers, then

644
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,830
using equilibrium arguments, we can show

645
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,210
that the CAPM formula holds.

646
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,260
Can we achieve the same result using arbitrage arguments?

647
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,453
Starting from the same assumptions, no.

648
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,620
You cannot start with the mean variance assumptions,

649
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,830
use arbitrage arguments, and derive the CAPM formula.

650
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,430
So APT argument, arbitrage argument,

651
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,640
starts from strong statistical assumptions, single factor

652
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,050
structure, and then derives the same formula.

653
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,050
So it's basically different initial assumptions,

654
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,290
different arguments, same result in one special case.

655
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:12,160
In that sense, CAPM is very different from APT.

656
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,900
Do equilibrium and arbitrage conditions

657
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,137
coincide in this case?

658
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:17,470
So the conditions themselves, of course, don't coincide.

659
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,950
They have very different meaning.

660
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,150
Equilibrium simply says that supply equals demand.

661
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,300
For every share bought, someone must have sold it.

662
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,390
So that's sort of just a feature of reality.

663
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,060
Arbitrage conditions tell you that there is no free lunch.

664
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,060
And that's a very different property of the market.

665
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,920
In this particular case, you end up

666
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,330
with the same pricing formula.

667
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,090
But in other respects, these economies, of course,

668
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,060
are very different.

669
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,277
So in general, CAPM and APT are not the same.

670
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,360
You add the second factor.

671
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,370
And they basically are going to generally look different.

672
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,760
CAPM doesn't need to hold in the APT framework.

673
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,220
All right, this brings us the following question.

674
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,890
Given that this is MIT, why was Intertemporal Capital Asset

675
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,230
Pricing Model, ICAPM, of Robert Merton not discussed?

676
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,250
Should a person of finance delve deeper into CAPM extensions?

677
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:16,050
Or is the base theory fundamentally sufficient?

678
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,010
It's a very good question.

679
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,900
As it happens, I teach three different courses at MIT.

680
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,890
And I discuss Bob Martin's ICAPM in two of them,

681
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,980
two out of three.

682
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,960
And the one where we don't cover it is the foundations course.

683
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,240
Because ICAPM is a somewhat advanced model.

684
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,080
Should one go deeper into extensions of CAPM?

685
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,260
Yeah, if you want to learn more about finance, of course.

686
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,600
Again, this is an introductory course.

687
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,390
I wouldn't tell you that what we cover here is sufficient.

688
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,340
The reality is that it's an open field, right?

689
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,430
It's a very complex subject in a sense

690
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,760
that once you go to the boundary of our knowledge,

691
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,760
there's a lot more stuff still to be uncovered.

692
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,520
So nothing is sufficient.

693
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,312
Should ICAPM be a part of the toolbox

694
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:07,020
if you want to be a finance professional?

695
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,130
Yes.

696
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,960
Should it be in the introductory course?

697
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,170
Typically, it's not because of the overhead required.

698
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:19,950
Having said that, let me tell you a few things about ICAPM.

699
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:25,320
So ICAPM is mathematical, equivalent to APT,

700
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,880
if you look at the formula.

701
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,680
It basically says that if you look

702
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,027
at the risk premium of any security,

703
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:33,610
you could express it as the following.

704
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,750
It's going to be beta of the security on the market

705
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:40,050
times the market risk premium plus

706
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,930
some additional components, which

707
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:46,140
look like betas on some other factors

708
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,390
different from the market, times their risk premium.

709
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,100
So these R bar K, they are expected returns

710
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,840
on the factor-mimicking portfolios.

711
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,040


712
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,220
Now, mathematically it looks the same.

713
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,810
Should we say that ICAPM is redundant,

714
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,030
is just a special case of APT?

715
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,865
Well, it's kind of the same thing as with CAPM, right?

716
00:33:08,865 --> 00:33:09,990
The formula looks the same.

717
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,240
But assumptions are different.

718
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,660
And the meaning of the formula is not exactly the same.

719
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,870
So the mimicking portfolios, what factors do they mimic?

720
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,670
That's kind of the key question.

721
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,550
APT is silent about that.

722
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,100
It will tell you that whatever factors show up

723
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,020
in the factor structure of returns,

724
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,828
that's what's going to drive the risk premium.

725
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:32,370
But it doesn't tell you which factors

726
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,740
are supposed to drive the perception of returns

727
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,300
in that factor model ratio.

728
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,990
ICAPM is actually specific about the nature of these factors.

729
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:47,350
ICAPM says that these are portfolios that mimic shocks

730
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,470
to investment opportunities.

731
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,150
What are investment opportunities?

732
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,790
They are essentially things like interest rates,

733
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,350
expected returns, volatility.

734
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,020
It's kind of anything that describes the distribution

735
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,270
of returns on the totality of assets

736
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,740
in the market going forward.

737
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,510


738
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,010
So that's different from APT, right?

739
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,427
So now you think about, well, what

740
00:34:08,427 --> 00:34:13,190
about these macro shocks, shocks to output, oil price, this

741
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,889
and that?

742
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,760
Well, they are going to be a part of ICAPM

743
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,580
only if these shocks correspond to changes

744
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,376
in investment opportunities in the financial markets.

745
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:30,860
So the content of the factors is not the same.

746
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,179
Now, let's talk a bit more about the intuition of ICAPM.

747
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,469
Why is this the case?

748
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:38,860
Why are we saying that these additional price

749
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,070
factors have to be shocks to investment opportunities?

750
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,530
Now, to derive it rigorously, we need a couple

751
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,449
of advanced mathematical tools.

752
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:50,780
The original derivation used dynamic programming.

753
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,690
This is optimization method for multivariate problems

754
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,250
and use stochastic calculus.

755
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,540
Stochastic calculus is also, of course,

756
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,750
the basis for option pricing in continuous time.

757
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,420
So it has these two ingredients.

758
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,110
And we don't have space in the introductory class

759
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,130
to cover both of them.

760
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,490
Because they take quite a bit of time to develop.

761
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:18,270
So we are going to barge into it without the mathematical tools

762
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,340
and just talk about the intuition.

763
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,740
I think that we can gain a lot of insight

764
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,990
without deriving it formally.

765
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,600
Let's consider the following motivating example, instead of

766
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,870
the mathematical derivation.

767
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,220
Alice is an investor.

768
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:37,020
Let's say she is highly risk averse, make it real simple.

769
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,580
And she's facing a market with two securities only.

770
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,030
They are two bonds, risk-free bonds, default free bonds.

771
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,580
One bond has a horizon of one year.

772
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,950
And the other one has a horizon of 20 years.

773
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,180
And they are both discount bonds.

774
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,870
So the way it's going to go is that at time zero

775
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,810
she has these two bonds available, one and 20 years.

776
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,420
And then a year later, the 20 year bond

777
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,280
is going to have 19 years left to maturity.

778
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,190
And then 18 years is going to kind

779
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,085
of shrink, approach maturity.

780
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:08,460
And the one year bond, of course,

781
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,127
is going to mature after the first year.

782
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,400
Then you can roll over.

783
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,360
Each year you have a new one year treasury bond available.

784
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,710
OK, so that's the market.

785
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,590
Now, let's consider two hypotheticals.

786
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,500
Suppose that Alice has a one year horizon.

787
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,270
How will she invest?

788
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,150
Well, I would say that because she is so highly risk averse,

789
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,180
she is going to invest 100% of her portfolio

790
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,310
in a one year bond.

791
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,210
Why is that?

792
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,260
Because over a one year horizon, a 20 year bond is risky.

793
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,000
We don't know at what price you'll

794
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,130
be able to sell it a year from now,

795
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,290
when the bond has 19 years left to go.

796
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,610
So that's interest rate risk that we talked about in Fin I,

797
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,660
right?

798
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,880
Long duration bond has interest rate risk.

799
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,250
One year bond, risk-free.

800
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,750
You know exactly what you're going to get one year from now.

801
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,750
A risk-free investment is what a highly risk averse

802
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,000
investor is going to pick.

803
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,200
Fine, so that's simple enough.

804
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,860
Now, what if Alice has a 20 year horizon?

805
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,970
How will she invest then?

806
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,810
Well, at the 20 year horizon, things flip.

807
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,870
Now, a 20 year bond is risk-free.

808
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,150
Because you know exactly what the bond

809
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,290
is going to pay 20 years from now.

810
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,120
What about the one year bond?

811
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,160
Well, if you buy a one year bond at time zero,

812
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,130
and then you roll over the next year, and then roll over again,

813
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,220
you don't know the future spot interest rates.

814
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,410
So you're going to keep rolling over.

815
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,760
And your ultimate portfolio value would be random.

816
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,380
It will depend on the path of interest rates.

817
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,420
So with a 20 year horizon, the notion of a safe asset

818
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,290
changed, right?

819
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,130
Now, a 20 year bond is safe.

820
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,570
And this kind of strategy of buying one year bond is risky.

821
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,780
So as an aside, this brings up a very important notion

822
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:03,060
that what constitutes a safe asset differs across investors.

823
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,450
In this particular example, it differs in relation

824
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,230
to the investment horizon.

825
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,230
But there could be other dimensions of differences.

826
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,540
So that is very important.

827
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,490
Because sometimes it's how would people think about safe asset?

828
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,740
They think a Treasury bond.

829
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,640
But that's very narrow.

830
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,890
That's only for a particular class of investors.

831
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:27,710
OK, so we concluded that this risk averse investor

832
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:32,480
is going to hold 100% of her portfolio in the 20 year bond.

833
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,750
Because that asset gives a safe payoff 20 years later.

834
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,450


835
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,730
What about the short term volatility

836
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,080
of the 20 year bond, right?

837
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,610
She is highly risk averse.

838
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:48,670
Why is she taking on this kind of volatility?

839
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,780
Well, here is the thing.

840
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,070
With a long investment horizon, this kind of short term

841
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,460
mean and volatility of returns is not the whole story.

842
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,100
Think about from Alice's point of view.

843
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,610
If the 20 year bond drops over the next year,

844
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,090
is that a big problem?

845
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,270
Well, if she had to liquidate at that time,

846
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,320
it would be a problem.

847
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,980
But she's going to hold that bond to maturity.

848
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,750
So if the bond price falls after the first year, what that means

849
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,200
is that the rate of returns from that point until maturity

850
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,130
is going to be higher.

851
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,660


852
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,620
And things kind of cancel out.

853
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,840
So when the bond price declines, future returns are better.

854
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,450
What this highlights is a particular special case

855
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,300
of the general notion that changes

856
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,910
in investment opportunities matter, in addition to shocks

857
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,600
to the portfolio value.

858
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,320
So if I have a long horizon as an investor,

859
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,720
I don't just care about the mean and the variance

860
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,060
of my portfolio return over the short horizon.

861
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:53,140
I also care about, how will I be able to reinvest my money

862
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,150
after the first period?

863
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,010
I care about the investment opportunities

864
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,050
I will be facing at the end of the first period.

865
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,230
More than that, I care about the joint distribution

866
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,620
of my portfolio return and my investment opportunities.

867
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,530
In this case, this 20 year bond has the property

868
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,310
that bond returns are perfectly correlated with changes

869
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,710
in investment opportunities negatively.

870
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:18,460
The bond price falls, gives you a low or negative return.

871
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,830
In the state of the world where future interest

872
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,890
rates are higher, investment opportunities are better.

873
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,640
And vise versa, the bond price rises in value

874
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,320
when future interest rates are lower.

875
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,170
So this illustrates the notion that for a long horizon

876
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,050
investor, the short term mean variance objective is not

877
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:37,740
right.

878
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,570
There are going to be other considerations

879
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,790
in their objective.

880
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,590
And here we have to essentially take it

881
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,660
on faith it's coming from dynamic programming.

882
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,460
These other considerations have to do

883
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,000
with the value of investment opportunities

884
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,060
together will develop the portfolio.

885
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,610
So when it's all said and done, we

886
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:59,450
end up with the I-CAPM calculation

887
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,600
that tells you that the risk premium on every security

888
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,500
is based on the market data and the market risk premium.

889
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:12,110
And on top of that, it's exposure to the shocks

890
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,990
to investment opportunities times the risk

891
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,940
premium of these shocks.

892
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,190
And so these mimicking portfolios,

893
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,320
they're called hedging portfolios.

894
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,350
These are portfolios of traded securities that

895
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:29,030
best approximate or hedge shocks to investment opportunities.

896
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,000
In case of long term interest rates, this would be bonds.

897
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,850
In case of other dimensions of investment opportunities,

898
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,370
it's other securities or portfolios of securities.

899
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:42,910
So that's ICAPM.

900
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,700
So at the end of the day, if you're going to ICAPM,

901
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,830
it's going to look almost indistinguishable

902
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:52,300
from using APT, except ICAPM requires more discipline

903
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,710
in the choice of factors.

904
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,290
You have to use factors that respond to shocks to investment

905
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,532
opportunities.

906
00:41:57,532 --> 00:42:02,950


907
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:09,510
Now, let me go back to the following result, which

908
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,440
we had in the course.

909
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,660
This is the failure of CAPM.

910
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,370
This is actually one of the more problematic failures of CAPM.

911
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:22,020
The security market line is pretty flat, right?

912
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,960
So this is not a new result. It was first

913
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,680
observed by Mike Jensen, Fischer Black, and Myron Schultz.

914
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,130
In 1972, they did some empirical analysis.

915
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,410
They published a paper about a very well known paper

916
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,420
that documented this kind of failure of CAPM.

917
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,960
And then recently, there was a resurgence

918
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,750
of interest in this result. People reestablished it again.

919
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,890
And this made it into the space of quant trading strategists.

920
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,280
Now if you're interested in things like smart beta

921
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,010
strategies, people talk about betting against beta

922
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,480
or low risk strategies.

923
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,550
This is going to be based on this idea

924
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:04,200
that it appears that low beta stocks earn pretty high returns

925
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,820
compared to the market risk.

926
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,530
And their average returns are not

927
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,910
very different from high beta stocks.

928
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,650
So if you buy a low beta stocks and you lever up

929
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,530
and you short high beta stocks, you get rid of market risk.

930
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,960
You have an alpha left.

931
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,630
So this looks like a problem for the CAPM.

932
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,590
If you take these results at face value,

933
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,690
then it's definitely an issue.

934
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:32,723
Now, Fischer Black made the following observation.

935
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:33,890
So this is his picture here.

936
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,400
This is not my observation.

937
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,540
This is his.

938
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,430
And of course, he is Fischer Black

939
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,590
from the Black, Schultz, Merton fame.

940
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,890
And he was one of the most influential thinkers

941
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,180
in finance.

942
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:51,530
And of course, on our faculty at MIT.

943
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:55,520
So he basically said that if you look at these results

944
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,730
and you see that CAPM fails, that actually is even more

945
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,800
interesting than if it worked.

946
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,790
So it doesn't mean that beta is useless.

947
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,550
It actually makes very useful.

948
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,580
And think about the following possibility.

949
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,460
Suppose that you are a firm which

950
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,770
has pretty unrestricted access to the bond market,

951
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:14,690
to financial markets.

952
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,523
You can raise money.

953
00:44:15,523 --> 00:44:17,940
You could lever up if you want.

954
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,120
Well, what you can do then is invest

955
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:26,460
in low risk projects, which have these high discount rates.

956
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,920
So they are basically cheap, low price, high discount rate.

957
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,388
And then you lever up and then sell equity to the market.

958
00:44:35,388 --> 00:44:36,055
So what happens?

959
00:44:36,055 --> 00:44:38,680


960
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,470
You are able to generate money by levering up by doing that,

961
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:42,970
right?

962
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:46,930
Because as you lever up, your required rate of return

963
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,780
doesn't seem to rise much, right?

964
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,430
So you take a project that has a beta of 0.5.

965
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,250
And then you use that to finance half of it

966
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,180
and finance half of it with equity, right?

967
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,180
And then you sell the whole thing to the market.

968
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,980
Now your beta is not 0.5.

969
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,510
Now that you used debt to finance, your beta of equity

970
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,940
is one, right?

971
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,930
If half of it is debt, half of it is equities,

972
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:15,180
you sell equity to the market.

973
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,698
Beta is one.

974
00:45:16,698 --> 00:45:18,240
Normal would say, well, then you risk

975
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,280
premium is going to go up by a factor of two.

976
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,392
So there is an arbitrage there, right?

977
00:45:23,392 --> 00:45:25,350
But in this case, if you believe this relation,

978
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,475
that's not going to happen.

979
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:27,970
Your risk premium doesn't go up.

980
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,020
So there is arbitrage.

981
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,500
You can basically make money, increase the value of the firm,

982
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,100
by using leverage.

983
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,630
Now, you're going to learn about M&M proposition, Modigliani

984
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,170
and Miller, another product of MIT finance group.

985
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,060
This was Franco Modigliani's contribution,

986
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,393
one of his contributions.

987
00:45:45,393 --> 00:45:47,810
And that's going to tell you the exact opposite, that it's

988
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,150
impossible to increase the value of the enterprise using

989
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,020
leverage.

990
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,760
Because there is no free lunch.

991
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,500
If you replace some of the equity

992
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,630
financing with debt financing, yeah,

993
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,640
that has lower discount rates.

994
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,720
But you're going to make your equity more risky.

995
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,137
And then the cost of capital and equity is going to go up.

996
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:06,262
And so when you look at the weighted average, which

997
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:07,950
is the discount rate for the whole firm,

998
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,850
that does not change.

999
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,410
It cannot change.

1000
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,660
You're just kind of splitting cash flows between debt

1001
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,440
and equity.

1002
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,300
But the properties of the whole don't change.

1003
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,740
So if you take this graph at its face value,

1004
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,230
then it violates the M&M proposition.

1005
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:24,340
And there is arbitrage in the market.

1006
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,980
So basically, what Fischer Black was

1007
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,450
saying that either these firms that can lever up

1008
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,000
would be able to take advantage of that.

1009
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,700
And they can invest in low risk projects

1010
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,670
and use a lot of leverage to make money out of it.

1011
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,670
Or maybe this relation actually doesn't quite apply.

1012
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:46,650
Or firms don't have access to easy funding in the bond

1013
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,230
market.

1014
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:51,290
But essentially, this is either some kind

1015
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,710
of market failure in terms of constraints

1016
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,710
in the financial market.

1017
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,870
Or it's an opportunity for firms.

1018
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:01,310
But in either case, if the firms were able to lever up, then

1019
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,530
even though this is how equity is priced,

1020
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,750
when the firms look at projects, they would use CAPM.

1021
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:11,270
Because they understand that low risk project

1022
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,340
it actually is not cheap.

1023
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,970
It's going to give them positive NTV.

1024
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,930
They can figure out the true value

1025
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,080
of using the CAPM formula.

1026
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,455
Because that's going to take into

1027
00:47:19,455 --> 00:47:22,760
account their ability to lever up and sell equity

1028
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,510
to the market.

1029
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,480
So that's kind of the observation.

1030
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,970
Now what is the flaw in that argument?

1031
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,720
Well, of course, Fisher was very aware of that.

1032
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,270
He's essentially playing devil's advocate here,

1033
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,980
saying that if you take this relation

1034
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,900
as a stable structural relation, then

1035
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,470
you're going to have those types of interesting effects.

1036
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:47,025
But the flaw in this argument is that just because empirical

1037
00:47:47,025 --> 00:47:51,090
and some high beta stocks and low beta stocks

1038
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:53,100
tend to have similar average returns,

1039
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,130
doesn't mean that if you take a lower beta project

1040
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,980
and you lever it up, your discount rate is not

1041
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,138
going to rise.

1042
00:48:01,138 --> 00:48:02,930
Because this is not of structural relation.

1043
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:05,157
It's like this is about calculations.

1044
00:48:05,157 --> 00:48:06,740
And when you start levering up and you

1045
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,950
expect to move along this blue line on average,

1046
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,750
then you think it's a causal relation.

1047
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,190
That doesn't follow.

1048
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:14,910
OK?

1049
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:18,060
So it could be that when you simply apply leverage, then

1050
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,197
your CAPM relation holds very well.

1051
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:21,780
Because otherwise, there is arbitrage.

1052
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,930
If you just apply leverage, then you double your risk,

1053
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,417
you double your expected excess return.

1054
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:29,250
But when you look across firms, what happens

1055
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,980
is that there are these firms on the right with high beta.

1056
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,260
They are different from firms on the left,

1057
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,660
not just in terms of the market beta.

1058
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,830
But something else is different about it.

1059
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,610
So if you live in the multifactor world,

1060
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,760
then what you're seeing is differences in market betas.

1061
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,250
But you don't see differences in other factors.

1062
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:51,300
And that could potentially explain why the security market

1063
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,560
line is flat.

1064
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,480
Because you are missing other factors.

1065
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,430
That's an explanation potentially.

1066
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,850
So let's look at that.

1067
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,340
Again, to recap, people came up with arguments

1068
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,680
trying to explain this kind of relation of the data.

1069
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,152
And the arguments rely on things like constraints.

1070
00:49:08,152 --> 00:49:10,360
They basically said that if investors are constrained

1071
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,920
in terms of leverage, they are going to essentially undervalue

1072
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,210
these low beta stocks.

1073
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,460
Because they cannot get sufficiently high levels

1074
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,640
of return from them.

1075
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,070
They would like high beta stocks.

1076
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,870
Because it's a substitute for leverage.

1077
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,940
But firms that have access to leverage,

1078
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,590
they can take advantage of that.

1079
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:29,140
And they use a lot of leverage together with low risk

1080
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,060
investments to make money.

1081
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,090
So that's kind of the argument on the supply side.

1082
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,050
That firms can arbitrage this way.

1083
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:39,730
But what I want to pursue now is the alternative line,

1084
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,670
which is that we have missing factors at play potentially

1085
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:46,370
and that this is just a partial picture of risk.

1086
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,880
So I will walk you quickly through an exercise.

1087
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,010
This is based on my own paper with my former student,

1088
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,450
Dimitris Papanikolaou.

1089
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,510


1090
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,810
He's now on faculty at Yale.

1091
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:01,643
So he's a colleague more than a student now.

1092
00:50:01,643 --> 00:50:07,200
But we looked at the following issue in relation

1093
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,240
to the flat security market line and other effects.

1094
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,040
So the issue is the following.

1095
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,970
If you look at the differences in average accounts

1096
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,180
across firms, you could see that they're not fully captured

1097
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,470
by the CAPM beta.

1098
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,850
There are other dimensions.

1099
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,250
And in particular, firm characteristics

1100
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,810
can predict returns.

1101
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:28,265
And also, you could come up with these long short portfolios,

1102
00:50:28,265 --> 00:50:29,640
kind of like with Fama and French

1103
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,240
did, sold stocks on market to bulk or on size,

1104
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,990
and create additional factors.

1105
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,420
And these factors are priced.

1106
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,890
And they're not spent by the market portfolio.

1107
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,440
So that's a general observation.

1108
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,980
And let me show you a few motivating results.

1109
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,460
So here, we're going to replicate a few of these

1110
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,660
examples of the failure of CAPM.

1111
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,810
So here is one, market beta.

1112
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:56,760
This is a representation as a table of the picture.

1113
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,810
It says that let's sort stocks on their market beta

1114
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,790
from low beta to high beta.

1115
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:06,210
And let's look at their average excess returns

1116
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:09,220
and see how CAPM is able to explain them.

1117
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,060
So what you see is historical.

1118
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,170
This is for a period from 1965 to 2008.

1119
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,170
The low beta firms compared to high beta firms

1120
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,910
have pretty similar returns.

1121
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,570
They may be slightly higher.

1122
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,870
But that's statistical and not distinguishable.

1123
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:28,560
And essentially, it's a flat security market line.

1124
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,060
Of course, betas are very different.

1125
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,150
For the low beta firms, beta is .7 on average.

1126
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,030
The high beta firms it's almost 1.5.

1127
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,010
So the expected returns are similar.

1128
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,370
Betas are very different.

1129
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:43,770
And that means that CAPM doesn't describe these average returns.

1130
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,700
There is a violation.

1131
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,210
There is a CAPM alpha.

1132
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,710
So if you look at the high beta firms versus low beta firms,

1133
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,920
and you create a long short portfolio, where

1134
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,970
you go along high beta firms and your short dollar for dollar

1135
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:02,910
low beta firms, what you find is a negative CAPM alpha, right?

1136
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:07,760
And if you take this long short portfolio

1137
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,490
and you ask, what kind of systematic risk is in it,

1138
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:13,700
well, this portfolio is very well diversified.

1139
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,860
It has lots of securities, basically

1140
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,640
20% of the market, so hundreds of securities.

1141
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,650
It has some kind of market risk, of course.

1142
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:25,110
If you are aggressive on the market, there is an r-squared.

1143
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:25,610
Why?

1144
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,500
Because you're going long on high beta stocks

1145
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,880
and short low beta stocks.

1146
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,700
So your long short portfolio has a positive market beta of 0.75.

1147
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,380
But at the end of the day, the market

1148
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,420
explains only a quarter of the variance.

1149
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,455
So what is going on?

1150
00:52:40,455 --> 00:52:42,830
Idiosyncratic variance should have been diversified away.

1151
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,050
But it didn't somehow.

1152
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:48,050
Well, actually, idiosyncratic variance did.

1153
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:51,540
What is left here is some kind of systematic risk factor.

1154
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,360
There are other systematic risk factors

1155
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,150
that don't get diversified when they go long short.

1156
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,050
It's exactly the argument that we applied

1157
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,827
when we talked about APT.

1158
00:52:59,827 --> 00:53:01,160
So there are other factors here.

1159
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,570
We don't know what they are.

1160
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,490
But there is evidence that they are there.

1161
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:09,260
Because the r-squared on the market is closer to 0 than to 1

1162
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,482
in a well diversified portfolio.

1163
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:13,940
And so then we do the same exercise

1164
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,320
for other kinds of sorts.

1165
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,540
So here is the sort on the so-called

1166
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,570
Tobin's Q. Think of it as an enterprise level

1167
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,333
market to book ratio.

1168
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,500
It's kind of analogous to the Fama and French market

1169
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,135
to book or for equity.

1170
00:53:26,135 --> 00:53:27,510
And here again, you see the value

1171
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,090
of stocks versus growth stocks have

1172
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,830
very different average returns.

1173
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:32,870
Value stocks have high average returns.

1174
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:36,170
Growth stocks have low historical average returns.

1175
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,900
The market beta doesn't align with expected returns.

1176
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,890
It kind of goes in the wrong direction.

1177
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:43,790
So there is a strong pattern of alphas there.

1178
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,700
And again, a long short portfolio, the market

1179
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,500
doesn't explain much.

1180
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,620
The portfolio itself is pretty volatile, right?

1181
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,110
So there's a lot of residual systematic risk,

1182
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:58,127
just not market risk, other kinds of systematic risk.

1183
00:53:58,127 --> 00:53:59,460
We do the same for other things.

1184
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,740
We sort firms on their past investment.

1185
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,520
Very similar, firms that invested a lot versus--

1186
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,090
yeah, sorry.

1187
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:09,180
This is firms that invested a little on the left versus firms

1188
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:12,660
that invest a lot on the right have different average returns.

1189
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,830
CAPM doesn't explain it.

1190
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:18,180
If you go long short, you have a large CAPM alpha.

1191
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,890
Again, a well diversified portfolio

1192
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:25,520
with a lot of residual risk not captured by the market.

1193
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,650
You sort on the enterprise level earnings

1194
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,720
to price ratio, similar results.

1195
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,020
And even on idiosyncratic stock return volatility.

1196
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,630
This is stock specific return volatility not captured

1197
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:37,160
by the common factors.

1198
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,410
And again, you see that the long shot

1199
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:43,700
portfolio is highly volatile, not captured by the market.

1200
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:48,000
And CAPM fails to describe it.

1201
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,370
So all of these facts they point to the limitations of CAPM.

1202
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:55,580
They also point to the existence of additional risk factors.

1203
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,740
Otherwise, our long short portfolio

1204
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,045
would have very low volatility.

1205
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,920
And these outflows would look like arbitrage.

1206
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,540
But they don't.

1207
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,310
It looks like you have a strategy that

1208
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,040
has some kind of average rate of return,

1209
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,570
but also has a lot of residual risk.

1210
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:10,920
So then we do the following.

1211
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,310
We take all of these five cross-sections of portfolios,

1212
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,450
sort it on the market beta on market

1213
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:20,570
to book on past investment, idiosyncratic volatility.

1214
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:23,370
Take all these different cross-sections.

1215
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:26,640
If you look at the composition of these long short portfolios,

1216
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,163
high versus low, they all look pretty different.

1217
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:31,080
You don't have a lot of overlapping membership

1218
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,890
in these portfolios.

1219
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,920
But when they extract the common component of returns

1220
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,990
in these cross-sections, this is done

1221
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,400
using so-called principal component analysis, when

1222
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,710
extract the common source of variation in each of these five

1223
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,450
cross-sections, they seem to be strongly related

1224
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:47,770
to each other statistically.

1225
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,750
So it looks like each of these cross-sections

1226
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,120
has an important common factor.

1227
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,160
And these common factors are highly related

1228
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,600
across the cross-sections.

1229
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,090
So the pairwise correlation is pretty high.

1230
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,600
And there is a common factor across all of these five

1231
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,330
cross-sections that seem to apply to each of them,

1232
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,830
even though mechanically if you look

1233
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,720
at the membership in these portfolios,

1234
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,560
you don't see such a strong pattern.

1235
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,460
So there is a strong statistical relation between them,

1236
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,530
a common source of variation.

1237
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:18,540
That starts to sound very much like APT.

1238
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:25,890
Well, so then what we did is we created a second factor, which

1239
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:28,170
is based on the common source of movement

1240
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:32,730
in these 50 portfolios, five sections, 10 portfolios each.

1241
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:36,220
This factor is uncorrelated with the market by construction.

1242
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,370
So it's a common source of variation other

1243
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:39,690
than the market.

1244
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:42,510
And it shows up here in the last row.

1245
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:46,500
And what you see is that each of these cross-sections.

1246
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,280
It loads strongly on this second component in addition

1247
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,150
to the market.

1248
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:54,240
And now when you look at the alphas in this two factor

1249
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,370
model, which is the two factor APT model,

1250
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,860
alphas shrunk towards zero.

1251
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,990
And the key statistics basically show that now they

1252
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,880
are no longer significant.

1253
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,870
Let me show you the same result graphically.

1254
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:10,260
I'm going to skip this table.

1255
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,130
It's a different way of presenting the data.

1256
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:14,130
So here is a graphical illustration of the end.

1257
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,400
What's going on?

1258
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,390
If you look at the panel on the left,

1259
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:22,800
on the horizontal axis it shows the expected return according

1260
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,420
to CAPM-- this is the fitted expected return--

1261
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,720
this is the forecast of what expected return should

1262
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,420
be if CAPM is the right model.

1263
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,890
On the vertical axis, you looked at

1264
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:35,890
the average historical return, realized return.

1265
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,720
They are supposed to fall in the 45 degree line subject

1266
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,830
to some statistical noise.

1267
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,350
But they should align on the 45 degree line.

1268
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:43,700
They don't.

1269
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,650
You see that realized return essentially

1270
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:49,310
has almost no relation to the theoretical expected return.

1271
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:53,360
If anything, the relation seems to be almost negative.

1272
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,320
Now, if you just see that, you never learned anything else,

1273
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,820
you're going to say, well, that looks like a horrible model.

1274
00:57:58,820 --> 00:57:59,903
Why would you even bother?

1275
00:57:59,903 --> 00:58:01,390
But obviously, these cross-sections

1276
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,500
the reason why we're looking at them

1277
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,510
is because we learned that they're problematic.

1278
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,950
If you do other types of sorts, the CAPM

1279
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,290
is going to fare better.

1280
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:12,340
But we found these things that are problematic for CAPM.

1281
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,860
They're also related to each other based on some underlying

1282
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,560
economics.

1283
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,210
So it's not completely random.

1284
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:20,590
So now, when you look at the panel on the right,

1285
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:25,540
here this plots the expected returns, or return forecasts,

1286
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,100
using a two factor model.

1287
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,990
This is an APT extension.

1288
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,940
You have your market component.

1289
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,172
And then you have the second factor,

1290
00:58:34,172 --> 00:58:36,130
which is our principal component, common source

1291
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,350
of variation in these 50 portfolios

1292
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,460
other than the market.

1293
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,910
That's our factor.

1294
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:43,450
So we estimate the beta of each portfolio

1295
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,600
on that factor and use that to predict returns.

1296
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,100
And now, it aligns a lot better with the 45 degree line.

1297
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,750
There is one portfolio that sticks out.

1298
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:55,030
The rest of them actually align pretty well.

1299
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,670
This portfolio that sticks out is the portfolio

1300
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,590
of the stocks with the highest level

1301
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:01,600
of idiosyncratic volatility.

1302
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,840
And these stocks just have negative returns

1303
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,100
on average in sample.

1304
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,010
And they're not explained even by this two factor model.

1305
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,098
These stocks basically, there are good reasons

1306
00:59:11,098 --> 00:59:12,640
to think that they will be mispriced.

1307
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,440
Because they are subject to short selling constraints.

1308
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,860
So the trading on these stocks is not unconstrained.

1309
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:21,700
They can be easily overpriced, but lower returns.

1310
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,530
So what's the bottom line?

1311
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:27,040
There does appear to be a second common factor, at least.

1312
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,070
So it's not an accident that the security market was flat, OK?

1313
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,890
And this second common component,

1314
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:38,010
it does connect together these different cross-sections

1315
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,761
that are based on very different kinds of sorts.

1316
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:43,620
Idiosyncratic volatility sort versus sorting market

1317
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:47,340
to book versus sorting market beta looks all very distinct.

1318
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,200
But at the end of the day, they're related.

1319
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,890
There is a common underlying source of risk.

1320
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,610
OK, so I'm going to stop here.

1321
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:58,770
This is one example of how you go from CAPM to APT,

1322
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:01,413
and how you could make some sense

1323
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:02,580
of these types of relations.

1324
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:08,810
But going back to Fischer Black's observation,

1325
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:12,158
as you invest in the low risk projects and then you lever up,

1326
01:00:12,158 --> 01:00:13,700
you're going to end up with something

1327
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,180
that looks different from the high beta firms.

1328
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,930
And they're going to be different in terms

1329
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:19,880
of the exposure to those additional factors.

1330
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:29,150


1331
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:33,110
This is all I wanted to cover today in terms of my materials.

1332
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:34,970
The handout will be posted.

1333
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:37,430
So you could have it for your reference.

1334
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:39,090
If you have any additional questions,

1335
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:42,270
maybe reach out through the forum.

1336
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,540
Otherwise, thank you for your time and keep on going.

1337
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:49,490
There is a lot of exciting stuff to cover in the course.

1338
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,000
