1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,940
PROFESSOR: In this section, we discuss the typical sequence

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,280
of steps needed to implement the CAPM model in practice.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,670
We also point out the advantages of using

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,020
CAPM or a similar model relative to the direct estimation

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,720
of expected returns.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,560
Suppose we want to estimate the expected returns on two stocks.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,710
We will call them IBM and Dell, but the numbers we use

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,580
are hypothetical.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,720
First, we need to decide how to measure returns

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,060
on the market portfolio.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,910
For this purpose, it is common to approximate the market

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,840
as a diversified value-weighted portfolio of stocks,

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,010
for instance, an S&P 500 index or evaluate

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,700
the portfolio of all public firms traded on major stock

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,590
exchanges.

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,350
Second, we run a linear regression

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,830
of individual stock returns on the market return

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,940
in order to estimate stock betas.

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,440
Suppose we find that the market beta for IBM is 0.8,

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,390
and for Dell, it is higher--

21
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,020
1.3.

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,890
Third, we estimate the market risk premium.

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,880
For instance, we may compute the historical average

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,100
of excess returns on the market portfolio.

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,250
Suppose we find that the market risk premium is 6%.

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,800
We'll look up the current risk free rate.

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,030
Suppose it is 2%.

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,710
Finally, we apply the CAPM formula.

29
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,590
In case of IBM, the risk free rate

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,820
of 2% plus the beta of 0.8 times the market premium of 6%

31
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,920
gives us the expected return of 6.8%.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,190
For Dell, which has a higher market beta,

33
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,110
we obtain a higher estimate of expected return--

34
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,610
9.8%.

35
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,420


36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,860
What are the advantages of using models like CAPM and APT

37
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,320
to estimate expected returns on stocks?

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,639
Why don't we simply use average historical returns

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,450
to estimate expected return?

40
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,030
Assuming that the true distribution of stock returns

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,350
is stable over time, which means that past data is

42
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,170
informative about the future distribution,

43
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,360
there is nothing fundamentally wrong with using

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,030
historical average returns.

45
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,680
However, historical samples of returns on individual assets

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,220
may be too short to estimate the expected returns

47
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,080
with necessary precision.

48
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,710
It is also quite possible that as companies

49
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,040
change their properties over time, the risk

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,130
and expected returns change.

51
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,040
In this case, even if a long series

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,950
of past returns of a stock is available,

53
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,570
we may not be able to use it to forecast future returns.

54
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,410
That is because the same firm many years ago may have

55
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,100
had very different properties.

56
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,980
How do models like CAPM and APT help

57
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,660
us deal with such challenges?

58
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,740
First, from the point of view of statistical inference,

59
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,290
we can often estimate return betas

60
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,980
with much more precision than expected returns.

61
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,960
And importantly, we can do so using relatively short samples

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,460
with frequent observations.

63
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,080
For example, one may be able to obtain a high precision

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,290
estimate of the market beta of a stock using

65
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,850
only six months of daily data, while it

66
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,630
may take decades of data to obtain a comparably accurate

67
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,085
estimate of expected returns.

68
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:49,000


69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,510
Of course, both CAPM and APT require

70
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,620
us to estimate the market price of systematic risk.

71
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,000
For example, in case of CAPM, we need to know the risk premium

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,050
on the market portfolio.

73
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,400
For that, we may have to use the average historical return

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,510
or explore other alternatives, for instance, backing out

75
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,019
the discount rate on the market from a forward-looking stock

76
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,560
valuation model, like the Gordon model.

77
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,620
Here, it's important to note that even if we

78
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,850
do use the historical average returns to estimate the market

79
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,330
risk premium, this is a more tractable problem

80
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,740
than estimating expected returns on the individual stocks.

81
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,070
First, the market portfolio is less volatile.

82
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,440
It has no idiosyncratic risk.

83
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,890
This helps with precision.

84
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,890
Second, we have access to a relatively long

85
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,710
historical return series for the market,

86
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,190
certainly much longer than for the majority of stocks.

87
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,760
This, again, helps with precision.

88
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,160
Finally, although the distribution

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,900
of returns on the market portfolio

90
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,450
may not be constant over time, it

91
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,850
is arguably more stable than for individual stocks.

92
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,110
In summary, the key advantage of using risk-based models

93
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,460
like CAPM and APT to estimate the expected returns

94
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,640
is that we can derive expected return estimates

95
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,930
from the estimates of systematic risk.

96
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,770
We do not need to rely on the average past returns

97
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,500
in order to estimate the expected future returns.

98
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,000
