00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,009
PROFESSOR: In this segment, we discuss

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,940
the relation between risk and return under the CAPM model.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,540
Under CAPM, the risk premium of any stock

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,680
is proportional to its market beta.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,220
This is a linear relationship between risk and return.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,610
And we can represent that graphically.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:27,020
On the graph, we show the market beta on the horizontal axis.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,970
On the vertical axis, we show the expected return of a stock.

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,410
The risk-free asset, for example,

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,200
is on the vertical axis because its market beta is zero.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,540
We represent the linear CAPM relation

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,110
between systematic risk and expected return

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,290
as a straight line, which is called the security market

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,860
line or, in short, SML.

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,520
We should not confuse this with the capital market line, which

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,060
represents the lowest possible standard deviation of portfolio

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,160
return for a given level of expected return.

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,250
In addition to the risk-free asset,

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,820
the security market line passes through a point representing

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,970
the market portfolio.

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,960
For this point, the market beta is equal to 1.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,620
And the expected return is the market expected return.

23
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,160
We see that the slope of the security market line

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,350
is equal to the market risk premium.

25
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,610
For any other asset, we can determine its expected return

26
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,460
in relation to its market beta according

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,130
to the linear relation plotted here.

28
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,000
As an example, suppose that CAPM holds.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,120
The expected market return is 8%.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,600
And the risk-free rate is 2%.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,590
In this market, any asset with zero market beta

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,570
earns the same expected return as the risk-free rate.

33
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,090
Note that this is true even if this asset is highly volatile.

34
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,260
Under CAPM, such an asset has only idiosyncratic risk.

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,080
And such risk is not compensated by the market.

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Any asset with the market beta of 1

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,680
has the expected return equal to the market expected return,

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,650
which is 8%.

39
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,130
Again, an asset could be much more volatile

40
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,140
than the market portfolio.

41
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,880
Yet, it earns the same expected return.

42
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,020
The reason is that total return volatility is not

43
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,300
the right measure of risk.

44
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,580
The market beta is.

45
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,870
Investors in this framework do not hold a single asset.

46
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,570
They hold the market portfolio, which

47
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,170
benefits from diversification.

48
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,450
As a result, from the perspective

49
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,360
of these diversified investors, an asset

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,600
contributes to their portfolio risk in proportion

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,980
to its market beta.

52
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,750
Market beta is the right measure of stocks systematic risk

53
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,470
not its total volatility or variance.

54
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,340
Next, consider an asset with the market beta of 0.5.

55
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,910
Systematic risk of this asset is lower than that of the market

56
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,470
portfolio by a factor of 2.

57
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,890
According to CAPM, the risk premium of this asset

58
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,560
is also lower by the same factor.

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,190
We conclude that the expected return on such an asset

60
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,060
should be the risk-free rate or 2%

61
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,550
plus its beta, 0.5, scaled by the market risk premium, which

62
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,380
is 6%.

63
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,780
The result is 5%.

64
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,690
Finally, suppose we have an asset with the market

65
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,680
beta of minus 0.6.

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,780
For this asset, using the CAPM formula,

67
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,480
we find the expected return of minus 1.6%.

68
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,470
It is negative.

69
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,660
Why would investors be willing to hold

70
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,190
an asset with a negative expected return.

71
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,070
The reason is that having an asset

72
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,180
like that in the portfolio helps lower the overall portfolio

73
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,620
risk.

74
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,290
This asset effectively provides insurance

75
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,209
against market declines.

76
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,430
Such insurance is costly.

77
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,050
And this cost amounts to losing 1.6% in expectation

78
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,230
on each dollar invested in the asset.

79
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,360
We now consider the risk return trade-off

80
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,260
under CAPM from a slightly different angle.

81
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,700
For any asset we can decompose its excess return

82
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,930
by regressing it on the market excess return using the OLS

83
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,600
regression.

84
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,250
As a result, the excess return is equal to the intercept

85
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,960
or alpha plus the excess return on the market

86
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,620
scaled by the slope coefficient, which is equal to the asset's

87
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,460
market beta.

88
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,870
Plus the residual, which is 0 in expectation and is

89
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,430
uncorrelated with the market return.

90
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,750
Note that this decomposition has nothing to do with the CAPM.

91
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,040
We can always decompose asset returns in such manner.

92
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,530
What we have here is a mathematical identity.

93
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,530
CAPM tells us something more.

94
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,790
Under CAPM, the intercept, the alpha of the asset,

95
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,920
must be equal to 0.

96
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,530
In empirical analysis, it is very common

97
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,260
to express the implication of the CAPM

98
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,910
as we have here as a restriction on the intercept in the OLS

99
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,210
regression of the stock's excess return

100
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,720
on the market excess return.

101
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,310
If CAPM holds, alphas of all assets should be 0.

102
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,010
Alpha is, therefore, a measure of violation

103
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,810
of the CAPM formula.

104
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,510
A non-zero alpha implies that an asset earns expected return

105
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,520
above and beyond what is justified

106
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,660
by its systematic risk, or its market beta.

107
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,910
What should we think if we encounter an asset

108
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,790
with a positive or negative alpha?

109
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,660
Is this evidence of mispricing or an attractive investment

110
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,840
opportunity?

111
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,260
First, we need to worry about estimation errors.

112
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,110
True values of the coefficients in our regression

113
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,640
are not known.

114
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,470
Our empirical estimates based on the past return data are noisy.

115
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,300
Our estimates may also be biased if the distribution of returns

116
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,880
is not stable across time.

117
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,190
This is the case of past returns not

118
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,500
predicting future performance.

119
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,770
It is a lot easier to find alpha in past data

120
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,320
than to realize it in actual investments going forward.

121
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,710
We should also keep in mind that if CAPM fails,

122
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,990
alpha may not represent a free lunch.

123
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,150
It may reflect markets compensation

124
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,090
for other sources of systematic risk, which

125
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,220
are distinct from the market return,

126
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,980
yet, important to investors.

127
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,260
There may be many other reasons for the failure

128
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,500
of CAPM in the data.

129
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,160
CAPM is a theoretical model based on strong assumptions

130
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,410
about the market and investors.

131
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,720
Various trading frictions, including

132
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,140
transaction costs, constraints on positions,

133
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,740
as well as taxes and capital gains and dividends,

134
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,800
may lead to deviations from the CAPM relation.

135
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,700
Yet, these deviations may not be easy to exploit,

136
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,850
in part because of the frictions that give rise to them.

137
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,150
We now consider how exactly an investor could take

138
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,340
advantage of CAPM violations.

139
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,440
Suppose that the alpha in our return

140
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,480
decomposition is non-zero.

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,420
Consider a mean variance optimizing investor.

142
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,570
We want to know how this investor should deviate

143
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,020
from holding the market portfolio in order to exploit

144
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,940
a CAPM violation or mispricing.

145
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,630
We will show that if CAPM is violated,

146
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,710
an investor can achieve a higher Sharpe

147
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,560
ratio than what is offered by the market portfolio.

148
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,380
And we will compute the highest possible Sharpe ratio

149
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,580
explicitly.

150
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,190
To simplify our analysis, let's first

151
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,990
construct a particular portfolio.

152
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,460
Call it portfolio P. Portfolio P includes three positions.

153
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,929
A $1 long position in stock i, which is our mispriced asset.

154
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,750
A position in the market portfolio,

155
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,710
which equals in size the negative of the market

156
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,160
beta of stock i.

157
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,030
So if our stock has a positive market beta,

158
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,440
this will be a short position in the market portfolio.

159
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,190
Finally, the third position is beta dollars

160
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,960
invested at the risk-free rate.

161
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,700
The total investment in portfolio P is $1.

162
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,160
The portfolio return is described

163
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,300
by the following equation.

164
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,950
It is a weighted average of returns on the three portfolio

165
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,080
positions.

166
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,620
This is the return on asset i minus its beta

167
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,750
times the excess return on the market portfolio.

168
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,900
Using the above decomposition of the return on asset i,

169
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,140
we find that the return on portfolio P

170
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,950
equals the risk-free rate plus the alpha

171
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,730
of asset i plus its idiosyncratic return,

172
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,560
epsilon i.

173
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,070
Know that, by construction, the return on portfolio P

174
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,390
is uncorrelated with the market return.

175
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,630
Moreover, the Sharpe ratio of this portfolio

176
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,290
is equal to the ratio of the alpha of asset i

177
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,800
to the standard deviation of its idiosyncratic return,

178
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,540
epsilon i.

179
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,370


180
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,410
Note that instead of deciding how

181
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,620
to invest in a combination of the market portfolio and asset

182
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,970
i, we can equivalently solve for the mean variance optimal

183
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,400
combination of the market portfolio

184
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,090
and portfolio P. In other words, we

185
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,720
want to find the tangency portfolio using two assets--

186
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,140
portfolio P and the market portfolio.

187
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,010
Using the general solution for the tangency portfolio, which

188
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,940
in this case is particularly simple because the two assets--

189
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,370
the market portfolio and portfolio P--

190
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,620
are uncorrelated, we find that the weight on the market

191
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,460
is proportional to the ratio of the market risk premium

192
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,110
to the market return variance.

193
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,830
The weight on portfolio P in the tangency portfolio

194
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,350
is proportional to the ratio of its risk premium,

195
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,820
which is alpha i, to its return variance, which

196
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,290
is the variance of epsilon i.

197
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,970
After a little algebra, we find that the Sharpe

198
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,780
ratio of the tangency portfolio is

199
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,970
the square root of the sum of squares of the Sharpe

200
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,020
ratios of the market portfolio and portfolio P. This

201
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,080
is a useful formula to keep in mind in general

202
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,470
as it applies to portfolios with uncorrelated assets.

203
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,640
In summary, we see that whenever CAPM is violated

204
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,520
investors have an opportunity to improve their Sharpe

205
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,780
ratio by deviating from the market portfolio.

206
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,260
Failure of the CAPM means that the market portfolio

207
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,320
is not on the efficient frontier and does not

208
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,710
have the highest possible Sharpe ratio.

209
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,740
The magnitude of the violation of the CAPM

210
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,410
can be summarized by the possible improvement

211
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,800
in the Sharpe ratio, which in turn is

212
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,510
a function of the Sharpe ratio of portfolio P.

213
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,500
It's the ratio of the alpha of the mispriced asset

214
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,820
to its idiosyncratic volatility.
