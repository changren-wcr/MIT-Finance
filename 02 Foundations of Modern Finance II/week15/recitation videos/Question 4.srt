1
00:00:00,245 --> 00:00:01,620
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,050
learn how to empirically estimate CAPM betas.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,340
We will work with eight firms: four gold mining firms,

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,780
and four technology firms.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,650
These are the same firms we used to estimate two-factor APT

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,260
model in the first part of this course.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,680
The table on your screen shows you firm names and location

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,530
of their headquarters.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,920
Our data set contains monthly return observations

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,710
for each firm from January 2005, until December 2019.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,750
Therefore, for each firm we have 180 monthly return

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,430
observations.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,640
Returns are given in column C. We're also

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,710
given the risk free rate in column D.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,340
And we're given market return in column E.

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,320
To estimate the CAPM model, we need

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,290
to run the regression of excess return

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,300
on a stock on a constant, and on the excess market return.

19
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,160
Therefore, the first step for us is

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,100
to compute the excess return for each of our stocks

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,470
and to compute excess market return.

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,980
To compute excess return, I'm taking the return on the stock

23
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,170
and I'm subtracting the risk free rate.

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,970
And to compute excess market return,

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm taking the market return and I'm

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,160
subtracting the risk free rate.

27
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,210
Let's start by estimating the CAPM model for the first stock.

28
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,990
There are multiple ways to run a linear regression in Excel,

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,900
I will use LINEST function, the same function

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,700
I used in the first part of the course

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,310
when we estimated the APT model.

32
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,810
It requires four inputs.

33
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,210
The first input is the left hand side variable,

34
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,470
which in our case is the excess return on the stock.

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,790
The second input is the vector of known axis,

36
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,190
which in our case is the excess market return, just one vector.

37
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,730
The third input to this function is whether the regression

38
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,680
is run with a constant or not.

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,372
We want to have a constant.

40
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:58,580
And the fourth parameter is for additional regression

41
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,500
statistics, which we don't need in this case.

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,560
So this is an array function.

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,140
We need to hit Shift Control Enter at the same time

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,140
so that we estimate both beta and alpha in the CAPM equation.

45
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,220
We see that the CAPM beta for the Kinross Gold Corporation

46
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:24,140
is 0.54 and CAPM alpha for this stock is 0.45%

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,460
Next let's estimate the CAPM regression for Apple stock.

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,870
We have Apple data further the down in this array.

49
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:39,020
And I will select excess returns as my y variable, excess market

50
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,750
returns as my x variable.

51
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,260
And I'll put the other two parameters as one and zero.

52
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,210
So this gives us the CAPM beta for Apple of 1.07

53
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,000
and the CAPM alpha for the stock, 2.05%.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have estimated the CAPM regression

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,690
for the remaining six stocks and here are the results.

56
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:06,110
CAPM betas for gold mining stocks vary from 0.32 to 0.54.

57
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:12,920
And CAPM betas for technology stocks vary from 0.89 to 1.07.

58
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,280
These results show that gold mining stocks

59
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,800
have much lower return sensitivity

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,380
with respect to the market when compared to technology stocks.

61
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,430
Now we can use estimated betas to find future expected returns

62
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,380
using the capital asset pricing model.

63
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,420
Let's assume that future monthly expected return on the market

64
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,370
is 0.8%.

65
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,700
This is roughly 10% effective annual rate.

66
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,220
According to the capital asset pricing model,

67
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,730
the expected excess return on the stock

68
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,960
is given by beta times the expected excess return

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,340
on the market.

70
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,060
Now we can use this equation to find expected excess returns

71
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,650
on our stocks.

72
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,690
For Kinross Gold Corporation, it's

73
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,720
going to be beta of the stock multiplied

74
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,350
by the expected excess return on the market portfolio.

75
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,220
So the answer is going forward, the stock

76
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,130
is expected to return 0.43%.

77
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,029
We can extend this array and compute expected excess returns

78
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,010
for the remaining gold stocks and also for the technology

79
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,850
stocks.

80
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,650
For comparison, let's also compute

81
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,630
historical average excess returns

82
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,490
during our sample period, 2005 to 2019.

83
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,280
To do this, I'm using the average function

84
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,070
and our excess returns on each individual stock

85
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,515
to compute these averages.

86
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,390
We can see that the average historical return

87
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:50,110
for gold mining stocks ranges from 0.64 to 0.84%

88
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,250
and for technology stock, it ranges from 1% for Intel

89
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,710
to 2.84% for Apple.

90
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,310
Notice that for all eight of our stocks

91
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,340
the expected returns computed using the capital asset pricing

92
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,160
model are lower than the historical average returns.

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,050
Recall that the reason why we prefer to rely on asset pricing

94
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,340
models, such as the CAPM or the APT

95
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,830
to compute expected returns instead of using

96
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,950
historical averages is that it is extremely difficult

97
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,580
to infer average returns from historical data.

98
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,470
To demonstrate this, let's compute

99
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,210
95% confidence intervals for our estimates of average returns.

100
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,875
For each of our eight stocks, I compute

101
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,080
a historical standard deviation, which

102
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,800
I used to compute 95% confidence interval.

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,790
And in the last two columns.

104
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,250
I computed the lower and the upper bounds of this 95%

105
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,750
confidence interval.

106
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,780
We can see that for each stock the range is very wide.

107
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,990
For example, for the first stock the estimate

108
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,180
of average monthly return falls from negative 1.36% to positive

109
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,320
3.04% with a 95% probability.

110
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,200
This imprecision is exactly why in finance we

111
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,750
use asset pricing models to forecast future returns.

112
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,287
