00:00:00,245 --> 00:00:01,620
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,770
learn how a firm's financial leverage affects its equity

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,030
risk.

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,970
Company XYZ is a publicly traded firm.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,590
The current share price of XYZ is $22.50.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,430
The total number of outstanding shares is 20 million.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,290
XYZ has 525,000 bonds outstanding,

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,570
each with a face value of $100, maturing one year from now.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,860
Bonds do not pay coupon and are considered risk-free.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,880
XYZ's stock has a market beta of 0.8.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,700
The expected market risk premium is 6%,

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,400
and the risk-free rate is 5%.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,020
We will answer the following questions.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,780
What is the current market value of the firm?

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,290
What is the market beta of the firm?

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,260
Suppose that beta of the firm's assets and the expected

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,650
interest rates are constant over the next two years.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,980
What is the expected price of the stock in two years if it

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,840
does not pay dividends?

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,430
We will assume that the performance

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,940
of the company in year 1 does not predict its performance

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,910
in year 2.

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,470
Finally, if the firm issues 551,250

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:16,020
two-year, zero-coupon bonds with a face value of $100 each

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,240
to buy back its stock, will it change

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,590
the equity beta of the firm?

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,170
If yes, compute the new equity beta.

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,820
Suppose that investors consider these new bonds risk-free.

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
Let's first find the current market value of the firm.

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,540
Since this firm has both equity and debt in its capital

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,820
structure, the market value of this firm

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,920
would equal to the current market

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,320
value of equity plus the current market value of debt.

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,583
So let's find each of them.

35
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,000
The current market value of equity

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,430
would equal to the current share price multiplied

37
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,100
by the total number of shares outstanding.

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,840
In this case, this is $22.50 multiplied by 20 million.

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,990
This gives us $450 million.

40
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,730
And the current market value of debt

41
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,210
is simply the total face value of debt,

42
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,660
which is $100, multiplied by 525,000 bonds discounted

43
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,940
to present at the risk-free rate.

44
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,590
We're discounting at the risk-free rate

45
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,190
because this debt is considered, by the market participants,

46
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,390
risk-free.

47
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,330
Therefore, the current market value of this firm's debt

48
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,540
is $50 million.

49
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,980
Also note that we're discounting this by one year

50
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,350
because this debt is due in one year.

51
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,140
This gives us the current market value

52
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,110
of the firm, which we also refer to as the current market

53
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,450
value of the firm's assets.

54
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,200
It equals to $500 million.

55
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,710
Next, let's find the market beta of the firm's assets.

56
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,280
Recall two facts.

57
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,790
First, the firm's assets are a portfolio

58
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,830
of its equity and debt.

59
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,110
And, two, the beta of a portfolio

60
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,500
is a weighted average of betas of assets in the portfolio.

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,920
This implies that asset beta is the weighted average

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,340
of equity beta and debt beta, where the weights are

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,190
the fraction of equity and debt in the capital

64
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,460
structure of the firm.

65
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,040
Recall that this firm's debt is risk-free.

66
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,970
Therefore, its market beta equals to 0.

67
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,350
Hence, we have the following.

68
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,060
Asset beta equals to the market value

69
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,390
of equity divided by the sum of the market value of equity

70
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,190
and the market value of debt multiplied by the equity beta.

71
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,790
This gives us $450 million divided by $500 million

72
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,010
multiplied by 0.8.

73
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,680
And this gives us 0.72.

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,230
Therefore, the beta of this firm's assets is 0.72.

75
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,110
Note that the assets of the firm are safer than equity.

76
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:47,090
The market beta is 0.72 versus the beta of equity of 0.8.

77
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,740
This is because the presence of debt

78
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,080
amplifies the risk of equity.

79
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,330
The higher is the fraction of debt in a firm's capital

80
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,840
structure, which we refer to as leverage, the higher

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,630
is its equity risk.

82
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,190
Next, let's find the expected stock price in year 2.

83
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,790
Recall the dividend discount model,

84
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,630
which says that the stock price today equals to dividend

85
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,770
in year 1 discounted to present plus dividend in year 2

86
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,670
plus the value of the stock in year 2 discounted to present.

87
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,480
The discount rates, r1 and r2, are the returns

88
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,150
on the stock in years 1 and 2.

89
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,020
Since this stock does not pay dividends, its price in year 2

90
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,100
would equal to its current price multiplied by 1 plus r1

91
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,010
and multiplied by 1 plus r2.

92
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,560
Taking the expectation, we'd get the following.

93
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,570
Expected stock price in year 2 equals

94
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,080
to the current price multiplied by the expectation

95
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,760
of the following product--

96
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,260
1 plus stock return in year 1 multiplied by 1 plus stock

97
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,120
return in year 2.

98
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,580
Since we assume that stock performance in year 1

99
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,640
is not correlated with its performance in year 2,

100
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,030
we can break down the expectation of the product of 1

101
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:04,180
plus r1 and 1 plus r2 into the product of expectations.

102
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,550
This gives us the following expression.

103
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,280
Expected stock price in year 2 equals to the current stock

104
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,360
price multiplied by 1 plus expected return in year 1

105
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,630
multiplied by expected return in year 2.

106
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,360
We can use our standard notation, r bar,

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,520
to denote these expected returns.

108
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,580
Therefore, to determine the expected stock price in year 2,

109
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,420
we need to find the expected returns in years 1 and 2.

110
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,730
We will use the capital asset pricing model

111
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,310
to find these returns.

112
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,250
Expected return in year 1 equals to the risk-free rate

113
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,330
plus equity beta multiplied by the market risk premium.

114
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,700
Recall that the risk-free rate is 5%.

115
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,270
The equity beta was given to us, and it's 0.8.

116
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,820
And the market risk premium is 6%.

117
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,920
Therefore, year 1 expected return is 9.8%.

118
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,720
To find expected return in year 2,

119
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,780
recall that the firm pays off bonds at the end of year 1.

120
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,770
And, during the second year, this firm does not have debt.

121
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,360
In other words, it becomes an all-equity financed firm.

122
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,270
This means that equity beta during the second year

123
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,770
equals asset beta, which is 0.72.

124
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:21,145
Therefore, the expected return in year 2 is 9.32%.

125
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:23,930
Putting this all together, we find that the expected share

126
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:30,310
price in year 2 equals $27.01.

127
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,980
Finally, let's answer the question in part d.

128
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,432
Suppose that the firm issues 551,250

129
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:42,520
two-year, zero-coupon bonds with $100 face value each.

130
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,170
What is the new equity beta?

131
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,360
First, due to the leverage effect,

132
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,940
we expect equity beta to increase.

133
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,310
To find equity beta, let's use the equation

134
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,910
that ties asset beta to equity and debt betas.

135
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,630
Since both old and new tranche of debt are risk-free,

136
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,270
this equation collapses to the following one--

137
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,460
asset beta equals to the market value

138
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,580
of equity divided by the sum of the market value of equity

139
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,900
and the market value of debt multiplied by equity beta.

140
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,050
Rearranging this equation, we get the following-- equity beta

141
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,970
equals to the value of equity plus the value of debt,

142
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,090
which is just the total value of assets

143
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,270
of the firm, divided by the value of equity multiplied

144
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,370
by asset beta.

145
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,620
Note that the value of the firm does not

146
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,170
change as a result of this new debt issuance

147
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,040
because we're using cash proceeds to buy back shares.

148
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,020
To find the new value of equity, we

149
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,450
need to find the new value of debt

150
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,620
and subtract it from the total value of the firm.

151
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,170
The current market value of this new tranche of debt

152
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,980
is $50 million.

153
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,090
We're using 5% discount rate because this debt

154
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,190
is considered risk-free.

155
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,320
Note that we're discounting it by two years

156
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,540
because it matures in two years.

157
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,400
The total value of debt of this firm

158
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,650
is the sum of the market values of the old debt

159
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,540
and the new debt, which together give us $100 million.

160
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,280
Therefore, the new value of equity

161
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,250
of this firm after the bond issuance and share buyback

162
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,290
is $400 million.

163
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,050
Putting this all together, we find that the new equity

164
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,300
beta is 0.9.

165
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,570
Recall that the original equity beta was 0.8.

166
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,450
Therefore, issuing this new tranche of debt

167
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:28,500
increases equity beta of this firm from 0.8 to 0.9.

168
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,000
