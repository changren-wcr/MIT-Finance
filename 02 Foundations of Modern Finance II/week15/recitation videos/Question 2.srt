00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,940
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,855
consider multiple situations in the market

3
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:06,230
to determine whether they are consistent with the capital

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,300
asset pricing model or not.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,460
Let's start with situation number one.

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,380
We have two stocks, A and B.

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,410
The expected return on stock A is 25%,

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,290
and the expected return on stock B is 15%.

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:23,710
The beta of stock A is 0.8, and the beta of stock B is 1.2.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,290
Is this situation consistent with the capital asset pricing

11
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,340
model?

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,870
I recommend you to pause this video

13
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,590
and to try to answer this question yourself first.

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,710
This situation is not consistent with the Capital Asset Pricing

15
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,640
Model.

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,290
We can see from the CAPM equation

17
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,000
that, the higher is the beta, the higher

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,770
should be the expected return.

19
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,160
In this situation, however, we have stock B that has a higher

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,070
beta, but it has a lower expected return,

21
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,570
15% versus 25% for stock A. Therefore,

22
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,380
such a situation cannot happen in the marketplace.

23
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,380
Situation number two, stock A has

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,980
expected return 25% and a standard deviation of 30%.

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,030
And the market portfolio has expected return of 15%

26
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,640
and the standard deviation of 30%.

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,140
Is this situation consistent with the capital asset pricing

28
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,640
model?

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,260


30
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,000
This situation is not consistent with the CAPM.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,820
As shown on this graph, stock A lies

32
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,770
outside of the capital market line

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,350
and outside of the efficient frontier.

34
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,030
Therefore, the market portfolio must be inefficient.

35
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,580
Situation number three, there are three assets--

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,580
a risk-free asset with a return of 10%,

37
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,940
the market portfolio with expected return of 18%

38
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,480
and standard deviation of 24%, and stock A

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,040
with expected return of 16% and standard deviation of 12%.

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,250
Is this situation consistent with the capital asset pricing

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,030
model?

42
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,290
This situation is not consistent with the CAPM.

43
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,870
As shown on this graph, stock A lies

44
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,640
outside of the capital market line

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,130
and outside of the efficient frontier.

46
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,560
The Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,080
is 0.33 while the Sharpe ratio of stock A is 0.5.

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,790
This means that the market portfolio is not efficient,

49
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,760
which contradicts the capital asset pricing model.

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,750
Situation number four, there are three assets--

51
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,690
a risk-free asset with a return of 5% and beta of 0,

52
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,570
the market portfolio with expected return of 15%

53
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,920
and beta of 1, and stock A with expected return of 20% and beta

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,780
of 1.5.

55
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,400
Is this situation consistent with the capital asset pricing

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,900
model?

57
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,530


58
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,970
This situation is consistent with the CAPM.

59
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,560
We can use the provided information

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,820
to compute expected return on stock A. According to the CAPM,

61
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,520
it equals risk-free rate, which is 5%,

62
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,000
plus beta multiplied by the market risk premium.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,870
The beta of stock A is 1.5, and the market risk premium

64
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,790
is the difference between the expected return

65
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,550
on the market, which is 15%, and the risk-free rate,

66
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,280
which is 5%.

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,840
This gives us the expected return

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,960
on stock A, which equals 20%.

69
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,680
This return is consistent with the provided information.

70
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,140
Visually, you can see that stock A

71
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,330
lies on the security market line, which

72
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,920
is required by the CAPM.

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,610


74
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,980
Let's consider situation number five.

75
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,110
This will be our last example.

76
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,860
Suppose there are two funds.

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,420
First is the real estate fund with expected return of 30%

78
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,610
and standard deviation of 35%.

79
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,890
And the second one is private equity fund

80
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,150
with the expected return of 40% and standard deviation of 25%.

81
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,450
Is this situation consistent with the CAPM?

82
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,220


83
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,910
This situation is consistent with the CAPM.

84
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,280
Recall that investors get compensated

85
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,670
only for systematic risk, which is measured by beta,

86
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,500
rather than for the total risk, which

87
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,440
is measured by the standard deviation of returns.

88
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,440
The total risk contains idiosyncratic risk

89
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,800
for which investors do not get extra compensation because they

90
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,260
can diversify this risk away.

91
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,870
Therefore, the fact that the real estate fund

92
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,190
offers low expected return and has higher standard deviation

93
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,620
does not mean that CAPM is violated

94
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,553
or that there is no place for such asset in the market.

95
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:26,053
