1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,730
PROFESSOR: Suppose that an endowment fund is currently

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,210
investing 20% of its portfolio in the risk-free asset,

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,150
and the remaining 80% is invested in the private equity

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,400
fund called Eternal Growth.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,160
The endowment fund analyzed holdings of Eternal Growth's

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,920
portfolio and found that its expected returns

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,890
over the next year will be 10%, and standard deviation

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,440
will be 25%.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,300
Research conducted by the endowment fund

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,610
indicates that the market portfolio

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,200
will have expected return of 10% and standard deviation of 20%

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,765
during the next year.

13
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:34,890
The correlation of returns between Eternal Growth's

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,270
portfolio and the market portfolio is 0.8.

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,170
Suppose the risk-free asset will yield

16
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,040
5% return over the next year.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,410
We will answer the following questions.

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,160
Compute CAPM beta of Eternal Growth's portfolio.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,330
Compute CAPM beta and alpha of the endowment fund's portfolio.

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,250
Suppose that you were retained as an advisor

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,930
to the endowment fund.

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,370
Would you recommend divesting part

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,320
of the holdings in Eternal Growth

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,480
and reallocating them to the market portfolio?

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,940
Let's start with the first question.

26
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,610
Recall that CAPM beta for portfolio P

27
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,550
is the correlation of returns on this portfolio with the market

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,880
multiplied by the standard deviation of this portfolio

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,180
returns divided by the standard deviation of the returns

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,190
on the market portfolio.

31
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,610
In our case, the correlation of returns between Eternal Growth

32
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,620
and the market is 0.8.

33
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,590
The standard deviation of returns of Eternal Growth

34
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,510
portfolio is 25%.

35
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,510
And the standard deviation of returns of the market portfolio

36
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,950
is 20%.

37
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,530
Putting this all together, the CAPM beta of Eternal Growth

38
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,690
portfolio is 1.

39
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,070
Next, let's find CAPM beta and alpha of the endowment fund.

40
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,900
Let's start with beta.

41
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,820
Recall that the endowment fund is invested

42
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,330
20% into the risk-free asset and 80%

43
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,340
into the Eternal Growth fund.

44
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,370
Therefore, CAPM beta of the endowment fund

45
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,140
would be the weighted average of CAPM

46
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,470
betas of the risk-free asset and of the Eternal Growth.

47
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,510
The beta of the risk-free asset is 0,

48
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,250
and the beta of the Eternal Growth fund,

49
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,250
which we found in the previous question, is 1.

50
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,480
Therefore, the beta of the endowment fund is 0.8.

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,120
In order to find CAPM alpha, let's first compute

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,180
the expected return on this endowment fund given

53
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,460
its portfolio allocation.

54
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,180
Recall that it's 20% risk-free asset and 80% the Eternal

55
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,350
Growth fund.

56
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,710
Therefore, the expected return on the endowment fund

57
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,950
is 20% times the return on the risk-free asset

58
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,310
plus 80% times the expected return on the Eternal Growth

59
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,060
fund.

60
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,860
This is 20% times 5% plus 80% times 10%.

61
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,730
This gives us 9%.

62
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,210
We can compute CAPM alpha as the difference between the expected

63
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,660
return that the endowment fund expects to generate,

64
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,910
which we just computed-- it is 9%--

65
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,720
and the expected return under the capital asset pricing model

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,720
given its systematic risk exposure.

67
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,510
Given the beta of 0.8, the expected return

68
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,720
on the endowment fund under the capital asset pricing model

69
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,650
is the risk-free rate plus beta multiplied by the market risk

70
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,460
premium.

71
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,740
Recall that the risk-free rate is 5%,

72
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,020
and the expected return on the market portfolio is 10%.

73
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,440
Therefore, under the CAPM, the expected return

74
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,180
on the endowment fund should be 9%.

75
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,860
Putting this all together, we get

76
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,200
that the CAPM alpha of this endowment fund is 0%.

77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,990


78
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,050
Finally, let's answer the last question.

79
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,390
You are an advisor to this endowment fund.

80
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,490
Do you recommend to partially reallocate assets

81
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,250
from Eternal Growth fund to the market portfolio?

82
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,937
The answer is yes, you should recommend such reallocation.

83
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,270
The easiest way to see it is to compare the Sharpe ratio

84
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,040
on the endowment fund with the Sharpe ratio

85
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,878
on the market portfolio.

86
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,170
You can see that the Sharpe ratio of the endowment fund

87
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,670
is 0.2.

88
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,460
It is computed as the expected return on the endowment fund,

89
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,490
9%, minus the risk-free rate, 5%,

90
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,340
divided by the standard deviation of this endowment

91
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,043
fund, 20%.

92
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:10,460
The standard deviation is computed

93
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,390
by multiplying 80%, which is the allocation to the Eternal

94
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,930
Growth fund, multiplied by the standard deviation

95
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,920
of the Eternal Growth fund, which is 25%.

96
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,490
And the Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio is 0.25.

97
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,270
This means that the portfolio of the endowment fund

98
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,150
is not efficient, and its risk-return trade-off

99
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,420
can be improved by reallocating assets from the Eternal Growth

100
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,550
fund to the market portfolio.

101
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,880
It is also useful to represent the situation graphically.

102
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,600
On this chart, I've plotted the capital market line.

103
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
I've plotted the market portfolio.

104
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,690
This is the red dot.

105
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,360
It has expected return of 10% and the standard deviation

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,860
of 20%.

107
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,930
I've plotted the Eternal Growth fund,

108
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,380
which has the standard deviation of 25% and expected

109
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,300
return of 10%.

110
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,300
And I also plotted the endowment fund portfolio.

111
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,770
That's the yellow dot.

112
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,330
It has 9% expected return and 20% standard deviation.

113
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,790
You can see that the Sharpe ratio, which

114
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,310
is the slope of the line that connects

115
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,710
the risk-free rate and the endowment fund and the Eternal

116
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,230
Growth fund, is lower than the slope

117
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,340
of the solid blue line, which is the capital market line.

118
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,340
Therefore, this graph confirms the inefficiency

119
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,360
of the endowment fund's portfolio.
