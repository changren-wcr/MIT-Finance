00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,000
PROFESSOR: In this video, we're given a portfolio

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,250
with a known expected return.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,800
We will assume that it is priced by the capital asset pricing

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,490
model.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,700
And we will learn how to find its beta, standard deviation,

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,614
and its correlation with the market portfolio.

7
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:18,450
Suppose that the expected return on the market portfolio is 14%,

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,230
and the standard deviation of its returns is 25%.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,720
The risk-free rate is 6%.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,410
Consider a portfolio with expected return of 16%,

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,780
and assume that it is located on the capital market line.

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,770
In other words, assume that it is priced by the capital asset

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,720
pricing model.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,120
What is the beta of this portfolio?

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,040
What is the standard deviation?

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,310
And what is the correlation of this portfolio with the market?

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,640
Let's start with the first question.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,060
The CAPM model says that the expected return on a portfolio

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,620
P equals to the risk-free rate plus beta of this portfolio

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,500
multiplied by the expected return on the market portfolio

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,660
minus the risk-free rate.

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,769
We're given the expected return on our portfolio P. It is 16%.

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,440
We're given the risk-free rate, which is 6%.

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,120
And we're given the expected return

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,010
on the market portfolio, which is 14%.

26
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,950
So we can solve this equation for beta

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,780
and find that the beta of this portfolio is 1.25.

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,210
To find the standard deviation of this portfolio, let's

29
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,160
replicate it with the market portfolio

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,560
and the risk-free asset.

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,540
Since this portfolio, which we will call P,

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,570
is efficient because it is on the capital market line,

33
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,640
the expected return and the standard deviation

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,090
of this portfolio should be the same as the expected return

35
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,790
and standard deviation of the replicating portfolio, which

36
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,720
we'll call R. And, since we know the standard deviation of both

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,030
the market portfolio, which is 25%,

38
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,488
and the risk-free asset, which is 0%,

39
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:49,530
we will be able to compute the standard deviation

40
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,780
of this replicating portfolio.

41
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,410
Let's invest w in the risk-free asset and 1 minus w

42
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,173
in the market portfolio.

43
00:01:57,173 --> 00:01:58,590
We want this replicating portfolio

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,590
to have the expected return of 16%.

45
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,780
Therefore, we have the following equation--

46
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,990
16% equals to w multiplied by 6%, which

47
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,560
is the return of the risk-free asset, plus 1 minus w

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,990
multiplied by the 14%, which is the expected

49
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,060
return on the market.

50
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,300
Solving this equation for w gives us negative 0.25.

51
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,450
This means that the replicating portfolio

52
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,370
is 25% short the risk-free asset and 125% long the market

53
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,840
portfolio.

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,900
Since the risk-free asset has zero variance by definition

55
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,760
and the return on the risk-free asset

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,760
is not correlated with any other asset, including the market

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,700
portfolio, the variance of the replicating portfolio

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,430
equals to 1 minus w squared times

59
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,410
the variance of the market portfolio.

60
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,910
Therefore, the standard deviation

61
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,320
of this replicating portfolio R equals to 1 minus w multiplied

62
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,050
by the standard deviation of the market portfolio.

63
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,570
We know that w is negative 0.25.

64
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,383
Therefore, 1 minus w is 1.25.

65
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:59,300
The standard deviation of the market portfolio

66
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,910
is 25%, which gives us 31.25%.

67
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,620
Therefore, the standard deviation

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,052
of the portfolio with 16% expected return is 31.25%.

69
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:12,510
Finally, let's find the correlation

70
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,880
of this portfolio with the market.

71
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,430
Recall that beta of portfolio P is

72
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,250
the ratio of the covariance of returns of this portfolio

73
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,320
P with the market portfolio divided

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,170
by the variance of the market portfolio, which equals

75
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,320
to the correlation between portfolio P and M

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,690
multiplied by the standard deviation of returns

77
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,390
on portfolio P divided by the standard deviation

78
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,250
of the market portfolio.

79
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,200
We already know the beta of this portfolio

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,870
P, which we computed in the first part of this question.

81
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,513
It is 1.25.

82
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,930
And we know the standard deviation

83
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,432
of this portfolio, which we computed in the second part

84
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:46,140
of this question.

85
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,290
It is 31.25%.

86
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,160
So putting this all together gives us

87
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,450
the following equation.

88
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,600
Solving this equation for rho gives us 1.

89
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,090
Therefore, the correlation between the returns

90
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,120
on this portfolio P and the returns on the market portfolio

91
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,500
M is equal to 1.

92
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,000
