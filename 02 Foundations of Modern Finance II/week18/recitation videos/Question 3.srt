00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:02,410
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,990
consider a corporate finance situation,

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,600
known as Debt Overhang.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,610
Consider a two-period setting.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,050
Today's year is 0.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,530
Next year is year 1.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,320
We will assume that all investors are risk neutral,

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,260
and that the risk-free rate is 0%.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,600
These assumptions are made for convenience,

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,210
as they would allow us to simply work

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,890
with physical probabilities and ignore time value of money.

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,530
Next year, the economy can take one of the three states--

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,580
Good, Okay, or Bad.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,390
The probability of the good state is 1/6.

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,570
The probability of the Okay state is 1/3.

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,290
And the probability of the bad state is 1/2.

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,480
There is a hypothetical firm whose assets

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,460
will be worth $100 in the Good state, $50 in the Okay state,

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,460
and $20 in the Bad state.

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,480
The firm has outstanding debt with face value $50 due

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,980
in a year 1.

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,470
Management of the firm has identified a new project,

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,400
which requires an investment of $6 in year 0,

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,960
and pays off $10 in year one with certainty.

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,340
Management understands that this project has positive NPV of $4,

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,060
and therefore, should be taken, but does not have cash

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,920
available to finance this project.

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,910
Therefore, it considers raising external financing

29
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,470
to fund this project.

30
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,200
There are three available financing options.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,420
Option 1 is to raise new debt junior to existing debt.

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,910
Option 2 is to raise new equity.

33
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,040
And option 3 is to raise new debt, senior to existing debt.

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,750
You're hired as a financial advisor

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,700
to the management of the firm.

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,890
Determine which of these three options are feasible,

37
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,340
and advise on the best financing option.

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,440
First, let's determine the current value

39
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,470
of debt and equity without the new project.

40
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,230
The following table shows values of debt and equity

41
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,780
in all three states in year 1.

42
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,870
Recall that the face value of debt is $50.

43
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,449
Therefore, in Good and Okay states,

44
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,330
the value of the firm's assets is high enough

45
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,210
to pay the full face value back.

46
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,020
In the bad state, however, the value of assets is only $20,

47
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,280
which is not enough to pay the full $50 back to debt holders.

48
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,730
In this case, the value of debt is $20.

49
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,432
Equity holders are worth $50 in the Good state,

50
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:31,890
which is computed as the difference

51
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,340
between the value of assets and the face value of the bond.

52
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,610
In the Okay state and in the Bad state, the equity is worth 0.

53
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,980
The current value of debt equals to the probability

54
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,970
of the Good state, which is 1/6, multiplied by the value of debt

55
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,670
in that state, which is 50, plus probability

56
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,510
of the Okay state, which is 1/3, multiplied by the value of debt

57
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,570
in that state, which is 50, plus probability of the Bad

58
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,200
state, which is 1/2, multiplied by the value of debt

59
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,210
in that state, which is 20.

60
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,550
This gives us $35.

61
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,058
The current value of equity equals

62
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:08,850
to the probability of the Good state, which

63
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,120
is 1/6, multiplied by the value of equity in the Good state,

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,070
which is 50.

65
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,460
The value of equity in the other two states is 0.

66
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,050
Hence, the current value of equity equals to $8.33.

67
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,670
Let's now consider the first financing option, junior debt.

68
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,020
Let's first find the face value of this new junior debt.

69
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,170
Suppose that the face value is x dollars, where x is less than

70
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,900
or equal than 10.

71
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,420
Recall that the project generates the value of $10.

72
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,660
And hence, the total value of assets in the year 1

73
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,800
will be $110 in the Good state, $60 in the Okay state,

74
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,410
and $30 in the Bad state.

75
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,610
The value of existing debt will be $50 in the Good state,

76
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,000
$50 in the Okay state, and $30 in the Bad state.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,850
Therefore, the payoff to junior debt holders

78
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,000
will be x in the Good and the Okay states,

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,490
and 0 in the Bad state.

80
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,040
In order to price this debt, recall that the project

81
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,710
requires $6 to finance.

82
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,010
Since all investors are risk neutral and the risk rate is 0,

83
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,440
$6 should equal to the expected payoff from the bond in year 1.

84
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,290
This gives us $12.

85
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,620
Recall that we assume that x should be less than 10.

86
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,580
If it's 12, the value of assets in year 1 in the Okay state

87
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,570
is not high enough to repay the full face value back.

88
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,460
Let's revisit this assumption and assume

89
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,230
that x is greater than 10.

90
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,740
Then the payoff to junior debt holders in the Good state

91
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,940
will be x.

92
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,070
In the Okay state, it will be 10.

93
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,610
And in the Bad state, it will remain 0.

94
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,610
This gives us the new pricing equation.

95
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,670
Solving this, we get $16.

96
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,130
Therefore, for junior debt holders,

97
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,250
to agree to fund this project, the face value of the bond

98
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,130
has to be $16.

99
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,500
With this face value of new junior debt,

100
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,950
the payoff to equity holders will be $44 in the Good state,

101
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,100
and $0 in the Okay and Bad states.

102
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,130
The value of equity in year 0 will be $7.33.

103
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,300
Therefore, equity holders will not

104
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,760
be in favor of this financing arrangement,

105
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,490
because it increases their value by $1--

106
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,250
from $8.33 to $7.33.

107
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:33,640
Let's now consider the second financing option, equity.

108
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,070
In this case, the value of equity in year one

109
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,060
is $60 in the Good state, $10 in the Okay state,

110
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,910
and $0 in the Bad state.

111
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,130
The value of equity in year 0 equals

112
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,350
to the negative $6 spent to finance

113
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,440
the project, plus the expected payoff in year 1,

114
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,880
which is 1/6 times 60 plus 1/3 times 10.

115
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,250
This gives us $7.33.

116
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,480
Therefore, equity holders will not

117
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,150
agree to finance this project, because doing

118
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,560
so decreases their value from $8.33 to $7.33,

119
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,745
effectively resulting in negative NPV of $1.

120
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,650


121
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,210
Finally, let's consider the last financing option, senior debt.

122
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,880
Senior debt will effectively be risk free,

123
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,210
because the value of assets in all three states of the world

124
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,050
is high enough to not default on the promised payment.

125
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,430
Therefore, senior debt will have face value of $6.

126
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,110
The payoff to existing debt holders

127
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,490
will be $50 in the Good state, $50 in the Okay state,

128
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,520
and $24 in the Bad state.

129
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,660
The pay off to equity holders will be $54 in the Good state,

130
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,330
$4 in the Okay state, and $0 in the Bad state.

131
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,850
The current value of equity under this financing

132
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,650
arrangement will be $10.33.

133
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:05,040
Equity holders would therefore want to finance this project,

134
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,540
because it increases their value from $8.33 to $10.33.

135
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,490
What about existing debt holders?

136
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,890
The current value under this financing arrangement

137
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,560
becomes $37.

138
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,020
Therefore, existing debt holders will also

139
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,100
be supportive of this plan.

140
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,800
Let's summarize our findings.

141
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,250
Financing this project with either junior debt or equity

142
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,530
isn't feasible, because it lowers the value

143
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,870
of current shareholders.

144
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,370
Since they're the decision makers in the firm,

145
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,340
they will decide not to take this project.

146
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,310
On the other hand, if the project

147
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,220
is financed with senior debt, both equity holders

148
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,380
and current debt holders benefit.

149
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,460
And hence, they'll be in favor of this project.

150
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,400
This explains why we often observe that existing debt

151
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,310
holders agree to subordinate themselves

152
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,240
to new tranches of debt, because in distress situations, when

153
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,000
a firm is plagued by debt overhang,

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,530
financing new positive NPV projects benefits existing debt

155
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,240
holders.

156
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,090
Finally, note that the positive NPV created

157
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,330
by the project, which is $4, is split

158
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,760
between the equity holders and current debt

159
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,500
holders, each of whom get $2.

160
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,000
