00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,670
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will learn how

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,130
to value interest tax shields.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,160
Boston Properties is a publicly traded real estate investment

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,250
trust, headquartered in Boston.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,400
Suppose that it has just issued a perpetual bond

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,680
with a $10 million face value.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,180
Suppose that BP will pay interest only on this debt.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,060
Assume that the tax rate is 25%.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,520
We will answer the following questions.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,190
If interest rate on this debt is 6%,

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,708
what is the annual interest tax shield?

12
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,750
What is the present value of interest tax shields

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,730
generated by this bond?

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,625
Suppose instead that the interest rate is 5%.

15
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,500
What is the present value of the interest tax

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,270
shields in this case?

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,230
Let's start by computing the annual interest tax shield.

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,710
Recall that interest tax shield is the tax rate multiplied

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,880
by the interest expense.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,100
Therefore, let us first find the annual interest expense.

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,910
It is simply the interest tax rate,

22
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,140
which is 6%, multiplied by the face value of the bond,

23
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,590
which is $10 million.

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,130
This gives us $600,000.

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,790
To compute interest tax shield, we multiply tax rate

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,710
by the interest expense.

27
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,150
25% times $600,000.

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,090
This gives us 150,000.

29
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,990
Therefore, annual interest tax shield generated by this bond

30
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,680
is $150,000.

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,560
Next, let's compute the present value of interest tax shields.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,480
Since this is a perpetual bond, it

33
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,260
generates $150,000 annual interest tax shield

34
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,030
in perpetuity.

35
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,110
Therefore, its present value is simply the annual tax shield

36
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,210
divided by the interest rate.

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,260
That is $150,000 divided by 6%.

38
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,010
This gives us $2.5 million.

39
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,490
Therefore, the present value of the tax shields generated

40
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,038
by this bond is $2.5 million.

41
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,330
What would be the present value of interest tax shields

42
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,330
if the interest rate was 5%?

43
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,180
Let's see how the present value of tax shields

44
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,730
depends on the interest rate.

45
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,610
Present value of tax shields is the annual tax rate tau

46
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,610
times interest divided by R, because in this case,

47
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,710
tax shields are perpetual.

48
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,860
Since interest expense is interest rate times the face

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,010
value of the bond, we get tau times R

50
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,310
times face value divided by R.

51
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,800
We see that R cancels out.

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,690
And the present value of tax shields

53
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,740
is simply tax rate times the face value of the bond.

54
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,230
Hence, the present value of tax shields

55
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,320
generated by perpetual bonds does not

56
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,660
depend on interest rate.

57
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,914
In our case, the present value is still $2.5 million.

58
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:53,280
Now, suppose that instead of issuing a perpetual bond,

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,140
Boston Properties has issued a $10 million

60
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,710
face value bond with a maturity of 15 years.

61
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,310
Assume that the bond pays an annual coupon rate of 5%

62
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,678
and that the bond has been issued at par.

63
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,720
What is the present value of interest tax shields

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,420
generated by this bond?

65
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,740
The annual interest tax shield, in this case, is $125,000.

66
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,280
These tax shields represent a 15 year

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
annuity and its present value is the annual tax

68
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,190
shield divided by R multiplied by the 15 year annuity factor.

69
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,350
Plugging in the interest rate of 5%,

70
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,410
we find that the present value of tax shields in this case

71
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,305
is $1.3 million.

72
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:36,900
Notice that this value is roughly half

73
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,360
of the value of tax shields generated

74
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,330
by the perpetual bond.

75
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,720
Note that in situations when bonds have finite term,

76
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,540
the present value of tax shields does depend

77
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,710
on the value of interest rate.

78
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,400
For example, if the interest rate was 6%,

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,530
the value of tax shields in this case

80
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,500
would have increased to $1.46 million.

81
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,000
