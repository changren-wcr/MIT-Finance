00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will demonstrate how

1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,820
to value firms that are financed with both equity

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,350
and debt in situations when firms are subject to taxation.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,560
Equity Residential, which is a publicly traded real estate

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,379
investment trust that invests in apartments,

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,260
is considering opening a new mixed-use property

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,090
in Kendall Square.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,730
The property is expected to start generating cash

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,320
flow in year one.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,560
The first cash flow is expected to be $55 million,

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,369
and this amount will grow at a rate of 2% per year

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,060
from then on.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,290
Assume that Equity Residential pays out all of its earnings

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,910
to shareholders as dividends.

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,470
We will also assume that shareholders

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,450
pay no taxes on dividends.

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,350
Suppose that the cost of capital for this property is 20%.

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,780
Equity Residential faces a corporate tax rate of 25%.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,120
In part a, we will assume that the property will

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,350
be financed with 100% equity.

20
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,470
And we will find its current market value

21
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,240
under this assumption.

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,030
In part b, we will assume that Equity Residential

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,310
is considering to borrow $200 million

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,310
to finance this property development.

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,650
This financing will either take a form

26
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,020
of a perpetual bond or a rolling term loan, in which case

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,890
the company will be re-borrowing the same principal amount

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,250
of maturity to cover the principal payment.

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,530
In either of these two cases, Equity Residential

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,140
is expected to pay only interest payments each year.

31
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,760
Suppose that the annual interest rate will be 10%.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,310
Also assume, for simplicity, that this interest rate

33
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,808
will not change.

34
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:35,850
What is the current market value of this property

35
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,910
under this financing arrangement?

36
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,100
Let's first find the market value of this property

37
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,580
if it is 100% equity financed.

38
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,584
The after-tax cash flow in year one will be $41.25 million.

39
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:53,340
The first year cash flow will grow in perpetuity

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,410
at a 2% rate.

41
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,170
Given the discount rate of 20%, this

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,600
implies that the current market value of this property

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,500
is $229.17 million.

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,920
Next, let's find the value of this property

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,310
if it is financed with $200 million perpetual loan

46
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,580
with an interest rate of 10%.

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,590
When firms are subject to taxation,

48
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,240
the Modigliani-Miller result that

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,370
demonstrates that capital structure does not

50
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,010
affect firm value no longer holds

51
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,730
because debt creates valuable interest tax shields.

52
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,450
The value of the firm with debt, which we call levered firm,

53
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,610
equals to the value of the unlevered firm

54
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,510
plus the present value of interest tax shields.

55
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,180
We have already found the value of the unlevered firm

56
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,920
in part a.

57
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,620
Therefore, to find the value of the levered firm,

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,810
we need to find the present value of interest tax

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,620
shields generated by this loan.

60
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,040
The annual interest on this loan is 10% times $200 million,

61
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,015
which equals to $20 million.

62
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:59,310
The annual interest tax shield equals

63
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,060
to the tax rate, which is 25% times the interest, which

64
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,530
is $20 million.

65
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,770
This gives us $5 million.

66
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,610
This loan generates $5 million annual interest tax shields

67
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,380
in perpetuity.

68
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,040
Therefore, the present value is simply the annual tax shield

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,870
divided by the interest rate.

70
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,240
That is $5 million divided by 10%.

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,852
This gives us $50 million.

72
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:27,780
Combining the unlevered value with the present value

73
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,300
of interest tax shields, we obtain the levered value

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,590
of this property.

75
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,160
It is $279.17 million.

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,200
Let's also find the current value of equity.

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,050
It equals to the levered firm value minus the value of debt.

78
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,410
That is $279.17 million minus $200 million,

79
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,375
which gives us $79.17 million.

80
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,460
Given the current values of equity and debt,

81
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,295
we can find the current debt-to-equity ratio.

82
00:03:56,295 --> 00:04:00,910
It equals to $200 million divided by $79.17 million,

83
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,810
which equals to 2.53.

84
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,300
Let's answer another question.

85
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,250
What would be the debt-to-equity ratio

86
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,460
of this property in year 10?

87
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,190
To find it, we need to find the values of debt and equity

88
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,220
in year 10.

89
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,670
First, because the loan is perpetual or being rolled over

90
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,620
indefinitely, its value will remain $200 million forever.

91
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,082
Second, since cash flows grow in perpetuity,

92
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:29,540
this means that the firm value will

93
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,060
grow in perpetuity as well.

94
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,070
And since debt remains constant, it

95
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,340
implies that equity value will be growing over time.

96
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,840
Let's first find the value of the unlevered firm in the year

97
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,040
10.

98
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,650
It equals to the after-tax cash flow in the year 11

99
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,330
divided by r minus g.

100
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,100
Cash flow in year 11 can be found

101
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,680
as the cash flow in year one times

102
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,070
1 plus g raised to the power of 10.

103
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:01,028
This gives us the unlevered firm value of $279.35 million.

104
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:03,710
To find levered firm value in year 10,

105
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,660
we're adding to the unlevered value

106
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,450
the value of tax shields in the year 10.

107
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,730
That is all tax shields that will

108
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,240
accrue from year 11 onwards.

109
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
Since debt is perpetual, this value equals to $50 million,

110
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,410
the same value as the present value of tax shields.

111
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:28,900
This gives us the total firm value of $329.35 million.

112
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,040
Knowing the firm value, we can find equity value

113
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,560
by subtracting the value of debt.

114
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,420
It's $329.35 million minus $200 million.

115
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,111
This equals to $129.35 million.

116
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,200
Knowing the values of debt and equity,

117
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,510
we can finally find the debt-to-equity ratio

118
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,520
in the year 10.

119
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,310
It equals to 1.55.

120
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,260
Recall that in year 10, this ratio was 2.53.

121
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,400
This decline is attributed to the growing value of equity.

122
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,100
Since debt remains constant in perpetuity

123
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,400
and the firm value grows at 2% in perpetuity,

124
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,100
the debt-to-equity ratio will eventually converge to 0.

125
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,000
