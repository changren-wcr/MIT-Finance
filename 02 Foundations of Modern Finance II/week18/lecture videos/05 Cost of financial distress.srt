00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020


1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,240
PROFESSOR: Let's continue with the example.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,060
How can a firm overcome the debt overhang problem exposed?

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,340
That is, when already approaching financial distress.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,740
There are at least two possible measures.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,780
The first is to issue new debt to fund the project,

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,720
as equity holders won't fund it.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,340
But how?

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,920
Should we use junior or senior debt?

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,640
The second approach is financial restructuring.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,680
This could be outside bankruptcy or workout

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,610
under a formal bankruptcy procedure.

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,030
Let's consider issuing new debt to fund the project.

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,660
This solution faces the following challenges.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,070
First, if new debt has lower seniority than existing debt,

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,900
it won't improve the situation.

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,370
The tax on equity holders for new project is unchanged.

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,960
Second, if new debt has the same seniority as the existing debt,

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,680
you will mitigate but may not overcome the debt overhang

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,030
problem.

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,410
Third, if new debt has higher seniority than the existing

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,800
debt, you will further reduce the tax

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,650
on equity holders for the new investment

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,980
by giving them a larger share of its payoff.

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,920
Another alternative is to issue debt

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,880
with shorter maturity than the existing debt, which

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,370
is de facto more senior.

27
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,740
But issuing more senior debt is often

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,930
prohibited by the covenants of the existing debt.

29
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,980
Let's consider these scenarios in more detail.

30
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,190
We'll start with the case of issuing junior debt

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,780
to fund the project.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,238
All payoffs and values are in million dollars.

33
00:01:57,238 --> 00:02:01,730
Since the existing asset has only idiosyncratic risk,

34
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,060
and the new project is risk-free,

35
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,760
the discount rate for both is the risk-free rate,

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,470
which is zero.

37
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,660
Therefore, the current market value

38
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,440
for any payoff in year one is simply its expected payoff.

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,040
We will always use this to price debt and equity

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,150
in the different situations we consider below.

41
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,550
Existing debt has a face value of 40 due next year.

42
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,130
Without the project, existing debt

43
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,030
has a current market value of 25.

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,050
As said above, it simply equals its expected payoff

45
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,830
in year one, which is 1/2 times 40 in the good state

46
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,410
plus 10 in the bad state, which gives 25.

47
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,460
Equity you value is then 1/2 times 60 in a good state

48
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,460
plus 0 in a bad state, which gives 30.

49
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,570
With the new project, the total payoff from the firm's

50
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,020
assets is given in the third column in the table--

51
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,850
120 in the good state and 30 in the bad state.

52
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,730
Suppose the firm issues new junior debt

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,172
to raise $15 million.

54
00:03:19,172 --> 00:03:22,170
Since in the bad state there's not enough money

55
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,640
to pay the existing debtholders, the new junior debt

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,010
will receive nothing.

57
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,000
This then implies that its payoff in the good state

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,900
must be 30 in order to justify the current value of 15.

59
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,020
The fourth column in the table gives the payoff

60
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,830
to the old debtholders with the project,

61
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,400
40 and 30 in the two states.

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,240
The current value of the old debt is now 1/2 times

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,810
40 plus 30, which is 35.

64
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,950
The fifth column gives the payoff to the new debtholders--

65
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,100
30 in a good state and zero in a bad state.

66
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,440
Its current market value is indeed

67
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,200
15, the average of 30 and zero.

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,370
The last column is the payoff to the equity holders,

69
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,769
50 in a good state and zero in a bad state.

70
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,500
In this case, the value of the existing debt increases to 35.

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,350
It is 25 without the project.

72
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,316
The new junior debtholders break even.

73
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:39,790
The NPV for the equity holders is given by the value of equity

74
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,400
with the project, which is 1/2 times

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,230
50 plus 1/2 times 0, that is 25 minus 30,

76
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,080
the equity value without the project.

77
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,420
This gives minus 5.

78
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,710
Therefore, the equity holders won't take the project.

79
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,950
We now consider the case of issuing new debt

80
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,760
with the same seniority as the existing debt.

81
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,830
The existing debt still has a face value of 40 due next year.

82
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,400
Without the project, the value of the debt and equity

83
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,920
is the same as before, 25 and 30, respectively.

84
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,490
With the new project, the payoff from the asset

85
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,210
is the same as before, given by the third column in the table,

86
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,520
120 and 30 in the good and bad states, respectively.

87
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,930
We issue new debt with the same seniority as the existing debt

88
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,960
to fund the project.

89
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,560
We have the following conditions.

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,430
First, we need to raise $15 million.

91
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,190
Therefore, the current market value of the new debt

92
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:56,770
should be 15, which equals its expected payoff in year one,

93
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,820
since the discount rate is 0.

94
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,060
In the good state, both the old debt and the new debt

95
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,620
will be paid in full at their face values.

96
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,370
In the bad state, however, default occurs.

97
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,310
With the same seniority, the old and new debt

98
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,840
will be splitting the value of the asset on the pro-rata basis

99
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,560
according to their face values.

100
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,290
The above imply that the new debt's face value should be 20.

101
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,920
The payoff of old debt is given by the fourth column

102
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,540
in the table, 40 in a good state and 20 in a bad state.

103
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,980
Note that in the bad state the old debt shares the asset value

104
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,150
with the new debt, in proportion to the offense values.

105
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,660
This gives a weight of 2/3 for the old debt

106
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,210
and 1/3 for the new debt.

107
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,530
Given that the total asset value is 30 in the bad state,

108
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,990
the payoff to the old debtholders

109
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,710
is 2/3 times 30, which is 20.

110
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,710
The payoff to the new debt is then 10.

111
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,370
The market value of the old debt with the project

112
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,610
is now 1/2 times 40 plus 20.

113
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,160
That gives 30.

114
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,490
The payoff to the new debt with the same seniority

115
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,390
as the old debt is given by the fifth column.

116
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,290
It is 20 in a good state and 10 in a bad state.

117
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,280
As stated above, for the new debt we have its face value

118
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,670
is 20, which is paid in full in a good state.

119
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,820
In a bad state, it shares the asset value of 30

120
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,450
with the old debt in proportion to their face values,

121
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,240
which gives 10.

122
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,810
The market value of the new debt is 1/2 times 20 plus 10.

123
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,740
That gives 15, which is the amount needed

124
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,210
for the new project.

125
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,930
The payoff to equity is then given

126
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,680
in the last column in the table, which is 60 in a good state

127
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,400
and 0 in a bad state.

128
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,720
Its current market value is then 1/2 times 60 plus 0.

129
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,720
That gives 30, same as without the project.

130
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,420
From the above analysis, we conclude

131
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,680
that by taking the project, the value of existing debt

132
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,251
increases from 25 to 30 with a net gain of $5 million.

133
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:28,080
The new debtholders break even.

134
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,980
For the equity holders, the NPV from taking the project

135
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,760
is 1/2 times 60 plus 1/2 times 0 divided by 1

136
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,179
plus 0 minus 30, which gives 0.

137
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,340
That is they are indifferent.

138
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,700
Clearly, in this case, equity holders

139
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,390
have avoided any loss by taking the project.

140
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,830
But all the gain still go to the existing debtholders.

141
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,280
Next, we consider the case of issuing new debt

142
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,610
with higher seniority than the existing debt.

143
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,720
The starting point is the same as before in terms of the face

144
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,440
value of the existing debt and the market value of debt

145
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,750
and equity without the project.

146
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,940
As before, with the new project, the asset value in both states

147
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,730
are given by the third column in the table.

148
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,360
120 in a good state and 30 in a bad state.

149
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,830
If we issue new debt with higher seniority to raise $15 million

150
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:37,520
for the project, it's face value only need to be 15.

151
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,130
This is because with the new project,

152
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:45,390
the total asset value exceeds 15 in both states.

153
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,960
Therefore, the new debt will always be paid in full

154
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,850
and becomes risk-free, as shown by the table's fifth column.

155
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,480
Its current market value will be 15, exactly what's needed.

156
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,390
The fourth column of the table shows the payoff

157
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,070
to the old debtholders.

158
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,970
In a good state, it's 40, its face value.

159
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,520
In a bad state, it is the value of the asset,

160
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,090
which is 30 minus the payoff to the senior debt, which is 15.

161
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,500
And that leaves 15.

162
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,230
The value of the debt now becomes 1/2 times 40 plus 15,

163
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,870
and that equals 27.5.

164
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,930
The last column in the table gives the payoff

165
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,360
to the equity holders.

166
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,990
65 in a good state and zero in a bad state.

167
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,190
The NPV for the shareholders, then, from taking the project

168
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,090
is 32.5 minus 30.

169
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,760
That is plus $2.5 million.

170
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,570
Clearly, in this case, the equity holders

171
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,020
will be willing to take the project.

172
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,370
But the challenge is that the covenants of the existing debt

173
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,200
typically prohibits the issuing of more senior debt.

174
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,390
Will the existing debtholders agree to break the covenants?

175
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,290
Effectively, this will require a restructuring of the existing

176
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,970
debt.

177
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:23,540
In principle, restructuring can help to avoid inefficiency.

178
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,610
It often involves debt for equity exchange and/or debt

179
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,300
rescheduling and restructuring.

180
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,750
The basic idea is as follows.

181
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,900
Offer to give debtholders equity in return

182
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,930
for canceling the existing debt.

183
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,690
Debtholders then become equity holders

184
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,730
and will have aligned interests.

185
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,230
Once debt is reduced, it also reduces its tax

186
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,020
on new investments.

187
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,610
Another way to look at this is that to overcome debt overhang,

188
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,930
we need to cut debt.

189
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,250
The underlying mechanism is to convince existing debtholders

190
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,380
to accept past losses in exchange for a share in gains

191
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,180
from new investments.

192
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,510
The discussion above focuses on the problems

193
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,220
of financial distress exposed.

194
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,430
Foreseeing these problems, firms and the market

195
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:30,950
take measures ex ante to reduce the potential inefficiencies

196
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,840
caused by financial distress.

197
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,240
Here are some simple examples.

198
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,360
Firms expecting large funding needs

199
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,260
should avoid too much debt.

200
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,800
Firms anticipating valuable investment opportunities

201
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,870
should avoid too much debt.

202
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,030
If leverage cannot be avoided, structure liabilities to allow

203
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,920
easy restructuring where needed, such as actively managing

204
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,360
liabilities, using bank debt rather than bonds,

205
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,040
which have diverse investors, dealing with fewer banks rather

206
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,830
than many.
