00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,420
PROFESSOR: Investors or debt and equity holders

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,750
care only about after-tax cash flows.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,470
Taxes will influence a firm's after-tax cash flow

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,770
to its investors and, consequently,

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,060
its choices in investment and financing.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,090
In particular, different financial transactions

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,280
and payouts are taxed differently.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,910
For example, interest payments are

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,430
tax-exempt at the firm level.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,950
It is treated as an expense.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,110
Dividends and retained earnings are not.

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,530
Under such a tax system, financing clearly

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,160
matters, because it will affect a firm's tax

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,180
bill and its after-tax payoffs.

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,650
It's also worth noting that tax code varies substantially

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,480
across countries.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,810
In our discussion, we follow the US tax system

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,080
only for convenience and illustration.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,550
The methodology we developed, however,

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,810
can be applied to other tax systems.

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,960
We will start by focusing on corporate taxes

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,660
first, assuming no personal taxes.

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,700
This is true for many institutional investors,

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,420
such as pension funds, charities,

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,330
and tax-exempt foundations.

26
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,720
We will return to the impact of personal taxes

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,370
at the end of this lecture.

28
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,650
When interest payments are treated

29
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,390
as a firm's expense and as tax-exempt,

30
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,770
then increasing debt can increase firm value

31
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,140
by reducing its tax burden.

32
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,620
We illustrate this point by considering an example.

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:53,070
XYZ Inc generates a safe annual income of $100 million

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,890
perpetually.

35
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,750
The discount rate, which should be the risk-free rate, is 10%.

36
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,320
XYZ faces a corporate tax rate of 35%.

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,350
Let's now consider two alternative ways

38
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,140
the firm can be financed.

39
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,800
The first is 100% debt financing.

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,910
XYZ then pays out all its income of $100 million as interest.

41
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,530
The second way is 100% equity financing.

42
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,490
The firm then pays out $100 million

43
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,590
as dividends or capital gains.

44
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,990
The table on the slide shows XYZ's pre and after-tax cash

45
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,070
flows and their valuations.

46
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,490
The second column describes the firm's cash flows

47
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,880
with 100% debt financing.

48
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,310
The second row gives the pre-tax cash

49
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,980
flow, which is $100 million.

50
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,960
This also equals the total interest payment.

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,570
The third row gives the tax the firm has to pay.

52
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,560
Since after the interest payment the firm has no income

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,050
to report, it pays zero taxes.

54
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,860
For the firm's investors-- in this case, it's debt holders--

55
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,460
the after-tax income is $100 million.

56
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,090
The firm's value, which is simply

57
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,580
the value of its debt in this case,

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,390
is 100 divided by 10%, the discount

59
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,375
rate, which equals $1 billion.

60
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:37,120
The third column in the table gives the firm's cash flows

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,940
under 100% equity financing.

62
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,830
The second row gives the pre-tax cash

63
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,780
flow, which is $100 million, same as before.

64
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,780
The third row is the tax.

65
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,790
With an income of $100 million and a tax rate of 35%,

66
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,790
the tax bill will be $35 million.

67
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,430
For the firm's investors-- in this case, its equity holders--

68
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,000
the after-tax income is 100 minus 35,

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,650
which equals $65 million.

70
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,870
The firm's value, which is the value

71
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,800
of its equity in this case, is 65,

72
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,940
which is the annual cash flow divided by the discount rate,

73
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,050
again, 10%.

74
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,360
That gives us $650 million.

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,132


76
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:30,090
Comparing the two financing choices,

77
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,630
it is obvious that debt financing dominates,

78
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,760
because it avoids taxes and increases the after-tax cash

79
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,890
flow to the firm's investors.

80
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,510
In the above analysis, we assume that both debt and equity

81
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,510
holders pay no personal taxes.

82
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,490
It should be clear from the analysis,

83
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,050
however, that personal taxes can change the results, which

84
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,900
we will return to later.

85
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,990
Expanding on what we have learned from the example,

86
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,940
we can extend the MM framework to include corporate taxes.

87
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,690
First, the starting point of MM still holds.

88
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,550
That is the pie before tax remains unaffected by capital

89
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,240
structure.

90
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,380
It is fully determined by the firm's asset or its cash flow.

91
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,760
In other words, the size of the pie before tax

92
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,720
equals the present value of pre-tax cash flow.

93
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,110
But the tax authority, the IRS in the US,

94
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,590
takes a slice before investors.

95
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,000
Financing policy affects the size of that slice.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,540
In particular, since interest payments are tax deductible,

97
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:53,250
the slice of IRS can be reduced by using more debt.

98
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,310
Consequently, the after-tax value of the firm

99
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,290
depends on its capital structure.

100
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,310
This idea can be clearly illustrated

101
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,250
by the so-called Pie Theory as shown

102
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,070
in the plot on this slide.

103
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,110
The total size of the pie is given

104
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,760
by the present value of the firm's pre-tax cash flow.

105
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,380
It is fixed given the firm's asset.

106
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,790
This pie will then be sliced into three pieces--

107
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,610
the present value of its tax liability,

108
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,150
the present value of debt, D, and the present value

109
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,160
of equity, E. Conservation of cash or value

110
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,850
gives the present value of pre-tax cash flow

111
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,910
equals the present value of tax plus D plus E.

112
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,390
The left hand side, which is the total size of the pie,

113
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,010
is fixed.

114
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,700
Increasing D will then decrease the tax bill

115
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,540
or the present value of tax.

116
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,940
And it has increased the total value

117
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,820
of the firm, which is D plus E. Therefore,

118
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,710
the value of the firm after tax can be increased by increasing

119
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,160
debt, which reduces taxes.

120
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,280
We now formally incorporate the impact

121
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,940
of corporate taxes into the MM framework.

122
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,070
Let's consider two firms--

123
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,770
U and L-- with identical assets.

124
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,510
The asset yields an expected pre-tax cash flow of X

125
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,310
next year and nothing afterwards.

126
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,160
The required rate of return on the asset is rA.

127
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,550
Firm U is 100% equity financed.

128
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,770
That is its unlevered.

129
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,990
Firm L has that level D, which pays an expected interest

130
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,180
rate of rD plus the principal next year.

131
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,000
The corporate tax rate is tau.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,790
Let's ignore personal taxes at this point.

133
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,870
We can now write down the after-tax cash flow

134
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,200
for the two firms in year one.

135
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,810
For Firm U, the after-tax cash flow

136
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:17,310
is simply 1 minus tau times X. For Firm L,

137
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,260
the after-tax cash flow is 1 minus tau times X,

138
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,980
the pre-tax cash flow, minus interest payment, which is rD,

139
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:33,059
times D plus rD times D. That gives us 1 minus tau times X

140
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,820
plus tau times rD times D.

141
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,179
The last term in the equation is the tax shield

142
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,860
from debt, which is simply the tax rate times the interest

143
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,970
payment.

144
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,740
We then have the value for each firm as follows.

145
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,320
The value of the unlevered firm, VU,

146
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,980
equals 1 minus tau times X, the after-tax cash

147
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,330
flow, divided by 1 plus the discount rate, rA.

148
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,940
The value of the levered firm, VL,

149
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,500
equals 1 minus tau times X divided by 1

150
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,260
plus rA plus tau times rD times D,

151
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,710
the tax shield, divided by 1 plus rD.

152
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:28,530
Rewriting that, we have VL equals VU plus tau

153
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,180
times rD times D divided by 1 plus rD.

154
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,110
Here the discount rate for X is rA.

155
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,570
And the discount rate for the tax shield,

156
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,540
which is tau times rD times D, is

157
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,190
rD, same as the expected interest rate on debt,

158
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,360
because they have the same risk.

159
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,130
We summarize the above result as MM Theorem One

160
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,660
with corporate taxes.

161
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,720
The value of a levered firm equals

162
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,350
the value of the unlevered firm with the same asset

163
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,490
plus the present value of the tax shield from debt.

164
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,400
That is VL equals VU plus the present value of the tax

165
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,770
shield.

166
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,510
And, sometimes, we write it as VU plus PVTS, the present value

167
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,760
of tax shield.

168
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,740
As we have seen from the previous example,

169
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,510
the tax shield of debt matters for firm value,

170
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,090
potentially, substantially.

171
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,840
The MM Theorem or the Pie Theory leads us

172
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,020
to the right question and the right answer.

173
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,020
In this case, it allows us to find out

174
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:48,170
how financing choices can affect the IRS bite of the total pie

175
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,310
and how to minimize it or maximize the remaining

176
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,170
part of the pie.

177
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,780
There are, however, some caveats to keep in mind.

178
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,210
First, not all firms face full marginal corporate tax rate.

179
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,810
Some companies pay no or very low taxes.

180
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,010
For them, the value of tax shield can be limited.

181
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:15,370
Second, personal taxes can change the results above.

182
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,300
The analysis above leads to valuable implications.

183
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,050
First, raising debt by itself does not create value.

184
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,120
In other words, a firm cannot create value by issuing debt

185
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,590
and then sitting on the cash.

186
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,820
Second, using debt creates value relative to raising

187
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,420
the same amount of funds using equity.

188
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,660
Next, value can be created by generating a tax shield when

189
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,260
either financing an asset or investment with debt

190
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,930
rather than equity or undertake a recapitalisation, that is

191
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,720
retire some equity with debt.

192
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,960
Moreover, the tax advantage of debt can be large.

193
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,710
However, when personal taxes are present,

194
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,530
the tax advantage of debt is reduced

195
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,720
for individual investors.

196
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,780
It becomes smaller when investors are mostly

197
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,070
individuals.

198
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,580
Our next question is then if debt adds value,

199
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,930
why don't firms simply lever up?
