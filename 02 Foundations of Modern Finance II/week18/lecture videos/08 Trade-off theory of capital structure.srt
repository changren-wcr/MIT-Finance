00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,330
PROFESSOR: As the previous example demonstrates,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,720
a key in determining the optimal capital structure

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,470
is the present value of distress cost.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,470
We have also learned that two major factors

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,920
are effecting the present value of distress cost.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,460
The first factor is the probability of distress.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,480
More precisely, the risk neutral probability.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,680
This depends on the volatility of the firm's cash flows.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,100
Volatile cash flows arise for various reasons,

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,200
such as industry change, technology change,

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,200
cyclical industry, macro shocks, start-ups, and so on.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,170
The second factor is the cost arising from distress.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,820
These costs can be large in the following situations.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,110
When there's a lot of need for external funds for CAPX

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,190
or market share, financially strong competitors,

16
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,930
customers and suppliers care about your financial position.

17
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,280
Summarizing our analysis in the trade-off theory of capital

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,490
structure, we have the following checklist when

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,880
considering financial choices.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,820
First is taxes.

21
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,240
Does the firm benefit from debt tax shield?

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,560
The second is the present value of distress costs.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,490
Relevant factors include cash flow volatility,

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,590
need for external funding for investments, competitive threat

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,280
under financial distress, customers and suppliers

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,010
sensitive about distress.

27
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,770
Beyond the qualitative conclusions

28
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,920
we can draw from our analysis, how

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,530
about quantitative predictions?

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,410
Can a theory give us the right number for leverage?

31
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,210
The answer is less clear cut.

32
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,900
First, there's no one size fits all formula.

33
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,040
Second, the key is to understand the factors affecting

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,110
capital structure decisions.

35
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,960
Third, in actual decisions, one need

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,430
to apply business and financial judgment, taking into account

37
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,310
the factors listed above.

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,780
In particular, the best we can do in deciding on leverage

39
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,280
will be ranges, not point values.

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,170
After all, as the value of the firm's asset changes over time,

41
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,170
its leverage will also fluctuate.

42
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,820
There's no point to pin it down to a single number.

43
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,960
With the simple theory above, what

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,500
can we explain in terms of what firms do?

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,070
It is good at helping us understand the capital

46
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,750
structure or leverage differences at broad levels.

47
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,960
For example, debt ratio of 43.2% for electric and gas

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,660
versus 3.5% for computer software.

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,260
Industries with more volatile cash flows, in general,

50
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,350
have lower than leverage.

51
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,160
The theory is not very good at explaining small differences

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,650
in debt ratios, such as 22.9% for food production

53
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,290
versus 9.1% for manufacturing equipment.

54
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,840
It's also not so good at explaining

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,300
short-term fluctuations in debt ratio.

56
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,820
Other factors are also important.

57
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,860
We will return to some of them in the following lectures.
