00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,610
PROFESSOR: In our discussion on capital structure

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,470
in the previous lecture, we have established the MM result.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,320
That is, in absence of imperfections

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,900
in the financial market, a firm's value

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,930
does not depend on its capital structure.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,020
A major interpretation of MM's insight

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,820
is that capital structure may matter if there are frictions.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,440
In this lecture, we are going to extend the basic MM framework

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,270
by relaxing its assumptions.

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,000
In particular, by introducing market

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,190
frictions into our analysis.

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,690
We proceed in two steps.

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,450
In the first step, which is this lecture,

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,010
we introduce two of the most basic frictions.

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,660
The first is taxes, which will occur at two levels.

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,720
At the corporate level and also at the personal level.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,900
As we will see, taxes at both levels

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,250
can have major impacts on the firm's financing choices.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,670
The second is the cost of financial distress.

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,840
When the firm takes on debt it may face financial distress

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,240
when default risk becomes substantial.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,540
This situation can bring non-trivial costs

23
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,040
to debt financing.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,890
In the second step, we briefly consider

25
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,150
several other frictions in later lectures.

26
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,020
Which include transaction costs for issuing debt and equity,

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,800
asymmetric information about the firm's investments,

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,830
capital structure may influence managers investment decisions.
