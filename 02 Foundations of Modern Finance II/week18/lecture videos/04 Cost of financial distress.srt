1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,790
PROFESSOR: Let us now examine, in more detail,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,030
the costs of financial distress.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,560
We roughly divide the costs into two categories--

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,630
direct costs and indirect costs.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,550
Direct costs of financial distress

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,440
include legal costs, time spent on dealing with distress,

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,540
and so on.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,790
Indirect costs include scare off customers and suppliers,

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,260
agency costs--

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,750
that is, the divergence in the interests

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,630
of managers and shareholders--

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,240
debt overhang, which means difficulty

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,010
in raising funds to take on good investments, which

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,240
may lead to passing up valuable projects,

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,180
competitors become more aggressive,

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,510
taking on bad risks, and so on.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,560
We will consider each of these costs.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,120
We first consider that direct costs of financial distress,

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,550
or bankruptcy.

20
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,100
They include the following items--

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,470
legal expenses, court costs, advisory fees, and then

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,020
opportunity costs, like distractions

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,130
from dealing with creditors.

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,030
The next question is, how important these costs are?

25
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,560
It is hard to come up with precise estimates for them,

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,680
but we have the following rough ranges.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,210
The direct cost of bankruptcy is about two to five percent

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,480
of the total firm value for large companies,

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,420
and up to 20% to 25% for small companies.

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,250
But we have to weigh this cost by the bankruptcy probability.

31
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,910
Overall, the expected direct cost of bankruptcy

32
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,010
tends to be fairly small, even for a bankruptcy cost

33
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,700
of 20%, which is sort of the case for small companies.

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,270
With a bankruptcy probability of 10%, which is high

35
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,509
based on historic data we have seen earlier,

36
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,450
the expected bankruptcy cost is only 2%.

37
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,040


38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,380
There are, however, two caveats we want to add.

39
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,150
First, the bankruptcy cost can be large for some firms.

40
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,210
Second, the present value of bankruptcy costs

41
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,890
should be expected value, using risk-neutral probabilities, not

42
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,200
physical probabilities.

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,880
We now consider the indirect costs of financial distress.

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,820
The first type of indirect cost comes

45
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,340
from losing customers and suppliers.

46
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,240
For example, suppliers may demand cash payments now.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,470
This can put the firm into financial distress.

48
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,240
Customers may leave.

49
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,410
Why is this true?

50
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,190
That's because the relationship can be longer term.

51
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,090
What types of firms are more susceptible to this problem?

52
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,610
General Motors or Market Basket?

53
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,010
Market Basket is a retail store for groceries.

54
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,530
There, the relationship between the firm and its customers

55
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,540
are pretty much short term.

56
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,080
Where for General Motors, when you buy a car from GM,

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,720
the relationship is longer term.

58
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,290
You may have to go back for repairs and parts.

59
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,660
The second type of indirect cost is agency cost.

60
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,600
Financial distress may cause managers

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,300
to take on actions that are not in the best

62
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,000
interest of shareholders.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,100
We can think of many examples, such as cash-in-and-run,

64
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,920
which is to divert resources out of the firm,

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,630
excess risk-taking--

66
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,020
gambling for resurrection-- delay

67
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,390
of efficient resolution, or liquidation.

68
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,800
Why are these possibilities costly to the shareholders,

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,230
given the fact that, in bankruptcy, they

70
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,970
are out anyway?

71
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,140
This is because debt holders anticipate them, and will

72
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,760
pay less for the debt when it's issued.

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,079
In order to reduce the cost of these possibilities,

74
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,980
the stock and bond holders do take preemptive measures,

75
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,220
such as covenants in the debt contract,

76
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,620
and having collateral.

77
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,110
We will have more discussion on covenants later.

78
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,200
The third type of indirect cost for financial distress

79
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,420
is debt overhang.

80
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,230
This is about how debt issued before becomes

81
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,430
too much of a burden on the firm,

82
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,950
so that it will distort its decisions.

83
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:57,340
We illustrate the effect of debt overhang through an example.

84
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,260
Let's assume Company XYZ's assets in place is risky,

85
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,730
but the risk is idiosyncratic.

86
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,370
Next year, the assets' value is given

87
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,570
by the table on the slide.

88
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,530
There are two possible states next year, good and bad,

89
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,020
given in the first column.

90
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,540
The probabilities are both half, given in the second column.

91
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,770
The third column gives the value of XYZ's asset--

92
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,320
100 in the good state, and 10 in the bad state, all

93
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,890
in million dollars.

94
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:41,280
For simplicity, we assume that the risk-free rate is zero.

95
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,150
XYZ now has a new investment opportunity

96
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,580
with the following data.

97
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,580
It requires an initial investment of $15 million

98
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,820
today.

99
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,710
It yields a safe payoff of $20 million next year.

100
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,030
At the risk-free rate of zero, the NPV of this project

101
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,210
is minus 15, the initial investment,

102
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,930
plus 20, the payoff next year, discounted

103
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,390
at a discount rate of zero.

104
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,970
That gives us plus $5 million.

105
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,220
Therefore XYZ should take this project.

106
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,630
Suppose that XYZ has an outstanding debt of $40 million

107
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,720
in face value, including interest,

108
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,370
which is due next year.

109
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,040
Since the firm's asset value is $10 million

110
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,460
in the bad state, which is below $40 million,

111
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,040
the debt is risky and will default in the bad state.

112
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:50,020
Let's now consider how the firm may decide on the new project.

113
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,320
The first table on the slide shows the payoff

114
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,350
to the debt and equity holders in the two states

115
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,790
without the project.

116
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,760
As before, the third column gives the payoff

117
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,650
from the firm's asset in good and bad states, respectively.

118
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,910
The fourth column gives the payoff to debt holders.

119
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,700
It is $40 million in a good state, which is the promised

120
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,390
payment, but in the bad state, the payoff is only $10 million,

121
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,240
which is all the value from the asset.

122
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,260
This is a default state.

123
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,820
The last column gives the payoff to the equity holders.

124
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,500
It is $100 million minus $40 million,

125
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,180
which equals $60 million in the good state, the remainder

126
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,670
of the asset after paying off the debt.

127
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,280
But in the bad state, the payoff to equity holders is zero.

128
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,970
In the default state, the equity holders get nothing.

129
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,180
The second table on the slide shows

130
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,730
the payoff to the debt and equity holders

131
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,800
with the project.

132
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,120
Here we assume that, in order to take the project,

133
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,290
the equity holders will need to put up the initial investment

134
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,335
of $15 million.

135
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:11,940
The third column in the table gives the asset value

136
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,664
with the new project, in millions of dollars.

137
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:18,230
In the good state, it is $100 million,

138
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,020
the asset value without the project, plus $20 million,

139
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,330
the value from the new project.

140
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,050
That gives us $120 million.

141
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,960
In the bad state, the total asset value will be $10 million

142
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,590
plus $20 million, and that is $30 million.

143
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:38,600
The fourth column gives the payoff to debt holders.

144
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,760
In the good state, it's still $40 million,

145
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,330
the face value of the debt.

146
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,580
In the bad state, the payoff becomes $30 million,

147
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,970
which is the total value of the asset.

148
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,920
This is higher than the value without the project,

149
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,700
but still leads to default, as it falls short of $40 million,

150
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,960
the face value of the debt.

151
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,130
The last column gives the payoff to equity holders.

152
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,740
It is $120 million minus $40 million, that is $80 million

153
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,050
in the good state, but still zero in the bad state.

154
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,720
For the firm's equity holders, the NPV

155
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,200
from taking on the project is minus $15 million,

156
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,500
the initial investment, plus the expected payoff next year,

157
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,120
which is half times $20 million plus half times zero,

158
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,200
discounted at zero interest rate, which gives minus

159
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,010
$5 million.

160
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,850
Here, we can use the risk-free interest rate

161
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:40,460
as the discount rate because the risk is idiosyncratic.

162
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,120
Clearly, equity holders who are running the company

163
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,000
before default will not take on the project

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,360
today, despite its positive NPV.

165
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,760
What's going on here?

166
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,520
Well let's take a careful look at the situation.

167
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,000
For the shareholders, if they take on the project,

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,140
they will incur the full cost of the initial investment, which

169
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:12,270
is $50 million, but they only receive part of its payoff--

170
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,820
$20 million in the good state.

171
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,480
For the existing debt holders, if the project is taken,

172
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,250
they incur none of the investment

173
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,030
costs, but they receive part of its payoff--

174
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,280
$20 million in the bad state.

175
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,110
Put it differently, for equity holders perspective,

176
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:37,510
existing risky debt acts like a tax on new investments.

177
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,320
From this example, we have learned the following--

178
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,770
shareholders of the firm in financial distress

179
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,530
are reluctant to fund valuable projects

180
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,640
when most of the benefits go to existing debt holders.

181
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,140
This type of a problem is also called debt overhang.

182
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,040
This effect is larger as the debt becomes riskier,

183
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,240
and financial distress becomes more likely.

184
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,500
The debt overhang problem shows the potential divergence

185
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,260
in the interest of debt and equity holders

186
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,740
under financial distress.
