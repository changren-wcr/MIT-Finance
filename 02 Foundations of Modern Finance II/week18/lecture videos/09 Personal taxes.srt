1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,690
PROFESSOR: So far, we have only considered taxes

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,340
at the firm level and ignored taxes at the personal level.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,370
As it turns out, personal taxes are also

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,190
important in effecting firms capital structure choices.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,660
We now consider the effect of personal taxes.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,420
Let's start with the following simple setting.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,230
The firm's asset yields a pre-tax expected cash

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,640
flow X next year and nothing afterwards.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,920
It has debt at level D. The interest rate on debt is rD.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,720
Corporate tax rate is tau.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,880
In addition, investors also pay personal taxes.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,870
The tax rate on equity, which includes taxes on dividends

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,670
and capital gains is pi.

14
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,860
The tax rate on debt interest is delta.

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,190
Let's ignore cost of financial distress for the moment.

16
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,520
In general, tax code is a lot more complicated

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,460
than what is assumed here.

18
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,400
We use a simple structure merely to illustrate

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,490
the potential impact on personal taxes.

20
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,220
We first consider the cash flow next year

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,010
after corporate and personal taxes.

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,980
To equity holders, it is 1 minus pi times 1 minus tau times

23
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,560
x minus rD times D. x minus rD times D

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,460
is the asset payoff after interests.

25
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,290
Times 1 minus tau is what we have after corporate tax.

26
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,200
Then times 1 minus pi is what is left after personal tax equity

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,490
payoff.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,430
To debt holders, it is 1 minus delta times rD times D.

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,670
The total after tax cash flow is the sum

30
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,360
of the two, which gives 1 minus pi times 1 minus tau times x

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,250
plus 1 minus delta minus 1 minus pi times 1 minus

32
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,160
tau, then times the interest payment on debt,

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,220
which is rD times D.

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,000
Here, the first term gives the after tax payoff to the firm,

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,140
if it's all equity financed.

36
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,530
The second term gives the tax impact of debt.

37
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,160
The present value is given by the after tax cash flow

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,880
discounted at the appropriate discount rates.

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,540
As an approximation, we can use the following.

40
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,930
For all equity financed firms, the discount rate

41
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:52,250
is 1 minus pi times ra, the after tax return on assets.

42
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,470
For debt income, the discount rate

43
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:00,710
is 1 minus delta times rD, also the after tax return on debt.

44
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,560
For our purposes, we only need to know

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,750
that the value of the leverage firm

46
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,280
is VL equals the present value of 1

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,970
minus pi times 1 minus tau times x,

48
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,860
that's the after tax cash flow for an unlevered firm,

49
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,610
plus the present value of the debt effect, which

50
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,590
is 1 minus delta minus 1 minus pi times 1 minus tau times

51
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,680
rD times D.

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,910
We then arrive at the extension of MM1

53
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,180
with both corporate and personal taxes.

54
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,990
The firm's value is given by VL equals VU plus 1 minus

55
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,340
delta minus 1 minus pi times 1 minus tau times

56
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,225
the present value of rD times D.

57
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:57,000
In order to show the impact of personal taxes,

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,420
we consider several special cases.

59
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,570
If equity pays large dividends and pi

60
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,350
equals delta, that is dividend is taxed

61
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:14,590
at the same rate as interest, then VL equals VU plus 1

62
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:21,760
minus delta times tau times PV of rD times D. In this case,

63
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,270
debt has a clear advantage over equity as it brings tax shield.

64
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,290
If equity can avoid dividends, it becomes more attractive.

65
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,010
In particular when pi is less than delta,

66
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,030
the tax shield of debt becomes less than 1 minus delta

67
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,580
times tau times the present value of rD times D.

68
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,450
If capital gains tax can be avoided,

69
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,300
equity might dominate debt in financing.

70
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,310
In particular, if pi is approximately 0, which

71
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,820
means that the tax on equity is practically 0,

72
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,730
we then have 1 minus delta minus 1 minus tau less than 0

73
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,550
when tau is less than delta.

74
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,690
In this case, debt has a negative overall tax shield.

75
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,420
Although our analysis is simplified,

76
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,650
it demonstrates that if equity enjoys a tax advantage

77
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,850
at the personal level, it can offset the tax advantage

78
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,080
debt enjoys at the firm level.
