1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,520
PROFESSOR: We want to illustrate the points

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,550
above through an example.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,970
415inc is a fintech company.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,720
It's currently 100% equity-financed.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,480
The value of its asset is given by

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,880
the following binomial process.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,390
Its current market value at year 0 is $100 million.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,130
Next year, which is year 1, the asset value can go up to 120

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,490
or stay at 100 with equal probabilities.

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,280
The risk-free rate is 5%.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,220
415inc learned from its investment banker

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,770
that you can issue a one-year bond

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,920
with the principal amount P equals 80

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,930
at a reasonable promised yield y.

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,710
When 415inc fails to pay the interest in full,

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:01:00,120
it incurs a cost of default. The cost is given by c times yP

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,180
minus capital Y squared, where yP is the promised interest

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,310
payment and capital Y is the actual interest paid,

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:19,020
where capital Y is no greater than yP and c equals 1/320.

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,590
The cost is positive only when capital Y

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,640
is less than y times P.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,700
Since P equals 80, and the asset value is 100 in the bad state,

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,010
415inc will never default on the principal.

24
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:44,400
415inc's tax rate is tau equals 30%.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,990
As the CEO of 415inc, you need to answer the following

26
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,760
questions.

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,860
Should you issue the bond?

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,410
Why?

29
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,930
If you decide to issue the bond, how

30
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,520
should you choose y, which is the promised yield?

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,750
How much can you increase the value of 415inc today

32
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,120
by doing this?

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,340
We consider the situation in two steps.

34
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,500
First, suppose that 415inc wants to issue

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,220
bonds that's risk-free.

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,540
Then in a down state the asset value is 100.

37
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,770
In order to guarantee both the principal and interest payment,

38
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:32,260
we have 1 plus y times P no greater than Vd,

39
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,080
the value of the asset in a down state,

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,830
or 1 plus y times 80 no greater than 100.

41
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,960
This will give y no greater than 0.25.

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,550
That is, the promised yield cannot exceed 25%.

43
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:54,070
Therefore, if 415inc issues the one-year bond with principal P

44
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:59,050
equals 80 and promised yield y, the promised interest payment

45
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,880
will be yP.

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,710
That's 80 times y.

47
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:10,190
The tax shield is tau times yP in both states in year 1.

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,550
Its present value is then PVTS--

49
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,340
that's Present Value of Tax Shield--

50
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,920
equals 0.3, the tax rate, times the promised interest payment--

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,790
that's 80 times y divided by 1 plus 5%, the discount rate.

52
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,070
And that gives 22.86 times y.

53
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,700
This is positive and increases with y.

54
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,120
The value of 415inc now becomes VL,

55
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,640
the value of the levered home equals

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,520
VU, the value of the unlevered firm,

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,290
plus PVTS, which is a function of the debt level D.

58
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:55,180
That equals 100 plus 22.86 times y.

59
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:02,300
It is maximized by setting y equals 0.25 without default,

60
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,670
which gives 105.72.

61
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,810
This is higher than the value of the unlevered firm, which

62
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,100
is 100.

63
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,839
Can we do better than this?

64
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:22,550
Next, we consider when y goes beyond 25%.

65
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,030
Increasing y will further increase the tax benefit.

66
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,560
However, there will be default in the down state.

67
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,510
Here, we will assume 80 times y is no greater than 40,

68
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,520
or y is no greater than 0.5, so that there will not

69
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,860
be default in the up state.

70
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,440
Now in the up state, we will get more tax shield,

71
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,990
which is tau times yP, and increases with y.

72
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,140
But in a down state, the actual interest payment

73
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,410
is Vd, the value of the asset in the down state,

74
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,490
minus P, the principal, which equals 100 minus 80,

75
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,340
and that's 20.

76
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,060
It gives a tax shield of 0.3 times

77
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,050
20, which is fixed and independent of y.

78
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:23,300
The default amount in the down state is 80 times y minus 0.25.

79
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,470
It leads to a default cost given by the default cost, which

80
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:33,500
depends on y, the promised yield, that equals c times 80

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,010
squared times y minus 0.25 squared.

82
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,030
Therefore, we have the value of the firm with leverage

83
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:50,240
to be VL equals VU plus the present value of tax shield,

84
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,350
which depends on y, minus the present value of default cost,

85
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,600
which also depends on y.

86
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,367
That gives 100 plus the two additional terms,

87
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,950
namely the present value of tax shield

88
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,590
and present value of default cost.

89
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,380
How do we value tax shield and default costs,

90
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,720
which are now both risky?

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,260
In order to value the risky tax shield and default cost,

92
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,610
we need to find the risk-neutral probabilities for the two

93
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,540
states in year 1.

94
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,300
Given the binomial process for the value

95
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,150
of the underlying asset, we should know how

96
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,110
to do this pretty well by now.

97
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,860
From the price of the asset, we have

98
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,890
100 equals q, the risk-neutral probability

99
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,800
for up state, times 120, the value

100
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,600
of the asset in a good state, plus 1 minus q,

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,700
the risk-neutral probability for the down state,

102
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,280
times the value of the asset in a down state

103
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,080
that's 100, divided by 1 plus the risk-free rate.

104
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,820
Solving for this equation, we'll get q equals 1/4.

105
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,470
Then the present value of tax shield is given by PVTS equals

106
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,680
0.3, the tax rate, times 1/4, the risk-neutral probably

107
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,050
for the up state, times 80y--

108
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,230
that's the interest payment in a good state--

109
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:23,690
plus 3/4 times 20, and then divide

110
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,400
by 1 plus risk-free rate.

111
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,720
Finishing the calculation, we get 6.86.

112
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,970
The present value of default cost is given by PVDC.

113
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,660
That equals 3/4 times 1/320, the coefficient of default cost,

114
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,910
times 80 squared times y minus 0.25 squared,

115
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,140
and again divided by 1 plus the risk-free rate of 5%.

116
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,330
Finishing the calculation gives 0.57.

117
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,840
In the above, we have also solved for the optimal y

118
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,020
to be 0.45, which is less than 0.5 Indeed,

119
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,770
and substituted it into PVTS and PVDC.

120
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:19,590
At y equals 0.45, the default cost is 0.8.

121
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,900
The value of the levered firm, which

122
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,680
is maximized at y equals 0.45, is

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:36,809
given by VL equals VU plus PVTS at y equal to 0.45 minus PVDC,

124
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,929
also at 0.45.

125
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,280
That gives us 100, the value of the unlevered firm,

126
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,570
plus 6.86, which is the present value of tax shield,

127
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,950
minus 0.57, which is the present value of the default cost.

128
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,220
That gives us 106.29.

129
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,330
The market value of the debt is given by D equals q,

130
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,310
the risk-neutral probability for the up state,

131
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,390
times 80 times 1 plus 0.45--

132
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,840
that's the total payoff in the up state-- plus 1 minus

133
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,890
q, the risk-neutral probability for the down state, times 100

134
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,310
minus 0.8, which is default cost.

135
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,340
And then divide that by 1 plus the risk-free rate of 5%,

136
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,640
the calculation gives us 98.48, which is at a premium,

137
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,450
because the price is higher than the par value of the debt.

138
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,230
What to do with the proceeds from the bond issue then?

139
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,640
Well, we can use the money to buy back shares.

140
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,110
We will discuss the mechanics of share buyback in lecture 20,

141
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,380
when we consider payout policies.

142
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,340
The market value of equity after the share repurchase is E

143
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,390
equals the value of the levered firm minus debt,

144
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,850
which is 106.29 minus 99.48.

145
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:14,320
And that gives $7.81 million.

146
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,210
The above refinancing has increased the shareholder value

147
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:27,644
by 106.29 minus 100, which is $6.29 million.

148
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:30,460
The above example, although simple,

149
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,910
has shown the following.

150
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,670
First, how leverage leads to a firm's tax benefit and distress

151
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,410
cost; second, how to value the tax benefit and cost

152
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,150
of distress; third, how to optimize a firm's capital

153
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,460
structure knowing the value of these two pieces;

154
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,820
and four, how much value the optimal financing

155
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,210
choice can bring.
