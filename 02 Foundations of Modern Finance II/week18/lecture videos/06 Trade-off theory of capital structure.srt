00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,100
PROFESSOR: Putting the pieces together,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,820
we arrive at a simple theory on capital structure.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,050
From the MM Irrelevance Theorem, the value of the firm

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,270
starts with the value of its asset.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,900
We then add two ingredients that can change the size of the pie.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,760
The first is taxes.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,370
In particular, favorable tax treatment

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,460
of debt at the corporate level gives debt

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,900
a tax advantage in financing.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,630
However, debt raises the possibility

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,860
of financial distress.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,680
The present value of distress costs

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,030
tend to offset the value from debt's tax shield.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,730
The trade off between these two factors

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:53,350
gives the static optimum for a firm's capital structure.

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,670
This theory views the firm and its capital structure

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,760
as relatively stable over time.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,010
As we'll see later, often we have

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,850
to properly capture the time evolution of the firm's

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,790
asset, debt, and equity.

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,870
In other words, a more dynamic framework is needed.

22
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,860
We will return to this point in the next lecture.

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,490
The figure on the slide illustrates the key insights

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,280
behind the trade-off theory.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,840
The x-axis is a firm's debt or leverage level.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,320
The y-axis is the value of the firm.

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,650
The red a horizontal line plots the value of the firm

28
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,790
if it is unlevered.

29
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,870
According to MM, it's also the value of the levered firm

30
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,340
in the absence of frictions.

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,310
The blue dotted line plots the value

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,710
of the levered firm with the tax shield

33
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,090
from debt with no cost of financial distress.

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,150
Here the present value of the tax shield

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,940
increases linearly with the debt level.

36
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,720
In the absence of distress cost, the firm

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,560
would increase the debt level.

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,450
However, as the level of debt increases,

39
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,580
it also becomes riskier.

40
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,240
The chance of financial distress increases, and so does

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,420
the present value of distress cost.

42
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,360
This will bring down the value of the firm

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,560
from the blue dotted line, yielding the solid black line.

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,300
At low levels of debt, the cost of financial distress is small

45
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,660
and the tax benefit dominates.

46
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,500
As the debt level increases, the cost of financial distress

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,380
will start to dominate.

48
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,700
The optimum is at an intermediate debt level

49
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,100
which maximizes the total value of the firm,

50
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,730
including the present value of tax shield

51
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,550
and the present value of distress cost.

52
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:05,380
This optimum gives the optimal capital structure.

53
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,940
Clearly, it's determined by how the present value of tax shield

54
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,950
and the present value of distress cost

55
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,950
change with the firm's debt level.

56
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,170
We can also express the trade-off theory as follows.

57
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,660
The value of the levered firm is given

58
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,130
by the value of the unlevered firm plus adjustments

59
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,600
from the leverage effect, which includes two items--

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,220
tax benefit from debt and cost of financial distress,

61
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,420
also from debt.

62
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,680
Analytically, we have VL, the value of the levered firm,

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,950
equals VU, the value of the unlevered firm,

64
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,040
plus the present value of tax shield from debt

65
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,860
minus the present value of cost of financial distress.

66
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,140
We also call this the Adjusted Present Value, or APV.

67
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,480
The optimal level of debt is chosen

68
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,680
to maximize the VL, the firm's total value, including

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,780
the leverage effects or its APV.

70
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,840
From the trade-off theory, we can immediately

71
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,830
draw useful implications.

72
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,329
First, firms with low present value of financial distress

73
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,210
cost should load up on debt to increase tax benefits.

74
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,320
Second, firms with high present value of distress costs

75
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,990
should be more conservative in leverage.

76
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,130
Third, the key then lies in knowing the industry

77
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,450
and company characteristics that lead to high present value

78
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,130
of distress costs.

79
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,580
In particular, we can write the following,

80
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,650
the present value of distress cost

81
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,100
equals the risk neutral probability of distress

82
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,240
times the distress cost.
