00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,720
PROFESSOR: If corporate tax is the only issue,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,080
most companies will be 100% debt-financed.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,060
This can't be the whole story.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,200
From the data we have seen, this is not what firms do.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,660
The debt-to-asset ratio is roughly 30%, not 100%.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,130
Common sense suggests that debt is not without costs.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,620
It has its dark side.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,400
In particular, when debt burden is too high,

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,220
the firm may have trouble paying, at least

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,780
in some states of the economy.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,670
The difficulty in paying will result in financial distress.

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,400
Financial distress involves additional costs.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,590
These costs can offset the benefit of more debt.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,380
Let's consider the issue of financial distress

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,530
in more detail.

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,170
Financial distress refers to the situation

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,130
when a firm's cash flow becomes insufficient in covering

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,740
its current obligations.

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,240
It will lead to a process of resolving the broken contracts

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,340
with creditors.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,320
Such a process takes two forms.

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,510
One is private negotiation or workout.

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,420
Another is bankruptcy supervised by a court.

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,270
In analyzing the cause of financial distress

25
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,090
and its costs, it is important to separate causes and effects.

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,630
In particular, only those costs that

27
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,880
would not rise outside financial distress should be counted.

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,620
For example, a firm in financial distress performs poorly.

29
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,230
Is this a cause or effect?

30
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,880
Well, it depends.

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,210
Poor performance may have caused the financial distress

32
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,870
in the first place.

33
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,370
But financial distress can put additional pressure

34
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,940
on the firm, leading to further deterioration

35
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,200
of its performance.

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,280
The second part should count as an effect

37
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,440
of financial distress.

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,310
We can illustrate how the cost of financial distress

39
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,290
can be important, using again the pie analogy.

40
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,460
The chart on the slide shows how the value of the firm's asset

41
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,940
is split between the different pieces.

42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,160
The total pie is given by the value of the firm's asset,

43
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,220
which is fixed.

44
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,030
The pie, then, is divided between the different claims

45
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,800
on the firm.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,850
The first claim is taxes, which goes to the government.

47
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,590
This piece has the highest priority.

48
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:51,300
The second claim is debt, which is the next senior.

49
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,760
The third claim is equity, which is the most junior claim.

50
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,660
The last piece is the cost of financial distress, which

51
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,920
reflects the value it destroys.

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,130
In present value terms, we have the present value

53
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,720
of the asset divided into the present value of the four

54
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,870
slices.

55
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,930
For the firm stakeholders, the objective

56
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,590
is to maximize the total value of the firm, which

57
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,980
is debt plus equity.

58
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,460
From the chart, we can see that increasing debt

59
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,540
can reduce taxes and thus increase d plus e.

60
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,140
However, by doing so, the cost of financial distress

61
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,820
also increases, which tends to offset the tax benefit of debt.

62
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,700
If this cost becomes very high, you

63
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,580
will then overwhelm the firm's incentive

64
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,870
to further increasing leverage.
