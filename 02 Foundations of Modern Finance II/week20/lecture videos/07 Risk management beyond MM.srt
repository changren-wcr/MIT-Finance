00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,440
INSTRUCTOR: Regarding the question

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,440
about whether a firm should hedge,

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,590
we make the following observations.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,650
First, hedging involves only transactions

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,340
in the financial market at market prices.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,340
Therefore, under the conditions of MM,

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,970
that is there's no frictions in the financial market,

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,360
hedging has no impact on firm value.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,210
In particular, the no frictions condition

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,760
assumes no taxes, no transaction costs or constraints

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,050
in the financial market, equal access to the financial market

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,740
for shareholders and managers, same information

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,670
for shareholders and managers, no cost of financial distress.

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,810
The logic of the MM irrelevance result is the same as before.

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,860
Managers cannot create value by making financial transactions

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,060
that shareholders can do on their own.

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,710
In the MM world, whatever risks a firm takes on,

18
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,880
the shareholders can manage these risks by themselves

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,740
according to their own preferences.

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,480
For example, shareholders can hedge market risks

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,170
by trading in the same set of instruments.

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,880
They can diversify idiosyncratic risks more easily than the firm

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,280
by holding a diversified portfolio.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,850
They can buy the same set of insurance contracts

25
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,240
to avoid idiosyncratic risks.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,350
Another way to articulate the MM insight

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,800
is that in absence of superior information,

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,620
transactions in the financial market are zero NPV activities.

29
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,310
Of course, frictions can change the picture.

30
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,470
A firm should manage its risk if it increases firm value.

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,370
This can happen in the presence of frictions.

32
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,570
In particular, if hedging can reduce taxes,

33
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,080
managers have better hedging opportunities than shareholders

34
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,100
such as facing smaller transaction costs, lower

35
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,730
capital requirements, managers have better information

36
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,610
on the firm's exposures, hedging can

37
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,520
reduce cost of financial distress,

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,110
hedging can help to reduce agency costs between managers

39
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,490
and shareholders, and between shareholders and debt holders.

40
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,280
We use an example to illustrate how

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,330
market frictions may allow risk management to create value

42
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,040
for a firm.

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,270
Let's consider the example of 415inc in lecture 18.

44
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,050
The basic situation is as follows.

45
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,310
For more details, you can refer to lecture 18.

46
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:02,360
415inc has asset of a current value of $100 million,

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,730
which is 100% equity financed.

48
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,650
The asset value next year will be either 120 or 100,

49
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,460
with equal probabilities.

50
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,130
The risk-free rate is 5%.

51
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,300
The risk-neutral probability for the upstate is a quarter.

52
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,250
415inc intends to issue a debt with the par value of 80

53
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,950
at a promise yield of y, with a tax rate of 30%,

54
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,000
and distress cost of C times the total default amount

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,780
squared, where C equals 1 over 320,

56
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,060
the optimal promised yield is 45%.

57
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,680
The leverage creates a tax shield of 10.8 and 6

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,120
in the upper and down state, respectively.

59
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,010
Default occurs in the down state with interest payment of 100

60
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,520
over 80 minus one, that's 25%.

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,350
The default amount is 80, that's the principal times 45%, which

62
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,560
is the promised yield minus 25%.

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,900
The key information is summarized

64
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,730
in the table on the slide.

65
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,029
With the risk-neutral probability and risk-free rate,

66
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,200
we can price the leverage effect,

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,230
which is given by PVTS minus PVDC, that

68
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,720
equals 1/4 times 10.8, that's the tax shield in the upstate,

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,800
plus 3/4 the relationship probability for downstate times

70
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,470
6, that's the tax credit in the downstate,

71
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,410
minus 0.8, that's the default cost.

72
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,600
Divide that by 1 plus the risk free rate

73
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,220
of 5%, that gives us 6.29.

74
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,470
The firm value with leverage effect

75
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,610
is then 100, that's the value of the asset, plus 6.29.

76
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,360
That gives us 106.29.

77
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,190
Suppose that 415inc enters into the following financial

78
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,760
contract to hedge its default risk.

79
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,740
The contract pays $1 in the down state and minus $3

80
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,010
in the upstate in year one.

81
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,960
Given the risk-neutral probability

82
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,510
and the risk-free rate, its current price

83
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,740
should be minus 3, that's the payoff in upstate times 1/4,

84
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,100
that's the risk-neutral probability for the upstate.

85
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,540
Then plus 1, that's the payoff in a downstate times 3/4,

86
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,180
that risk neutral probability for the downstate.

87
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,820
Divide it again by 1 plus the risk free rate

88
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,680
of 5%, that gives us zero.

89
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,620
This is like a forward or swap contract

90
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,480
with the current price of zero.

91
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,260
Future payoffs differently in different states.

92
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,010
With the hedge, 415inc will receive $1

93
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,860
from the contract in the default state.

94
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,240
It can use this to increase its payment to the debt holders.

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,060
The actual interest payment now becomes

96
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,830
101 divided by 80, the principal amount, minus 1.

97
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,840
That gives us 26.25%.

98
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,070
This is still below the promised 45%.

99
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,350
The default still occurs, but it increases the total interest

100
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,310
payment in a down state which creates more tax shield

101
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,640
and decreases the default amount, which

102
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,310
reduces the distress cost.

103
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,040
The key cash flows with the hedge

104
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,970
are given in the table on the slide.

105
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,790
In particular, the tax shield in the down state

106
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:43,130
is now 6.3 higher than 6 without the hedge.

107
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:49,370
The distress cost is now 0.7031, which is lower than eight

108
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,020
without the hedge.

109
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,550
If we now look at leverage effect with the hedge,

110
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,080
its total value is given as follows.

111
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,230
PVTS minus PVDC equals 1/4 times 10.8,

112
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,080
that's for the upstate same as before,

113
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,130
plus 3/4, the risk-neutral probability for downstate,

114
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:18,190
times 6.3, the tax credit, minus 0.7031,

115
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,630
that's the default cost.

116
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,140
And then, divide by 1 plus the 5% risk-free rate.

117
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,810
Finishing the calculation, we get 6.57.

118
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:35,070
Clearly, firm value is now 100 plus 6.57, that's 106.5,

119
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,910
with the hedge.

120
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,240
This is higher than its value without the hedge.

121
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,220
In this case, hedging adds value in two ways.

122
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,810
First, it increases tax shield in a downstate,

123
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,370
and second, it reduces distress costs in the downstate.

124
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,020
In the analysis above, we did not try to optimize the hedge.

125
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,140
If there are no other costs and constraints,

126
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,990
415inc should do more of the hedge

127
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,660
to further increase value.

128
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,380
But our purpose here is merely to demonstrate the point, that

129
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,530
is, in the presence of frictions,

130
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,440
in this case taxes and distress caused,

131
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,170
hedging can increase firm value by helping

132
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:26,640
to overcome the negative impact of frictions.

133
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,070
Our general point is that when it

134
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,970
comes to the question about whether to hedge,

135
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,820
we need to first identify frictions

136
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,240
that have negative effects on firm value,

137
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,310
and then consider if reducing certain risks by hedging

138
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,410
can help to mitigate these effects.
