1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
PROFESSOR: We now turn our attention

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,070
to how to execute a risk management strategy

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,790
if the firm chooses one.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,820
We will start with a discussion on the basic idea

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,930
behind hedging and then consider a series of examples

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,190
on its application in various situations.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,040
As I said earlier, a firm is exposed to different market

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,600
or factor risks from both its asset and liability side.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,240
For example, an airliner's profit

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,880
is exposed to oil price risk.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,090
An increase in oil price will negatively impact its profit.

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,390
The firm can use market instruments

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,910
to reduce these risks.

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,130
In the above example, the airliner

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,400
can reduce its exposure to oil price risk

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,490
by buying oil forwards or futures.

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,270
Such an operation in the case of the airline example

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,980
is called hedging.

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,150
The basic idea is to take on additional positions whose

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,349
gains and losses can offset at least partially the gains

21
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,170
and losses from the original position where

22
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,740
market prices change.

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,000
To consider this more formally, we introduce some notation.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,650
Let V original denote the value of the original position, which

25
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,720
is unhedged, V hedging denote the value of the hedging

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,310
instrument or hedging vehicle, V net

27
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,370
denote the value of the hedged position.

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,190
As market or factor prices change,

29
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,490
the values of these positions also change.

30
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,780
In particular, we have the delta v

31
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,490
net, the change in value of the net position,

32
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,410
equals delta v original plus hedge ratio times

33
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,830
delta of v hedging.

34
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,530
The hedging is perfect under two conditions.

35
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,180
First, delta v original and delta v hedging

36
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,470
are perfectly correlated.

37
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,030
Second, hedge ratio is appropriately chosen.

38
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,400
In the case of perfect hedge, the risk

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,880
can be completely avoided or hedged away.

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,240
Otherwise, the hedging is imperfect.

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,560
Next, we will consider several common risks firms face

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,000
and how to hedge them.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,630
Many firms face commodity price risks.

44
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,480
We use an example to illustrate possible hedging

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,310
strategies against these risks.

46
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,480
Suppose that you are managing an oil exploration company

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,120
and have just found oil.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,740
You expect to have one million barrels of oil in five months.

49
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,060
Given the high volatility of oil prices,

50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,150
there is high uncertainty about what the oil

51
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,640
price will be in five months.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,370
And you would like to hedge this risk.

53
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,590
There are various ways you can do this.

54
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,670
One is to use forwards on oil.

55
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,360
Another is to use oil futures.

56
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,890
Let's first consider how to use oil forwards to hedge.

57
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,640
You can hedge your position by selling forward

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,850
one million barrels of oil today.

59
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,890
Let St be the spot oil price at time t in months.

60
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,870
Then for each barrel of oil, we can list positions and payoffs

61
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,950
in the table on the slide.

62
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,830
The first column lists the positions,

63
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,840
and the second column gives their payoffs in month five.

64
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,850
The original position is a long position in one barrel of oil.

65
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,980
Its payoff at t equals 5 is simply

66
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,730
S5, the spot oil price then.

67
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,230
The hedging position in this case is short one barrel of oil

68
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,080
in forwards.

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,240
Its payoff at t equal to 5 is F minus S5

70
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,110
where F is the current forward price for oil

71
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,810
for maturity in five months.

72
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,480
The last row in the second column

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,930
gives the net payoff of the hedged position

74
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,910
or the net position.

75
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,830
It is F, the current forward price, which is certain.

76
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,190
In this case, the value of the original position

77
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,340
is perfectly correlated with the value of the hedging

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:39,230
instrument, which is an oil forward with matching maturity.

79
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,000
Short the forwards with the hedge ratio of delta equal to 1

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,710
yields a perfect hedge.

81
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,750
The firm is able to lock in the value of the original position

82
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,120
at the current forward price F.

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,870
There are several drawbacks from trading forwards as we

84
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,680
discussed in the lecture on forwards and futures.

85
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,650
One is its lack of liquidity, and the other

86
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,190
is counterparty risk.

87
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,480
For example, suppose that after one month,

88
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,660
you discover that there's no oil.

89
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,260
Then you no longer need the forward contract.

90
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,230
In fact, if you hang on to the forward contract,

91
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,560
you will be exposed to the risk of a short position in oil.

92
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,520
In this case, you want to unwind your position

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,780
by buying back the contract.

94
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,810
Given the lack of liquidity for forward contracts,

95
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,390
this can be difficult and expensive.

96
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,500
In order to avoid liquidity problems with forwards,

97
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,180
you can use oil futures as the hedging instrument.

98
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,700
Let us continue with the example above.

99
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,680
You can sell one million barrels of oil in the futures market.

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,130
Suppose the size of each oil futures contract

101
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,590
is 1,000 barrels of oil.

102
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,990
The number of contracts you want to sell

103
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,040
or short is given by the following equation--

104
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,610
one million barrels, which is your total exposure,

105
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,080
divide by 1,000.

106
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,610
That's the contract size.

107
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,180
And that gives us 1,000 contracts.

108
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,760
As we know, the futures contracts

109
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,090
can be easily bought and sold in the market.

110
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,630
If in one month you want to unwind your position,

111
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,340
you can simply sell these contracts in the market.

112
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,260
Futures are easy to trade and bear little counterparty risk.

113
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,780
But they have their own limitations.

114
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,900
First, since futures contracts are standardized by exchanges,

115
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,970
they may not perfectly match the firm's hedging need.

116
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,210
Often, we find the following mismatches

117
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,330
between the original position and the futures

118
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,500
as a hedging vehicle.

119
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,870
First is mismatch in maturity.

120
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,290
For example, futures contracts typically

121
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,880
have short maturities in months while our exposure

122
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,930
can be for much longer term, say, in years.

123
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,080
The second is mismatch in size.

124
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,620
Since we cannot trade in fractional contracts,

125
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,940
the hedging position can only approximate our exposure with

126
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,620
raw contract numbers.

127
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,420
The third mismatch is in underlying assets.

128
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,180
The underlying asset for the futures contract

129
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,390
often is not identical to the underlying

130
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,810
asset of our original exposure.

131
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,790
For example, oil from Texas--

132
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:48,150
this is the underlying asset for oil futures, NYMEX.

133
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,390
It is not the same as oil from the Middle East.

134
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,140
Therefore, a perfect hedge using futures

135
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,880
is achievable only when first, the maturity of the futures

136
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,340
matches the timing of the cash flow

137
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,740
from the original position.

138
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,260
Second, the contract size matches

139
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,270
that of the original position.

140
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,570
And third, the cash flow being hedged

141
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,450
is linearly related to that of the futures.

142
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,380
When there's a mismatch in any of these dimensions

143
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,890
between the original position and the futures contract,

144
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,200
the hedge will not be perfect.

145
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,750
In the case of an imperfect hedge,

146
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,049
we have to realize that although hedging partially

147
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,440
reduces the risk of the original position,

148
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,980
it may also pick up additional risks from the hedging

149
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,419
position.

150
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,580
There is another practical issue we

151
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,330
want to mention when using futures to hedge.

152
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,450
That is while futures are liquid to trade,

153
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,480
they do carry the liquidity risk from mark-to-market.

154
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,590
Let's again use the example above to illustrate.

155
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,100
Suppose that we have an oil well whose market

156
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,110
value is AT, which will change with oil price proportionally.

157
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,580
To reduce risk, we can take on an offsetting position

158
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,100
in oil futures, say, by selling oil futures.

159
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,150
Suppose that the hedge is almost perfect.

160
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,020
As the oil price falls, AT declines.

161
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,060
But the short position in futures

162
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,940
will make money, which offsets the losses

163
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,650
from the original position.

164
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,210
As the oil price rises, we gain value on AT

165
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,230
but incur losses from the hedge.

166
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,710
In terms of market value, we are breaking even

167
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,870
immune to the oil price risk.

168
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,000
However, marking to market our futures position

169
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
requires an immediate cash outflow.

170
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,820
The gain in the value of the well

171
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,930
comes from higher cash flows in the future.

172
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,410
The mismatch in the timing of these two cash flows

173
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,230
gives rise to a liquidity need.

174
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,700
We have to come up with funds to meet the margin requirements

175
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,440
right away.

176
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,580
Normally, this can be done by using the firm's cash reserves

177
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,580
or borrowing against future cash flows.

178
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,690
But what happens if the firm is financially constrained?

179
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,490
You will then face a liquidity crunch.

180
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,480
This example shows that mark-to-market for futures

181
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,590
may expose the firm to an additional liquidity risk which

182
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,080
is not present originally.

183
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,570
The firm needs to understand and manage

184
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,790
this risk well when using futures as hedging instruments.

185
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,670
There have been many examples where firms were

186
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,870
burned by this liquidity risk.
