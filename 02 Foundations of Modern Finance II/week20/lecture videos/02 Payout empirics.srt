1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,250
PROFESSOR: Before we start examining the driving factors

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,460
behind firms' payout policies, let's

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,480
take a look at what they actually do.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,120
As I said before, data always provide

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,610
useful empirical guidance and discipline for our analysis.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,850
Below is a list of facts on dividends.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,610
First, dividends are widespread.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,120
Most Fortune 500 firms pay dividends.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,299
Second, dividends are substantial.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,920
About 50% to 60% of firms' after-tax profit

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,060
are paid in dividends.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,340
Third, cash dividend is the main form of payout until recently.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,960
Fourth, share repurchase has become more popular over time.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,020
Five, high tax bracket individuals

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,930
receive most dividends.

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,700
Six, general payout policy patterns, which were first

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,000
provided by Lintner, include--

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,430
payout ratios are quite stable over the long run.

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,980
Managers worry more about changes,

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,850
rather than levels of dividends.

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,870
Dividend policies precede other decisions.

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,510
Firms even use outside funds to pay dividends, if needed.

23
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,340
Seven, stock price increases or decreases when dividends

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,040
are initiated or omitted.

25
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,650
In particular, we observe 3.7% at dividend initiation

26
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:45,800
and minus 7.0% at omission of dividends.

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,220
Survey of corporate executives also gives similar evidence.

28
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,460
The table on the slide shows their response

29
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,360
to the following question: do these statements

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,020
describe factors that affect your company's dividend

31
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,790
decisions?

32
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,100
A large majority of them expressed

33
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,229
the following preferences--

34
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,010
avoid cutting dividend, maintain smooth dividend.

35
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:19,410
Clearly, both executives and the market prefer smooth dividends.

36
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,300
This is reflected in the figure shown on this slide.

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:32,530
The x-axis is time from 1988 to 2008, over 20 years.

38
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,430
The y-axis shows the percentage of US firms

39
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,030
who experienced no change, increase,

40
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,900
and decrease in dividends, respectively, each year

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,450
during this period.

42
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,190
The green bar shows the percentage

43
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,540
of firms with no change in dividends in that year.

44
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,670
The blue bar shows the percentage

45
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,850
of firms with increase in dividends.

46
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,190
And the red bar shows the percentage

47
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,960
of firms with decrease in dividends in that year.

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,460
We see that, on average, about 65% of the firms

49
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,950
don't change their dividends.

50
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,220
About 30% increase their dividends.

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,830
And only about 5% decrease their dividends.

52
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,640
The data clearly shows that the majority of firms

53
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,570
keep their dividends stable.

54
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,280
In addition to looking at the aggregate pattern in dividends,

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,300
we can also look at the dividend policies of individual firms.

56
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,030
As an example, the figure on this slide

57
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,380
plots the dividend policy of General Motors, or GM,

58
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:50,960
from 1985 to 2008, over a time span of 23 years.

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,120
The x-axis is time.

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,600
The y-axis shows two quantities.

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,410
The red line plots GM's earnings per share,

62
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,290
and the blue line plots its dividend per share,

63
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,050
both on quarterly basis.

64
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,030
What's striking is that GM's earnings are very volatile,

65
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,960
while its dividend has been relatively smooth.

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,920
It has only adjusted dividends eight times during this time

67
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,800
period, although GM did cut its dividend in early 1990s

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,310
and after 2005 after large and persistent drops

69
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,320
in its earnings.

70
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,350
The dividend stays mostly constant,

71
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,560
while its earnings vary wildly.

72
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,000
This pattern is not unique.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,640
It is pervasive, as Lintner pointed out early on.

74
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,970
A natural question is, why do firms behave in this way?

75
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,600
As mentioned earlier, stock buybacks

76
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,220
have become more popular as a method of payout.

77
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,740
The figure on this slide partially

78
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,130
illustrates this point.

79
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:15,240
Again, the x-axis is time from 1999 to 2019, over 20 years.

80
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,430
The green bar shows the total cash dividends

81
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,590
in billion dollars paid quarterly by S&P 500 firms.

82
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,800
The blue bar shows the total amount

83
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,610
of buybacks by these companies, also quarterly

84
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,250
and in billion dollars.

85
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:38,430
The red line shows the level of S&P 500 index.

86
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,300
Two trends seem to emerge from the plot.

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,520
First, over this time period buybacks have increased a lot

88
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,360
and is overtaking dividend as a more important mean

89
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,040
of payout in recent years.

90
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,490
Second, buybacks tend to be more correlated

91
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,930
with the level of the stock market,

92
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,510
while dividends tend to be much less.
