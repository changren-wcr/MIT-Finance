00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
PROFESSOR: We now turn to the analysis of payout policy.

1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,990
As said before, the main question

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,660
is, how should a firm choose its payout policy?

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,960
We can also pose this question by a simple example.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,380
Suppose that your firm has a total value of $42 per share

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,300
with $40 in fixed assets and $2 in cash.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,750
Would you prefer to leave the $2 inside the firm

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,150
or to put it in your own pocket?

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,740
To answer this question, again, we'll start with the MM world.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,360
That is there are no taxes or transaction costs, no frictions

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,990
in the financial market.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,160
Then it follows directly from the MM irrelevance theorem

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,000
that, holding the firm's investment policy fixed,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
payout policy does not affect stockholder wealth

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,500
or the total value of the firm.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,400
Instead of deriving MM result mathematically, let

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,350
us illustrate it through an example.

17
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,330
Consider Gerron Corporation, a pharmaceutical company.

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,510
It has 10 million shares outstanding.

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,390
It expects a perpetual free cash flow of $48 million per year

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,070
starting from next year.

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,430
That's year one.

22
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,820
Gerron now has $20 million excess cash reserve.

23
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,800
It has no debt outstanding.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,500
Its cost of capital is 12%.

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,090
The board is deciding how to pay out the excess cash

26
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,660
to its shareholders.

27
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,920
The board is considering the following payout options.

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,300
One is pay out as cash dividend.

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,490
The other is pay out the excess cash by a share repurchase.

30
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,200
From the information above, we have the following.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,690
The excess cash is $20 million divided by 10 million shares.

32
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,440
And that is $2 per share.

33
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,110
Expected future dividend starting next year is $4.80 per

34
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,140
share forever.

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,255
The share price p before the payout is p equals 2--

36
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:28,010
it's the per share cash--

37
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,610
plus 4.8-- that's the per share future dividends--

38
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,090
divide by the cost of capital, which is 12%.

39
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,850
And that gives us $42.

40
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,720
Let's now consider the case of cash dividend.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,560
First, we observe that after the current dividend,

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,960
shareholders will only be receiving

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,860
the firm's future free cash flow as dividends.

44
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,810
Therefore, the ex-dividend price of the stock is px--

45
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,330
that's the x dividend stock price--

46
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,960
equals the present value of future dividends.

47
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,390
And that equals 4.80.

48
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,670
That's the per share future dividend

49
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,540
divide by the cost of capital, which is 0.12.

50
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,880
And that gives us $40.

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,480
The cum-dividend price will then be

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,970
Pcum equals the current dividend plus the ex-dividend price.

53
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,560
And that is 2 plus 4.80 divided by 0.12.

54
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,090
And that equals 2 plus 40, and that's $42.

55
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,900
The table on this slide summarizes what is going on.

56
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,350
The second column gives the situation

57
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,200
of the firm cum-dividend.

58
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,530
In million dollars, the cash is $20.

59
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,380
The value of the fixed asset is $400.

60
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,740
The total market value is $420.

61
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,250
With the total number of shares being 10 million,

62
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,170
we have the share price to be $42.

63
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,100
The third column gives the situation ex-dividend.

64
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,380
Again, in million dollars, the cash

65
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,070
drops to zero after the dividend payment.

66
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,798
The value of the fixed asset is still $400 million.

67
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,390
The total market value is $400.

68
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,490
And the share price is now $40.

69
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,000
Clearly, the share price drops by the same amount

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,720
after the cash dividend, no more, no less.

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,990
Therefore, we can conclude that in the financial market

72
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,990
without frictions, paying a dividend does not

73
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,510
change the firm's value.

74
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,120
We now consider the case when the firm

75
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,020
does a share repurchase instead of cash dividend.

76
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,050
In other words, Gerron will use the $20 million

77
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,920
extra cash to buy back its shares on the open market.

78
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,340
With the initial share price of $42,

79
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,400
Gerron will repurchase 476,000 shares.

80
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,580
Here, if we use $20 million of cash

81
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,070
divided by the share price of $42,

82
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,520
that gives us 0.476 million shares.

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,570
This will leave 10 minus 0.476.

84
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:27,750
That equals 9.524 million shares outstanding.

85
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,850
The key is that the share price will remain unchanged

86
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,410
after the buyback.

87
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,530
The situation before and after the buyback

88
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,670
is given in the table.

89
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,790
The second column gives the situation

90
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,440
before the share repurchase.

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,260
In million dollars, the cash is $20, the value of fixed asset

92
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,510
$400, the total market value $420 same as before.

93
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,070
With 10 million shares outstanding,

94
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,520
the share price is $42.

95
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,800
The third column describes the situation

96
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,820
after the share repurchase.

97
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,930
In million dollars, cash drops to zero.

98
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,170
The value of fixed asset is still $400.

99
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,530
The total market value drops to $400.

100
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,820
With 9.524 million shares remaining,

101
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,390
the share price is $42.

102
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,740
It should not be surprising that the repurchase has no effect

103
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,320
on Gerron's stock price.

104
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,390
Let's double check.

105
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,180
After the repurchase, the future dividend

106
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,410
will rise to $5.04 per share.

107
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,000
This comes from the fact that the total earnings for the firm

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,490
is $48 million, and we have 9.524 million shares

109
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,640
outstanding.

110
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,250
The ratio of the two gives us $5.04 per share.

111
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:01,670
Gerron's share price then is p repurchase equals $5.04 divide

112
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,700
by the cost of capital, which is 12%.

113
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,540
That gives us $42.

114
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,590
We can conclude that in the perfect financial market,

115
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,160
an open market share repurchase has no effect

116
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,930
on the current stock price.

117
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,010
Moreover, this is the same price as the cum-dividend price

118
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,080
if a dividend was paid instead.

119
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,130
Through the example above, we arrive at the following result.

120
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,020
In the MM world, shifting dividend or payout over time

121
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,690
does not change firm value.

122
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,500
Higher current dividend reduces future dividends.

123
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,190
The former payout, for example, dividend or repurchase

124
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,570
does not change firm value.

125
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,830
Formally, we can state the MM payout irrelevance theorem

126
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,720
as follows.

127
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,500
In the financial market with no frictions, holding investment

128
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,680
policy fixed, a firm's payout policy

129
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,750
is irrelevant and does not affect the firm's value.

130
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,070
This result leads to several immediate implications.

131
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,220
First, paying dividends or buying back shares

132
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,460
is a zero NPV transaction.

133
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,990
Firm value before dividend simply equals firm value

134
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,640
after dividend plus the dividend.

135
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,290
Second, investor preferences do not matter.

136
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,559
In the market with no frictions, investors

137
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,950
are indifferent between the firm distributing funds

138
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,460
via dividends or repurchases.

139
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,540
By reinvesting dividends or selling shares,

140
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,560
the shareholders can replicate either payout method by

141
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,810
themselves.
