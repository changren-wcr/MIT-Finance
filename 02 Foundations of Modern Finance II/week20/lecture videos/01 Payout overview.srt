00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
PROFESSOR: After analyzing a firm's financing decision,

1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,320
we now turn our attention to its payout policy.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,050
Payout is one of the two major components

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,460
of corporate financial decisions,

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,700
the other being capital structure.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,340
Its significance is reflected in many ways.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,730
For example, dividend cuts by firms

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,160
can lead to severe declines in stock price.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,360
On the other hand, maintaining stable payout

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,190
may prevent a firm from taking on valuable investments.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,620
From the corporate finance perspective,

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,680
an important question is, can a firm

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,020
increase its value by optimally choosing its payout policy?

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,760
If yes, what factors will determine its optimal payout?

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,640
From the market perspective, investors also

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,000
respond to a firm's dividend policy.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,570
If a firm deviates significantly from its desirable payout

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,780
policy, traditional investors may sell it.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,480
In some cases, active investors may

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,730
try to change the firm's payout policy.

20
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,750
In the first part of this lecture,

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,720
we examine how a firm's payout policy may affect its value.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,130
Payout policy refers to different ways

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:27,060
a firm can distribute its free cash flow to its shareholders.

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,270
As discussed in our analysis of common stocks

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,260
in part 1 of this course, a firm's free cash flow

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,600
is split into two parts--

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,120
retained and paid out.

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,020
This is illustrated by the figure on the slide.

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,270
Retained free cash flow, which is

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,060
shown on the left-hand side of the plot,

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,080
goes into either new investments or cash reserves.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,080
The free cash flow for payout shown

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,090
on the right-hand side of the plot

34
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,050
goes to shareholders either through share repurchase

35
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,740
or cash dividend.

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,890
The trade-off between retaining and paying out

37
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,590
depends on the efficient use of cash

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,360
within the firm, such as financing positive NPV projects

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,530
now or in the near future, reducing excessive cash

40
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,380
to avoid misuse.

41
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,340
As mentioned above, there are two ways to pay out--

42
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,070
dividend and share repurchase.

43
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,260
We quickly review the mechanics for these two methods.

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,940
We start with dividend, which falls into two categories--

45
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,060
regular dividend and special dividend.

46
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,790
As the name suggests, regular dividend

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,680
refers to dividends that are paid regularly in time.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,530
Special dividend refers to dividends paid only

49
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,100
under certain special circumstances such as winning

50
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,730
a big court case.

51
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,900
Other than its amount, several dates concerning a dividend

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,640
are important to note.

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,750
The first is the declaration date

54
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,920
on which the board of directors authorizes the dividend

55
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,870
payment.

56
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,360
Next is the record date.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,410
When the firm pays a dividend, only shareholders

58
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,320
on the record of this date receive the dividend.

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,420
The next thing is the ex-dividend date,

60
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,540
which is a date two days before the record date due to the T+2

61
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,130
settlement in the US on or after which investors buying

62
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,490
the stock will not be eligible for the dividend.

63
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,040
The next date is the cum-dividend date.

64
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,140
And that's the trading day right before the ex-dividend date.

65
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,660
The final date is the distribution date.

66
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,880
That is a date typically within a month

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,140
after the record date on which the firm pays the dividend

68
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,320
to its registered shareholders.

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,610
Next, we consider share repurchase or buyback.

70
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,280
In particular, a firm can use cash

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,650
to buy its own shares outstanding.

72
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,990
The shares repurchased can either be retired or kept

73
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,620
as treasury stock available for reissuance in the future.

74
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,770
There are three ways to conduct share repurchase.

75
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,830
The first method is open market repurchase.

76
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,040
That is to buy shares in the open market at market prices.

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,360
About 95% of share repurchase are done this way.

78
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,200
The next method is tender offer.

79
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,320
In this case, the firm makes a public offer

80
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,260
to all existing shareholders to buy back

81
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:56,120
a given amount of outstanding shares at a prespecified price

82
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,450
usually 10% to 20% above the current market

83
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:05,880
price, over a given time window, typically 20 days.

84
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,010
The third method is targeted repurchase.

85
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,560
This is done through direct negotiation

86
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,030
with a major shareholder.
