00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,059
PROFESSOR: Our next and last topic on corporate finance

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,630
is risk management.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,730
It goes without saying that firms face all kinds of risks

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,500
from all the items on the asset side, which is business risk,

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,920
and the liability side, which is financial risk.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,580
The basic question we ask here is what, if anything,

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,620
should a firm do to deal with these risks?

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,200
A firm's action in dealing with its risks

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,750
primarily through financial means

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,380
is also referred to as corporate risk management.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,690
Our discussion on corporate risk management

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,370
consists of four parts.

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,910
First, we will provide a conceptual framework

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,060
for risk management in general.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,840
Second, we will consider the firm's risk management policy

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,900
under MM, that is in absence of market frictions.

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,280
Next, we examine how frictions may influence a firm's risk

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,230
management policy.

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,130
Finally, we illustrate how to utilize

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,280
the different financial instruments to implement

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,060
various risk management strategies.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,870
We will start with the simple framework for risk management.

23
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,180
As learned in part 1 of this course,

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,170
we divide risks into two types.

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,060
The first type is factor or market risks.

26
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,380
The factors include commodity prices, interest rates,

27
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,140
exchange rates, other market factors

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,370
such as the stock market, macroeconomy, inflation.

29
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,860
The second type is idiosyncratic risks.

30
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,630
These are risks specific to a firm or a project.

31
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,780
And they can be diversified.

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,120
Depending on the types of risks, the method used to manage them

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,340
is also different.

34
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,600
In general, there are three methods.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,389
For factor risks, the method is hedging,

36
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,370
which involves trading in financial contracts or assets

37
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,430
to reduce or transfer risk.

38
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,550
For idiosyncratic risks, there are two methods.

39
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,260
One is diversification, which involves trading

40
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,350
real assets to reduce risk.

41
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,500
The other is insurance, which involves

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,640
trading insurance or financial contracts to reduce or transfer

43
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,240
risk.

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,570
Potentially, a firm's risk management

45
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,940
can involve all the three methods

46
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,830
in dealing with the different types of risks.

47
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,560
Our analysis, however, will mainly

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,250
focus on how a firm should manage or hedge

49
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,820
its exposures to factor risks.

50
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,420
This is a narrow definition of risk management.

51
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,060
As said above, in general, you should also

52
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,680
include the management of idiosyncratic risks.

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,980
Nonetheless, the basic ideas we develop here

54
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,100
can also be applied to the general situation.

55
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,980
In dealing with factor or market risks,

56
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,400
we can use instruments in the financial market.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,210
Since these instruments involve little transaction costs

58
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,990
and other frictions, the corresponding strategies

59
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,110
are also relatively easy to implement.

60
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,620
For risk management, the two basic questions are,

61
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,180
should a firm hedge its risk?

62
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,080
That is, can hedging increase firm value?

63
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,740
Next, if the firm decides to hedge a particular risk,

64
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,530
how to do it?

65
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,370
We take on these two questions sequentially.
