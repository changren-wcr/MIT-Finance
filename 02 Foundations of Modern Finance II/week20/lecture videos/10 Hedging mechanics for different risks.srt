1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,250
PROFESSOR: We now consider another example

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,370
in interest rate risk management in the context

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,150
of asset liability management.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,170
Suppose an insurance company issues a guaranteed investment

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,390
contract, also called GIC, which are basically zeros.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,930
It has a par value of $10,000, it

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,840
has a maturity of five years, and a guaranteed interest

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,940
rate of 8%.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,000
Therefore, at maturity, the insurance company

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,610
pays the par value plus total interest,

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:40,340
which is $10,000 times 1 plus 8% raised to the power of 5.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,470
Suppose that the insurance company

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,190
chooses to fund this obligation by investing

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,840
in a six-year Treasury bond with a par value of $10,000

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,270
and coupon rate of 8%, trading at par at this point.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:02,020
This implies that the current interest rate is also 8%.

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,569
Therefore, after issuing the GIC,

18
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:09,790
the insurance company incurs a fixed-income liability of L0

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:15,590
equals $10,000 in the form of a five-year zero.

20
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,930
This liability is then funded by a six-year coupon bond

21
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,450
as an asset with 8% coupon rate and a market value of A0--

22
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,480
also equals $10,000.

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,470
If interest rate stays at 8% for the next five years,

24
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,770
the value of the asset will perfectly

25
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,410
match the value of the liability.

26
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:45,610
That is, A5 equals 10,000 times 1.08 to the power of 5,

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,160
and that gives us L5.

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,520
But what if interest rate changes?

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,430
The value of the asset, which is a six-year coupon

30
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,110
bond, and the liability, which is a five-year at zero,

31
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,770
will both change where interest rate changes.

32
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,960
But how much?

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,470
We can easily compute the following.

34
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,760
First, the duration of the liability is DL.

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,790
That equals five years.

36
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,730
The duration of the asset, which is DA--

37
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,560
and that equals 4.9927, also in years.

38
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,690
Since the asset and the liability

39
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,050
have almost the same duration, the liability

40
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,130
remains close to be fully funded for small interest rate

41
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,590
changes.

42
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:41,650
That is, delta A minus delta L equals minus 10,000

43
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,500
times 4.9927--

44
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,450
the duration for the asset--

45
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,180
minus 5-- the duration for the liability--

46
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,660
divide by 1.08-- the yield--

47
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,590
times delta r, the change in the yield.

48
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:05,290
And that's approximately 10,000 times 0.006759 times delta r.

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,090
And that's approximately 0, if delta r is small.

50
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,100
What about large interest rate changes?

51
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,040
The table on the slide shows the changes

52
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,440
in the value of asset and liability.

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,690
The second row gives the values of asset in liability at r

54
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,730
equals 8%.

55
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,020
They are matched.

56
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,690
The third row gives their values when

57
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,910
interest rate increases to 9%.

58
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,080
The match is close, but not perfect.

59
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,650
Clearly, for large interest rate changes,

60
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,470
the mismatch between asset and liability

61
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,080
becomes more substantial.

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,220
In this case, it is $1.79.

63
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,590
This is because, as we have learned

64
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,600
in the fixed-income lecture in part 1 of this course,

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,230
we have different convexities.

66
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,580
We can compute the convexity for the asset and liability,

67
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,260
respectively.

68
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,000
The results are as follows.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,830
The convexity of the liability is CXL.

70
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,300
That equals 12.86.

71
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,495
The convexity for the asset is CXE.

72
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:20,339
That equals 14.02.

73
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,520
Including the second-order terms in values

74
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,840
of asset and liability, we have the following equation.

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,140
Delta A minus delta L is approximately 10,000 times

76
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,640
0.006759 times 1%--

77
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,350
which is the change in yield--

78
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:49,410
plus 10,000 times 14.02 minus 12.86 times 1% yield change

79
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,850
squared.

80
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,840
And that gives us 1.84.

81
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,450
This approximately explains the mismatch

82
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,230
between asset and liability in the previous table.

83
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,650
This example demonstrates two points.

84
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,520
First, for asset liability management,

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,320
we can properly choose the asset to greatly reduce interest rate

86
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,520
risk by matching their modified durations, especially

87
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,710
for small interest rate changes.

88
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,070
Second, for large interest rate movements,

89
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,950
however, matching modified duration still

90
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,090
leaves an interest rate risk of the second order.

91
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,270
To further reduce the second-order risk,

92
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,690
we may need to consider further matching convexities

93
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,170
between the asset and liability.

94
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,530
Interest rate risks can be easily hedged

95
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,530
using interest rate forwards or futures.

96
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,180
We consider, in our last example on risk management.

97
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,230
Suppose that we have $1 billion invested in the portfolio

98
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,840
of government bonds, and are concerned

99
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,430
about volatile interest rates over the next three months.

100
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,390
We have decided to use three months Treasury bonds forwards

101
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,550
or futures to protect the value of this investment.

102
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,860
The modified duration of the bond portfolio is 6.80.

103
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,880
Forwards and futures on 10-year treasury bonds

104
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,000
are actively traded, and we have the following information

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,060
on that.

106
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,090
The T-bond to be delivered has a modified duration of 9.20.

107
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,010
The T-bond pays no coupons over the next three months.

108
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,190
Let the current T-bond price be B10.

109
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:49,860
Each contract delivers $100,000 of face value of T-bonds.

110
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,850
The forward and futures price is F equals $93.50 for face value

111
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,590
of $100.

112
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:07,560
The forward and futures price for one contract is $93,500.

113
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,900
The three-month interest rate is r

114
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,350
equals 1%, which is not annualized.

115
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,620
By no arbitrage, we have the following equation

116
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,890
for the forward and spot prices of the bond.

117
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:31,180
F equals 1 plus r times B10, and that equals 1.01 times B10.

118
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,110
The first question is, in order to hedge the interest rate

119
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,020
risk of our bond portfolio, should we

120
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,930
long or short interest rate forwards and futures?

121
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,280
Of course, short, given that our original position is long

122
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,150
in bonds.

123
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,960
The next question is, how many contracts to short?

124
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,590
We need to properly match modified duration.

125
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,100
Let's work this out.

126
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,700
If yield curve shifts by delta y,

127
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,290
the value of the bond portfolio changes by delta VP.

128
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:13,250
That's approximately minus 6.80 times Vp times delta y.

129
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,830
The current price on the 10-year T-bond changes by delta B10--

130
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:26,470
approximately minus 9.20 times B10 times delta y.

131
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,410
Forward price changes by delta F--

132
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:37,750
approximately minus 1.01 times 9.20 times B10 times delta y.

133
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:45,140
And that equals minus 9.20 times F times delta y.

134
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,710
Gains and losses on the forward contract

135
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,500
are realized in three months.

136
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,800
Matching the gain/loss in present value terms,

137
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,470
we have the following equation--

138
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:06,500
minus the number of contracts times 1/1.01 times 93,500 times

139
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,410
9.20 times delta y--

140
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,220
the left-hand side-- equals minus $1 billion--

141
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,600
that's the portfolio value--

142
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,760
times 6.80-- its modified duration-- times delta y.

143
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,100
That's the right-hand side.

144
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,800
Therefore, the number of contracts to short

145
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,860
is given by the following equation.

146
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,110
The number of contracts should equal to 1.01 times 1 billion

147
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:41,570
divided by 93,500, then times 6.80 divided by 9.20.

148
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:47,610
That gives us 7,905.14.

149
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,580
Hence, we need to short 7,905 contracts.

150
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,290
One important point to note is that, in this hedging strategy,

151
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,630
the hedge ratio is based on the modified

152
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,740
durations of the portfolio and the hedging vehicle.

153
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,480
Both of them will change over time.

154
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,170
Therefore, we need to rebalance the hedge accordingly.
