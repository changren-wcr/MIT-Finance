00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,120
PROFESSOR: The dividend puzzle has several aspects.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,840
First, we know that at the corporate level,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,900
dividends are not tax-exempt, while interests are.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,910
At the personal level, dividends are

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,390
taxed at the same rate as interests, at least

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,860
before 2003.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,300
Therefore, why pay dividends when interest payments

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,500
are tax-exempt?

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,100
Why pay cash dividend instead of share repurchase?

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,650
Possible explanations include transaction costs,

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,900
such as selling small amounts of shares is costly,

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,390
the signaling hypotheses, the free cash flow hypotheses.

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,880
We'll briefly explore these possibilities--

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,220
in particular, the last two.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,140
The signaling hypotheses for dividends goes as follows.

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,500
There is asymmetric information between the market

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,660
and firm's managers.

18
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,170
In particular, managers know about the prospects

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,110
of their own firms, good or bad.

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,310
But the market does not have this information.

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,910
In this situation, firms with good prospects

22
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,330
want to reveal this information to the market.

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,080
By paying dividends, which is costly,

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,500
they are signalling this information to the market.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,850
Firms with bad prospects, however,

26
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,200
cannot afford to mimic the good firms.

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,330
For example, if future earnings are low,

28
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,600
which is more likely for bad firms,

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,630
they will need to raise outside funds for good investments,

30
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,520
which incurs transaction or information costs, or even

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,600
forego these projects.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,280


33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,070
The financial market does interpret

34
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,150
unanticipated dividend changes as signals about the firm's

35
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,250
future prospects.

36
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,400
For example, on average, the stock price

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,630
drops 3.7% for large dividend cuts

38
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,400
and rises 1.3% for large dividend increases.

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,490
Although the second hypotheses is intuitive,

40
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,040
it faces some questions.

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,880
For example, given how costly dividends

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,360
are, at least to shareholders, why don't firms

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,730
use repurchase to signal?

44
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,470
Also, given that firms don't change their dividends often,

45
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,550
how can dividend policy be an effective signal?

46
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,810
If anything, can dividends be a signal about risk?

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,500
Another possible explanation for a firm's dividend policy

48
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,400
is the so-called free cash flow hypotheses.

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,560
Its basic argument goes as follows.

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,080
First, excess cash can lead to agency problems,

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,930
such as empire building-- that is,

52
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,380
managers take on projects not in the best interest

53
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,180
of shareholders--

54
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,590
or perks.

55
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,400
Second, paying out excess cash prevent

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,620
wasting money on bad projects.

57
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,040
In particular, dividend is a way to get money

58
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,250
out of manager's hands back to shareholders.

59
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,210
Despite its appeal, there are, however, a few caveats

60
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,680
about this hypotheses.

61
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,270
For example, dividends are discretionary--

62
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,480
hence, not a strong mechanism to get money out.

63
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,770
Interest payment on debt is a stronger commitment.

64
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,670
The firm has to pay its debt holders.

65
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,540
Nevertheless, investors do expect dividends to be smooth.

66
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,450
The discussion above also suggests

67
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,070
that frictions, like asymmetric information and agency cost,

68
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,900
can also contribute to the other corporate financial decisions,

69
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,860
such as capital budgeting and financing.

70
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,490
The underlying mechanisms are similar in spirit

71
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,960
to the ones we have discussed above for payout.

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,080
For example, leverage can also be a tool

73
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,590
to mitigate agency problems, like mentioned above,

74
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,829
in addition to its tax benefit.

75
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,010
To summarize, frictions, like asymmetric information

76
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:26,840
and agency costs, are prevalent in corporate finance.

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,540
It is quite compelling to think that they

78
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,880
can have significant impact on the firm's financial decisions.

79
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,340
It's also fairly easy to come up with various hypotheses,

80
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,390
like the ones discussed above, to explain or predict

81
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,290
firm behavior.

82
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,310
Nonetheless, these hypotheses also have their challenges.

83
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,970
For example, is their impact significant enough

84
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,510
to explain the first-order phenomena, like dividend

85
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,700
or capital structure?

86
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,940
Here, we are talking about a substantial fraction

87
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,620
of the firm's total value that can be gained or lost.

88
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,340
If the answer is yes, then what is preventing firms

89
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,170
from coming up with effective ways,

90
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:21,490
such as proper incentives for the managers, to overcome them?

91
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,380
We leave these issues as more advanced topics

92
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,300
beyond the scope of this course.
