1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,180
PROFESSOR: Interest rate is another important market

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,220
risk firms face.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,890
When interest rates change over time,

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,190
the discount rates on most assets also change,

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,330
which will then change the values of most assets.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,640
We now develop the basic techniques

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,460
in managing this risk using the tools we

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,860
have developed in our Fixed Income lecture

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,960
in part 1 of this course.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,410
To be simple, we will start with a fixed income position

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,660
as the original position.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,060
This can be an actual fixed income asset

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,990
or a stream of safe cash flows.

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,230
This position will be exposed to the interest rate risk

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,110
as interest rates change over time.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,430
To hedge this risk, we can take another fixed income position

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,050
to offset the interest rate risk of the original position.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,260
The goal is to reduce the interest rate risk

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,040
of the total on that position.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,550
For tractability, we will assume a flat term structure

21
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,350
for interest rates.

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,740
Let's consider a bond portfolio which

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,970
consists of nA units of Bond A and nB units of Bond B.

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,210
The data of Bond A and Bond B are given

25
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,550
in the table on the slide.

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,280
As shown by the second row in the table,

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,630
Bond A has a price of BA, a duration of DA,

28
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,020
and a modified duration of MDA.

29
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,630
The third row gives Bond B's price BB, duration DB,

30
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,650
and modified duration MDB, respectively.

31
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,190
As we have learned in part 1 of this course,

32
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,030
the modified duration measures the interest rate risk

33
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,980
of each bond.

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,840
The value of the portfolio is then

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,610
given by VP equals VA plus VB.

36
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:06,860
That equals nA times BA plus nB times BB.

37
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,340
When interest rate changes, the value of the portfolio

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,590
changes as follows.

39
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:18,620
Delta VP equals delta VA plus delta VB,

40
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,590
which reflects the changes in value of each

41
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,090
of the pieces in the portfolio.

42
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,830
That can be written as nA times delta BA

43
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,690
plus nB times delta BB.

44
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:42,130
That equals minus VA times MDA plus VB times MDB.

45
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,440
We then have the modified duration

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,380
for the portfolio, which is given by MDP equals VA divided

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,450
by VA plus VB times MDA plus VB divided

48
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,620
by VA plus VB times MDB.

49
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,990
It's simply the value weighted average

50
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,960
of the modified duration of the different pieces

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,970
in the portfolio.

52
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,970
MDP, then, gives the measure of interest rate

53
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,860
risk for the whole portfolio.

54
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,190
We can apply the above interest rate risk analytics

55
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:21,200
to construct hedging strategies against interest rate risks.

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,590
We illustrate the method using a simple example.

57
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,040
Suppose that you have a long position

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,980
in a four-year government bond and you

59
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,980
want to use a three-year government bond to hedge

60
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,450
the interest rate risk.

61
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,550
The data on the two bonds are given in a table on the slide.

62
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,390
Given in the second row, the three-year bond has a yield

63
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,100
to maturity of 10%, a duration of 2.75,

64
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,670
and a modified duration of 2.50.

65
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,820
Given in the third row, the four-year bond has a yield

66
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,590
to maturity of 10%--

67
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,730
same as the three-year bond since the yield curve is flat--

68
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:09,400
a duration of 3.52, and modified duration of 3.20.

69
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,050
In order to hedge the interest rate

70
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,380
risk of a long position in four-year bonds,

71
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,040
we need to short, or sell, three-year bonds.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,380
The question is, how much?

73
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,920
For each dollar worth of the four-year bond,

74
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,980
let's short delta dollars of the three-year bond

75
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,850
such that the total portfolio has zero volatility, which

76
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,640
means modified duration here.

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,120
This gives us the first equation on the slide,

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,810
that is MD4 minus delta times MD3 equals 0.

79
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,270
Solving for the hedge ratio delta,

80
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,970
we have delta equals MD4 divided by MD3, that is,

81
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,400
3.20 divided by 2.50.

82
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,910
And that gives us 1.28.

83
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,950
This implies that for each dollar of the four-year bond

84
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,890
we need to short $1.28 of the three-year bond.

85
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,620
For the hedge portfolio, the interest rate risk

86
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,810
is close to zero.

87
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,330
The table on the slide shows what

88
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,700
happens when interest rate increases by 0.1%.

89
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,000
The first column describes the different positions,

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,280
and the second column gives the change in their values.

91
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,820
The second row is for a long position

92
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,160
of $1,000 in a four-year bond, our original position.

93
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,110
The change in its value is minus $3.20.

94
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,810
The third row is for the short position

95
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,020
in the three-year bond of $1,280, the hedging position.

96
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,260
The change in its value is plus $3.20.

97
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,120
The last row describes the net or the hedged position.

98
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,510
Its value changed by 0 to the first order of yield change.

99
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,260
Indeed, we have a perfect hedge to the first order

100
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,650
of interest rate changes.
