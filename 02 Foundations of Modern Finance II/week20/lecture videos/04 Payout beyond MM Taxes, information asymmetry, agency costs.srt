PROFESSOR: The MM insight about payout irrelevance

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,860
also helps us to avoid fallacies and illusions

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,530
about payout policy.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,830
As an example, let's consider the bird-in-the-hand

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,690
hypothesis.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,370
It argues that dividends are safer than future payments,

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,650
hence paying dividends puts money

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,060
in the hands of shareholders and will increase from value.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,610
Is this correct?

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,820
Since both current and future payments are properly

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,680
valued by the market, the timing should not matter.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,740
Having it in your account versus the firm's account

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,940
should not make a difference.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,560
But if it's about potential misuse of cash

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,510
by the managers, which is a friction, then you may.

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,520
We will return to this issue a little bit later.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,600
This example also shows that the MM insight leads

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
us to ask the right question.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,090
How does a change in payout policy

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,870
alter the size of the pie?

21
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,870
This happens only when there are frictions.

22
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,850
The main frictions include taxes, asymmetric information,

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,890
agency problems.

24
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,560
We will consider them one at a time.

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,090
The first friction we consider is tax.

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,990
It's often the case that for different payoffs from equity,

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,580
like dividends and capital gain, they are taxed differently.

28
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,590
In particular, shareholders must pay taxes on dividends.

29
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,290
And they also pay taxes on capital gains

30
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,010
when they sell their shares, at least in the US.

31
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,770
Dividends are typically taxed at a higher

32
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,360
rate than capital gains.

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,650
Long-term investors can defer capital gains tax indefinitely

34
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,680
by not selling.

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,620
Tax code on dividends and capital gain

36
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,330
varies substantially across countries and over time.

37
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,570
The table on the slide shows the tax rates

38
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:18,960
on capital gains and dividends in the US from 1971 to 2018.

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,270
The first column gives the different time

40
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,050
windows during which the tax rates stay constant.

41
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,590
The second column gives the tax rate on capital gains

42
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,960
during these time windows.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,290
It does change over time quite a bit.

44
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,370
The range is between 15% from 2003 to 2012 and 35%

45
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,060
from 1971 to 1978, which is quite substantial.

46
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,440
Since 2013, it's 20%, which is significant,

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,630
but at a relatively low level.

48
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,070
The third column in the table gives the marginal tax

49
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,840
rate on dividends.

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,910
Here, marginal means the highest tax bracket.

51
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,560
We first observe that there is a wide range in the tax

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,680
rate on dividends over this time period,

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,630
from 70% at the highest level to 15% at the lowest level

54
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,970
during this period of 48 years.

55
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,260
Next, there is an overall decreasing trend.

56
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,480
It was 70% in the 1970s, which is very high.

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,590
It dropped to around 40% in 1990s

58
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:42,785
and further decreased to 15% during 2003 to 2012.

59
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:47,070
It became 20% in 2013.

60
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,030
There is, however, no reason to suggest that this trend will

61
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,870
not be reversed.

62
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,460
Third, up until recently, there is a large spread

63
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,990
between the tax rates on capital gains and dividends.

64
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,020
Most of the time over this period, dividends

65
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,340
are taxed at a much higher rate than capital gains.

66
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,410
Only since 2003 the two tax rates became the same.

67
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,050
Given the tax environment, we can

68
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,210
arrive at some simple and intuitive predictions.

69
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,030
First, when the tax rate on dividends

70
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,330
is higher than the tax rate on capital gains,

71
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,910
shareholders will pay lower taxes

72
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,200
if the firm uses share repurchase rather than dividend

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,800
to pay out.

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,960
The tax savings will then increase

75
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,590
the value of the firm which uses share repurchase instead

76
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,800
of dividends.

77
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,580
Second, when a tax rate on dividends

78
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,000
is higher than a tax rate on capital gains,

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,450
the optimal payout policy is not to pay dividends.

80
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,520
The predictions above are broadly

81
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,760
consistent with the data we have seen.

82
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,270
Dividend payments are declining on average

83
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,920
over the past 30 years, while the user repurchases

84
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,570
has increased.

85
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,220
However, they cannot fully explain why firms were paying

86
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,710
dividends, even when a tax rate on them was very high.

87
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,480
This suggests that other factors may also be at play.

88
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,520
The figure on this slide provides

89
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,520
more empirical background for this issue.

90
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,360
The x-axis shows the time span from 1975 to 2015,

91
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,880
a total of 40 years.

92
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,140
The y-axis shows the percentage of share repurchases

93
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,320
in total payout.

94
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,240
Over this time period, there is a substantial increase

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,540
in the use of share repurchase in payout.

96
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:03,460
Its share in total payout started at below 5% in 1975.

97
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:10,090
By 1997, its share has exceeded 50%.

98
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,480
After the cut in dividend tax in 2003,

99
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,940
the trend has more or less stabilized.

100
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,850
The share of repurchase in total payout

101
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,590
has been fluctuating around 60% since then.

102
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,260
Dividends, however, still take up 40% of the total payout.

103
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,550
This general empirical pattern under the current code

104
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,580
presents a so-called dividend puzzle.

105
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,520
Why do firms continue to pay dividends

106
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,835
despite their tax disadvantage?
