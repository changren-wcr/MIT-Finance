00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,300
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will illustrate

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,010
how, in a perfect capital market,

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,990
payout policy affects share price.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,560
We will consider two major types of payouts--

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,920
dividends and share repurchases.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,590
Consider a firm whose board of directors

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,620
just announced a cash dividend of $100 million

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,240
to be paid tomorrow.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,380
For valuation purposes, ignore this one-day period.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,080
After this payout the firm will have assets

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,540
worth $1,000 million and 10 million shares outstanding.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,180
The firm's cost of capital is 10%.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,970
Ignore corporate and personal taxes.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,850
Also, assume that the firm has no debt.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,440
What is the firm's share price before the dividend is paid?

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,260
What is the firm's share price after the dividend payment?

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,670
In other words, what is the ex-dividend price?

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,140
Suppose that, instead of paying out

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,690
all cash as a single dividend at once,

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,080
the board announces that it will pay quarterly dividends

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,480
with a first dividend of $25 million

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,618
to be paid the day after the announcement.

23
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:08,910
What is the firm's share price after the first dividend

24
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,050
payment in this case?

25
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,290
Assume that unpaid earnings are reinvested back

26
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,810
into the firm's operations.

27
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,140
Currently, the firm has $100 million in cash,

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,061
and its assets are worth $1,000 million, or $1 billion.

29
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:29,970
Since it has no debt and 10 million shares outstanding,

30
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,230
the current share price must be $110.

31
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,250
Next, let's compute the ex-dividend share price.

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,460
First, note that per share amount of dividend

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,300
is $100 million divided by 10 million shares outstanding,

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,470
which gives us $10 per share.

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,840
After the payout, the current share price

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,870
is reduced by the amount of per share dividend.

37
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:00,030
Therefore, the ex-dividend share price will be $100.

38
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,860
What will be the share price if, instead

39
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,110
of paying all cash in one dividend payment,

40
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,330
the firm pays out only a quarter of it, in other words,

41
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,199
$25 million out of $100 million?

42
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,460
In this case, the per share dividend amount would be $2.50.

43
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,530
If the remaining cash of $75 million

44
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,660
is reinvested back into the firm's operations

45
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,390
and paid out later, the present value of this cash

46
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,840
would not change.

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,950
In other words, it would still be worth $75 million.

48
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,020
The reason for this is that this cash

49
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,990
will earn 10% return, which is the rate of return

50
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,760
on the firm's assets.

51
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,380
To find its present value, we would

52
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,570
have to discount the future value back

53
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,760
at a 10% discount rate, which would give us $75 million.

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,550
If, on the other hand, this cash will remain uninvested and paid

55
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,860
out later, the present value of this cash

56
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,040
would be lower due to the time value of money.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,850
This implies that the ex-dividend share price in this

58
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,108
case would be $107.50.

59
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,150
Suppose that the day after the quarterly dividend

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,800
payment, the firm announces it will buy back $21.5 million

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,090
worth of shares to be implemented the following day.

62
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,790
How many shares will it buy back?

63
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,450
What will be the share price after the repurchase?

64
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,030
To find the number of shares that the firm will buy back,

65
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,150
we take the total dollar amount of buyback and divide it

66
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,700
by the share price, which is $107.50.

67
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,730
This gives us 200,000 shares.

68
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,010
To find the share price, let's first

69
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,200
find the value of the firm and the number of shares

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,660
after the buyback.

71
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,180
The original firm value was $1.1 billion,

72
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,060
and we paid out $25 million in dividends

73
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,320
and repurchased $21.5 million worth of shares.

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,400
This implies that the current firm value is $1,053.5 million.

75
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,350
The original number of shares outstanding was 10 million,

76
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,147
and we repurchased 200,000.

77
00:03:57,147 --> 00:03:59,480
This means that the current number of shares outstanding

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,420
is 9.8 million.

79
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,040
To find the share price, we divide

80
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,980
the firm value by the number of shares outstanding.

81
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,450
Recall that this firm has no debt.

82
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,033
And, hence, the value of equity equals

83
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,930
to the value of the firm.

84
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,330
We see that the share price after the repurchase equals

85
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,029
to $107.50.

86
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,519
We see that there is no change in the share price,

87
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,610
precisely because the value of cash outflow from the firm

88
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,680
due to buyback is equal to the cash

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,410
inflow in the form of surrendered shares.

90
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,740
Mechanically, claims to future dividends for the existing

91
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,470
shareholders have risen in the amount that

92
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,560
exactly compensates for the cash released to repurchase shares.
