PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,460
show an example of how insurance companies protect themselves

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,100
against changes in interest rates.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,060
This example is similar to how pension funds, endowment funds,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,090
and other financial institutions manage their liabilities as

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,079
well.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,090
Consider a life insurance company,

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,650
which has existing liabilities that

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,410
obligate it to pay out $5 million per year

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,550
for the next 10 years.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,090
Assume that the term structure of interest rates is flat

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,580
and the current interest rate is 2%.

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,520
The insurance company would like to invest in safe government

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,600
bonds in such a way that makes it immune to fluctuations

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,550
in interest rates.

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,090
It considers 1-year and 10-year treasury STRIPS.

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,950
Construct an investment portfolio

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,570
for the insurance company that hedges the interest rate risk.

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,970
Let's first find the current value of liabilities.

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,850
Liabilities of this insurance company

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,910
represent a 10 year annuity.

21
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,040
We can use the present value of annuity formula

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,900
to find its value.

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,360
It equals to $44.91 million.

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,550
Next, let's find the duration of liabilities.

25
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,590
Using the tools we learned in the first part of this course,

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,110
we find that the duration of liabilities is 5.34 years.

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,720
To hedge liabilities, we want to allocate

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,230
funds across 1-year and 10-year STRIPS in such a way

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,450
that duration of the portfolio matches

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,970
the duration of liabilities.

31
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,490
Let's introduce some notation.

32
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,390
Let's note by the V1, the value invested in 1-year STRIPS

33
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,590
and by V10, the value invested in 10-year STRIPS.

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,960
The hedging portfolio should have the following two

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,370
properties.

36
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,650
First, its value should equal to the current value

37
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,150
of liabilities.

38
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,760
And second, the duration of the portfolio

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,730
should be the same as the duration of liabilities.

40
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,820
This gives us the following two equations,

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,300
V1 plus V10 equals to VL.

42
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,570
And the duration of asset portfolio,

43
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,320
which is the weighted average of durations

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,900
of 1-year and 10-year STRIPS should equal

45
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,630
to the duration of liabilities.

46
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,690
Plugging in the numbers for the value of liabilities,

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,180
the duration of 1-year and 10 year STRIPS

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,340
and the duration of liabilities, we

49
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,460
get the system of two equations with two unknowns.

50
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,710
Solving these two equations, we find

51
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,720
that V1 equals to $23.27 million and V10

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,320
equals the $21.64 million.

53
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,170
Therefore, to immunize itself against changes

54
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,630
in interest rates, the insurance company

55
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,560
should purchase $23.27 million worth of 1-year STRIPS

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,390
and $21.64 million worth of 10-year STRIPS.

57
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,600
Note that since we're matching only duration,

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,120
this hedge immunizes the insurance company

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,960
only against small parallel shifts in the yield curve.

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,610
Therefore, this hedge is not perfect.
