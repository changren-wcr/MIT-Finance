00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,220
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,680
consider an example of corporate risk hedging

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,410
with derivative securities.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,080
Consider a market with two possible states a year

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,040
from now--

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,750
good or bad.

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,480
In the good state, the return on the market portfolio

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,710
will be 10%.

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,010
And in the bad state, it will be negative 20%.

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,460
The one-year risk-free rate is 5%.

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,850
A biotechnology startup in Cambridge, Massachusetts

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,680
works on a new vaccine delivery technology.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,240
Next year, this technology will be sold to Moderna.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,040
If the market is in the good state,

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,400
the startup will generate $80 million in cash flow

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,110
on this sale.

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,510
If the market, however, is in the bad state,

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,590
the cash flow will only be $20 million.

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,320
The startup is considering borrowing $15 million

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,990
to fund the development.

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,150
If the startup fails to pay the loan back,

22
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,420
it faces bankruptcy costs of $5 million.

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,400
In the event of default, these costs

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,620
will reduce the value of the remaining assets

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,340
and therefore, the payout to debt holders.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,740
Suppose that the loan is issued at par

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,860
and that the interest is due at maturity.

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,130
You are hired as a financial advisor to the startup.

29
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,970
Your goal is to advise on the best financing arrangement.

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,690
Assume that the tax rate is 25%.

31
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,970
First, let's find the value of this firm

32
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,330
if it is 100% equity financed.

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,330
The after-tax cash flow in year 1 in the good state

34
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,410
is $60 million.

35
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,468
And in the bad state it is $15 million.

36
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:39,280
To find the present value after-tax cash flows,

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,360
let's first find risk-neutral probabilities.

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,300
The risk-neutral probability of the good state is 83.3%,

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,840
and risk-neutral probability of the bad state is 16.7%.

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,723
Knowing the risk-neutral probabilities,

41
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:55,140
we can find the value of this firm

42
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,780
if it is 100% equity financed.

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,715
This value is $50 million.

44
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:03,510


45
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,699
Now let's find the value of this firm if it borrows $15 million.

46
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,060
First, let's find the promised yield on this loan.

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,400
We can write down the following equation.

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,410
The borrowed amount, which is $15 million,

49
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,410
has to equal to the expected value of the payoff

50
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,960
from this loan under the risk-neutral measure discounted

51
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,460
to present at the risk-free rate.

52
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,400
This equals to the risk-neutral probability

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,050
of the good state, which is 83.3% times the total payoff

54
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,330
from the loan in the good state, which

55
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,730
equals to the principal of $15 million

56
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,090
plus interest, which equals to the promised yield,

57
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,000
plus the risk-neutral probability of the bad state,

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,800
which is 16.7%, times the payoff from the bond in the bad state,

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,760
which equals the total value of assets in the bad state, $15

60
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,180
million, minus the losses of $5 million

61
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,170
that the firm would incur in the event of default.

62
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,818
Solving this equation, we get 12.67%.

63
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,590
If this loan is issued at par, the interest rate on this loan

64
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,970
would be 12.67%.

65
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,680
And its face value would be $15 million.

66
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,690
Knowing the interest rate on this loan,

67
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,970
we can find the present value of interest tax shields.

68
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,840
They equal to the expected value of tax shields generated

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,690
by this loan under the risk neutral measure discounted

70
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,880
to present at the risk-free rate.

71
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,750
Importantly, note that this loan generates tax shields only

72
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,060
in the up state, because in the down state,

73
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,370
the firm defaults and does not pay interest,

74
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,640
and therefore, does not get the tax shield.

75
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,710
Hence, the present value of tax shields

76
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,200
equals to the risk-neutral probability

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,600
of the up state times the tax rate

78
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,910
times the interest rate times the face

79
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,390
value of this loan divided by 1 plus the risk-free rate.

80
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,748
This gives us $0.38 million.

81
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:57,620
Next, let's find the present value

82
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,080
of financial distress costs.

83
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,170
They equal to the expected value of financial distress costs

84
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,990
under the risk-neutral measure discounted to present

85
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,970
at the risk-free rate.

86
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,180
Since the firm defaults on the loan only in the down state,

87
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,190
the present value of distress costs

88
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,830
is the risk-neutral probability of the down state

89
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,709
times the dollar value of distress costs, which

90
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,720
is $5 million.

91
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,190
This gives us $0.79 million.

92
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,260
Putting this all together we can find

93
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,420
the value of the levered firm.

94
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,760
It equals to the value of the unlevered firm

95
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,890
plus the present value of tax shields,

96
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,718
minus the present value of distress costs.

97
00:04:37,718 --> 00:04:40,010
We find that the value of the firm if it takes the loan

98
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,310
is $49.58 million.

99
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,440
We see that this value is lower than the value

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,460
of the unlevered firm, which was $50 million.

101
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,390
The reason for this is that the present value of distress costs

102
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,500
outweighs the present value of interest tax shields.

103
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,290
Based on this analysis, we conclude that the firm

104
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,610
should not take the loan.

105
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,170


106
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,750
CFO of the startup considers the possibility

107
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,483
of hedging default risk in order to avoid bankruptcy costs.

108
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:12,900
She approached the investment bank

109
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,440
Lazard, which offered to sell a put option that

110
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,580
pays $750,000 in the bad state of the economy

111
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,010
and nothing in the good state.

112
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,380
Assuming that the option will be fairly priced,

113
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,400
what would you advise the biotech startup to do?

114
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,330
Having additional $750,000 in the bad state effectively

115
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,730
allows the startup to avoid default

116
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,330
and to borrow $15 million at the risk-free rate.

117
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,030
With this hedge, the startup has enough funds

118
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,910
to pay both the principal, which is $15 million,

119
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,860
and the interest, 5% times $15 million,

120
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,650
which is $750,000 in both good and bad states.

121
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,980
So let's quantify the costs and benefits of this hedging

122
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,140
strategy.

123
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,180
The cost of this hedging strategy

124
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,710
is the price of the put option, which we have to pay to Lazard.

125
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,470
Assuming that this option would be fairly priced,

126
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,200
its price equals to the present value of the payoff

127
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,600
under the risk control measure discounted to present

128
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,830
at the risk-free rate.

129
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,445
This gives us $0.12 million.

130
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,750
The benefit of this hedging strategy

131
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,210
is the fact that we avoid bankruptcy costs

132
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,020
and generate interest tax shield in both states of the world.

133
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,630
The tax shield equals to the tax rate times the risk-free rate,

134
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,260
because with the hedge, as long as it is risk-free,

135
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,210
ties the principal amount.

136
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,190
This tax shield is risk-free and hence, we

137
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,100
discount it to present at the risk-free rate.

138
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,680
We find that the present value of tax shield is $0.18 million.

139
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,300
We see that the benefits outweigh the costs.

140
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,720
And therefore, the startup should take the loan

141
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,580
and buy the put.

142
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,880
By doing this, the startup avoids default,

143
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,430
and its value becomes $50 million

144
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,020
plus the present value of tax shields, which is $0.18 million

145
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,340
minus the cost of hedging, which is $0.12 million.

146
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,500
The firm value is therefore $50.06 million.

147
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,000
