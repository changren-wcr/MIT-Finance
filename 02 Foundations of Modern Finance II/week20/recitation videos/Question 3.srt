00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,190
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,200
show an example of how an endowment

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,470
fund can hedge an interest rate risk of its fixed income

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,540
portfolio.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,090
Consider an endowment fund which owns a fixed income

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,720
portfolio consisting of two US Treasury STRIPS.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,620
It has 1 million units of STRIP A and 1.5 million units

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,920
of STRIP B. The fund would like to construct

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,900
a hedge for the interest rate risk using Treasury STRIP C.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,110
The following table shows the duration of the three bonds.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,450
Bond A has a duration of four years.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,700
Bond B has a duration of eight years.

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,640
And bond C has a duration of seven years.

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,780
We will denote prices of the three bonds by PA, PB, and PC,

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,670
respectively.

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,437
All STRIPS have a principal of $100.

17
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:49,770
We will assume that the term structure of interest rates

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,690
is flat and that the current interest rate is 2%.

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,700
We will answer the following questions:

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,870
what is the modified duration of the portfolio?

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,870
Using bond C, construct a hedge to protect

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,030
the value of the portfolio against parallel shifts

23
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,650
in interest rates.

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,330
How many units of bond C should we go long or short?

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,650
Is the hedge constructed in part B a perfect hedge?

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,690
Let's start by computing the modified

27
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,040
duration of the endowment fund's portfolio.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,910
Recall that the duration of a portfolio

29
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,530
is a weighted average of durations

30
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,990
of assets in the portfolio.

31
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,810
Therefore, to find the duration of the portfolio,

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,580
we first need to find the total value invested in bonds A

33
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,250
and B, and then, take the weighted average of durations

34
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,810
of bonds A and B.

35
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,560
We are given the face value of each bond

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,030
and we know that interest rates at all maturities are 2%.

37
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,450
This allows us to compute prices of bonds A and B.

38
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,290
We see that the price of bond A is $92.38

39
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,240
and the price of bond B is $85.35.

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,280
The value of the portfolio equals

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,180
to the number of units of each bond, times their prices.

42
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,880
We find that the value of the endowment fund's portfolio

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,220
is $220.41 million.

44
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,710
Now we can compute the duration of the portfolio.

45
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,900
Recall the duration of bond A is four years

46
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,530
and duration of bond B is eight years.

47
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,510
The duration of the portfolio equals

48
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,480
to the total value invested in bond A, which

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,030
is 1 million units times the bond price

50
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,810
92.38, divided by the total value of the portfolio,

51
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,480
multiplied by the duration, which is 4.

52
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,180
Plus the total value invested in bond B,

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,990
which is 1.5 million units times the bond price

54
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,560
85.35, divided by the total value of the portfolio,

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
multiplied by the duration, which is 8.

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,470
We find that the duration of the portfolio is 6.32 years.

57
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,170
To compute modified duration of the portfolio,

58
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,930
recall that the modified duration equals to the Macaulay

59
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,940
duration, which we just computed,

60
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,310
divided by 1 plus yield.

61
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,310
Recommend you to review week four of the first part

62
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,870
of the course.

63
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,120
In our case, modified duration equals

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,120
to 6.32 divided by 1 plus 2%, which equals to 6.2 years.

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,930


66
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,210
Next, let's construct the hedge.

67
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,730
Let's denote our position in bond C by nc.

68
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,890
If this number is positive, we go long.

69
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,950
If this number is negative, we go short.

70
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,430
To hedge against parallel and small shifts in interest rates,

71
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,740
we need to establish a position in bond C

72
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,700
so that the duration of our portfolio is 0.

73
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,430
Let's denote by H the new portfolio,

74
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,260
which in addition to bonds A and B, will have bond C in it.

75
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,310
Let's add the duration of portfolio H to 0.

76
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,330
Solving this equation for nc, we get negative Dp, which

77
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,750
is the duration of portfolio P times VP, which

78
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,910
is the value of portfolio P divided

79
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,432
by PC, which is the price of bond

80
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:12,110
C times DC, which is the duration of bond C.

81
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,130
Recall that the duration of portfolio P is 6.32.

82
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,300
The value of portfolio P is $220.41 million.

83
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,320
The price of bond C is $87.06 and its duration

84
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,600
is seven years.

85
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,870
This gives us negative 2.29 million units.

86
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,530
Therefore, in order to construct a hedge portfolio

87
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,760
with zero duration, we need to short 2.29 million units

88
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,970
of bond C.

89
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,520
Is this a perfect hedge?

90
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,190
Duration matching allows us to hedge

91
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,660
only small and parallel shifts in the yield curve.

92
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,950
Due to convexity of bond prices, large changes in interest rates

93
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,700
will not be perfectly hedged with just duration matching.

94
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,820
We would also need to match convexity.

95
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,780
Also, in practice, interest rates at different maturities

96
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,440
may be affected differently by economic events.

97
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,020
This would affect prices of bonds of different maturities

98
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,190
differently, which would affect the quality of our hedge.

99
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,725
Therefore, this is not a perfect hedge.

100
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:20,225
