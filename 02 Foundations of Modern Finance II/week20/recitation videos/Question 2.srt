PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,060
consider an example of hedging commodity price risk.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,670
Cartier, the maker of fine jewelry

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,050
uses 76,000 of troy ounces of silver per year

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,210
in production of their jewelry and would

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,840
like to hedge its price risk for next year.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,060
The current price of silver is $22.35 per troy ounce.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,970
Cartier is considering two hedging strategies.

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,320
First, it can enter into a one year forward contract with BNP

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:39,510
Paribas for 76,000 troy ounces at a price of $25.70 per ounce.

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,060
Second, it can trade silver futures

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,670
on Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,490
The current price of a one year futures contract is $25.25.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,450
The contract unit is 5,000 troy ounces.

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,060
The picture on the right shows contract details

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,260
for silver futures.

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,980


17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,250
We will answer the following questions:

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,770
assuming that Cartier does not hedge,

19
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,890
what would be its cost of silver consumption if silver price

20
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,620
increases to $23.00?

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,060
What if the silver price increases to $27.00?

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,550
Suppose that you enter into a 1-year forward contract

23
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,740
with BNP Paribas.

24
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,000
What is the total cost of your silver consumption in year one?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,910
Is this a perfect hedge?

26
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,990
Suppose that you use futures for your hedging needs.

27
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,630
Assuming that you cannot buy fractions of standard

28
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,310
contracts, how many contracts you need to buy or sell?

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,830
Is this a perfect hedge?

30
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,470
Let's first see what would be our silver consumption

31
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,430
costs in year one, if we do not hedge.

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,090
If in year one, the silver price is $23.00,

33
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,410
our costs would be $1.75 million.

34
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,200
If in year one, the silver prices $27.00,

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,120
our costs would be $2.05 million.

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,729
Next, let's compute Cartier silver consumption

37
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,280
costs, if it enters into a Forward contract

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,920
agreement with BNP Paribas.

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,480
The contract price is $25.70 per ounce of silver.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,780
Therefore, the total cost is 25.70 times 76,000 ounces,

41
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,010
which equals to $1.95 million.

42
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,990
By entering into this forward agreement,

43
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,420
Cartier fully hedges its silver price

44
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,250
a risk over the next year.

45
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,240
Therefore, this is a perfect hedge.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,150
Let's compute Cartier's silver consumption costs,

47
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,750
if it buys silver futures on CME.

48
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,860
First, let's determine how many contracts we need to buy.

49
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,030
Recall that the standard contract is for 5,000 ounces.

50
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,320
Therefore, we usually need 15.2 contracts,

51
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,490
which we computed by dividing 76,000 by 5,000.

52
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,470
Since we cannot buy fractions of a contract,

53
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,770
we will buy 15 contracts.

54
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,910
This will guarantee the price of 75,000 ounces and the remaining

55
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,300
1,000 ounces Cartier would need to buy at the market

56
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,550
price in year one.

57
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,410
Let's now compute Cartier's silver consumption costs,

58
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,640
if he buys 15 futures contracts.

59
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,940
If in year one, the price of silver is $23.00,

60
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:34,710
our costs would be $25.25 times 75,000 ounces plus $23.00 times

61
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,570
1,000 ounces, which gives us $1.917 million.

62
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,950
If in year one, the price of silver is $27.00,

63
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:51,270
our cost would be $25.25 times 75,000 ounces plus $27.00 times

64
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:58,250
1,000 ounces, which gives us $1.921 million.

65
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,520
Based on this analysis, we see that we cannot achieve

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,360
a perfect hedge with futures contracts.

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,820
The reason for this is that we cannot buy a fraction

68
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,390
of a contract, which leaves 1,000 ounces of our silver

69
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,910
needs exposed to the silver price risk.

70
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,660
However, most of our consumption needs

71
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,890
(75,000 out of 76,000 ounces) is hedged.

72
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,440
Therefore, while our hedge is not perfect,

73
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,280
it is close to being perfect.
