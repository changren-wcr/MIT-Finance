1
00:00:00,475 --> 00:00:01,850
PROFESSOR: In this video, I would

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,100
like to talk more specifically about the structure

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,050
of this course.

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,785
Similar to Part 1, this course is 12 weeks long.

5
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:13,250
It starts with this week, Week 0.

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,180
Then 10 weeks of the course content, and one week

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,090
dedicated to the final exam.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,860
It is an instructor-paced course,

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,770
and we will be releasing content each Wednesday

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:31,310
at 15:00 hours Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC.

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,980
Similar to part one, each week's content

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,210
will have three components: lectures, presentations,

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,340
and problem sets.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,290
Lecture videos deliver the main content

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,350
and introduce you to major concepts.

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,540
We encourage you to continue engaging

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,880
with the concept checks that accompany the lectures.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,210
We have received feedback from you

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,700
that these are a useful learning tool,

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,820
and we hope that they help you understand the material

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,880
of each learning module.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,180
Recitations are designed to bridge the gap between lectures

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,100
and problem sets.

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,340
The recitation content will help you understand and apply

25
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,920
the relevant lecture concepts, and will

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,110
help you solidify your understanding of the material.

27
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,710
As in part one, the problem sets of this course

28
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,750
are due each Wednesday at 15:00 hours UTC.

29
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,430
You have exactly one week to finish each problem set.

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,500
As a matter of policy, homework deadlines will not be extended.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,900
We do recognize, however, that circumstances

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,050
can arise that prevent you from meeting every single deadline,

33
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,960
and want to offer some flexibility.

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,830
Therefore, we have decided to drop your two lowest homework

35
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,810
scores at the end of the course.

36
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,920
In other words, of the 10 homeworks,

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,370
only the eight that you score highest on

38
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,480
will be counted towards your cumulative score.

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,520
We would like to re-emphasize the importance

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,890
of working diligently and consistently

41
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,150
throughout the course.

42
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,210
Do not fall behind.

43
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,630
Content is cumulative, and if you do not work consistently,

44
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,630
it will be difficult to catch up.

45
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,200
Data shows positive correlation between consistent work

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,670
and final exam scores.

47
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,900
In other words, if you would like to get a higher grade,

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,990
you need to work consistently.

49
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,170
My advice to you is to start each week's work early

50
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,230
and to put effort into learning the material.

51
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,750
You should plan to spend at least 10 hours a week

52
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,950
to succeed in this course.

53
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,670
You will not pass this course if you spend two hours a week

54
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,080
on it.

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
Because of this at time commitment,

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,060
we advise you to first realistically determine

57
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,780
if you can afford to spend this much time each week.

58
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,010
If you decide to take this course,

59
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,420
we strongly advise you to plan ahead, to schedule time

60
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,620
each week to study, and to work consistently.

61
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,010
Similar to Part 1, there will be a two-hour final exam

62
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,620
at the end of the course.

63
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,070
We're excited to have you back.

64
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,120
We will release week 11 of the course content next week.

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,670
Until then, we recommend that you

66
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,640
review your notes from Part 1 and get

67
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,010
ready to continue your journey of mastering finance.

68
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,000
