1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,280
PROFESSOR: In this video, I'm going

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,850
to review how to interact with the teaching team

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,670
and with your peers during this course.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,530
The answer is very simple--

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,740
the discussion forum.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,103
If you want to interact with your peers

7
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:17,520
or if you have a question that you

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,420
would like to ask the teaching team, go to the forum.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,580
The forum has two types of posts, a question

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,490
or a discussion.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,040
The difference between the two is as follows.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,500
If you want to share some insights or to make a comment,

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,990
post your comment as a discussion.

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,410
However, if you'll like to receive an answer,

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,650
then post it as a question.

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,570
Let me give you some specific tips.

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,800
First, before asking a question, take time

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,070
to think about the material.

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,670
To gain deep understanding of finance concepts,

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,080
you need patience.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,330
So take time.

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,790
Re-watch the lecture video or a recitation video.

23
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,040
We have invested considerable resources

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,090
in making the content very clear.

25
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,790
So chances are, if you have a question,

26
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,610
the answer is already there.

27
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:28,100
Second, when asking a question on the forum, be specific.

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,030
Provide a descriptive title so that it's easy for your peers

29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,930
to find your question and it is also easy for us

30
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,880
to understand what is your question about.

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,010
Third, always be polite and respectful.

32
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,670
We have learners from all over the world,

33
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,820
from different cultures and from different backgrounds.

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,120
Please be polite, and respect each other.

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,190
We take ethics in finance very seriously.

36
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,500
During the final exam period, we will

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,720
close the discussion forum.

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,910
Final exam is an individual work.

39
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,449
And we do not allow learners to share information

40
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,220
or to collaborate.

41
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,720
We expect you to follow the honor code of MIT.

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,650
My final tip for you is to study consistently

43
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,830
throughout the course.

44
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,620
It is a bad idea to cram for the exam.

45
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,530
If you do, you likely won't pass.

46
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,570
So get ready to work and explore the exciting world of finance.

47
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,000
