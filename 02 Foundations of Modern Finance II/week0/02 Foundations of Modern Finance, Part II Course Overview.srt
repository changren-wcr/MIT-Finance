JIANG WANG: I'm Jiang Wang.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,270
Welcome to Foundations of Modern Finance.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,820
We are the instructors for this course.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,610
Here, we would like to give a brief description

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,340
about the structure and content of the course.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,830
This course consists of two parts.

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,360
Part 1 develops the basics of modern finance,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,530
and Part 2 covers the more advanced topics.

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,200
LEONID KOGAN: Part two of the course has three sections.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,070
Sections A and B valuation of derivative securities,

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,940
portfolio theory, and the capital asset pricing model.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,390
Section C covers a range of topics in corporate finance,

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,050
including capital budgeting and real options, capital structure

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,650
choice, and interactions between firm investment and financing

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,330
decisions.

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,360
In Section A, we explore valuation and applications

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,640
of derivative securities.

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,920
In Lecture 1, we introduce forward

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,470
contracts, futures, and swaps.

21
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,800
We discuss the economic properties, valuation methods,

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,430
and how they can be used for risk management.

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,200
In Lecture 2 we introduce options.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,900
We cover the basic properties of options,

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,970
their valuation models, including

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,850
the risk neutral valuation and the Black-Scholes model,

27
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,010
and dynamic hedging.

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,560
In Lecture 3, we cover the portfolio theory,

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,910
and the mean-variance preferences.

30
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,890
In Lecture 4, we use the results on optimal portfolio choice

31
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,790
to derive the capital asset pricing model, or CAPM.

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,570
This is a central pricing theory,

33
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,350
which relates expected returns on financial assets

34
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,880
to their risk.

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,010
We discuss applications of the CAPM

36
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,740
and its empirical performance.

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,660
JIANG WANG: In Section 3 of Part 2 of the course,

38
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,080
we will return to corporate finance,

39
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,240
and complete our analysis of firms' financial decisions.

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,660
In Lecture 6, we will utilize the risk and valuation

41
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,240
tools we have developed in the course

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,060
to determine the appropriate discount rates,

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,500
and to value real options in capital budgeting decisions.

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,220
We turn to firms' financing decisions in Lecture 7.

45
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,270
In particular, we examine a firm's optimal choices

46
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,620
in capital structure, payout policy, and risk management

47
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,920
in the benchmark case where market frictions are

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,660
negligible.

49
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,390
Lecture 8 examines the credit risk

50
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,830
of a firm when it uses debt to finance its business.

51
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,290
In particular, how it's assessed and priced in the market.

52
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,260
In Lecture 9, we consider how different forms

53
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,340
of market frictions such as taxes, information and agency

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,820
costs, and imperfections in the financial market

55
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,870
will influence the firm's financing decisions.

56
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,070
Lecture 10 considers how a firm's investment and financing

57
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,920
decisions interact with each other.

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,240
In particular, we will consider the investment and financing

59
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,310
decisions in the holistic manner,

60
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,780
in how to achieve maximum value creation for the firm's

61
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,010
stakeholders.

62
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,450
We will be working together with you throughout this course,

63
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,380
and hope you will enjoy it.
