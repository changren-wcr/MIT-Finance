1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,920
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone, and welcome to the Foundations

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,800
of Modern Finance, Part II.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,010
This course is a continuation of part I.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,870
We hope that you had a good learning

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,330
experience in the first part of the course,

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,059
and are excited to welcome you back.

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,790
We were impressed by your engagement and hard work

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,470
in Part I, and encourage you to keep it up in Part II.

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,930
Our courses at a MIT Sloan are challenging.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,970
We believe that it is important to have

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,670
deep understanding of the foundational principles

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,910
of finance, and we hope that you will continue working

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,760
towards achieving this goal.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,330
The content covered in the second part of the course

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,920
is exciting.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,680
We begin this course by learning about financial derivatives,

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,110
such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options.

18
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,120
These are important financial instruments

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,670
and are used widely by a variety of market participants.

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,480
For example, asset owners and asset managers

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,760
use derivatives to protect the value of their holdings.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,910
Corporations use derivatives, such as swaps and currency

23
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:10,100
forwards to smooth fluctuations in the cost of doing business.

24
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,660
For example, airlines use crude oil and heating oil swaps

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,360
to hedge their exposure to oil prices, which

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,713
affect their cost of fuel.

27
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,130
We will spend the first three weeks of our course learning

28
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,380
about these topics.

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,260
We will then move on to portfolio theory

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,110
and the Capital Asset Pricing Model, commonly known

31
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,120
as the CAPM.

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,670
Recall that we have already learned a very important asset

33
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,380
pricing model in Part I--

34
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,110
the Arbitrage Pricing Theory.

35
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,970
In Part II, we will learn how CAPM differs from APT.

36
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,020
Importantly, CAPM is one of the most widely used asset pricing

37
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,680
models in practice, particularly in corporate finance

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,900
to estimate the cost of capital.

39
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,520
We will spend two weeks on these topics.

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,540
In the second half of this course,

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,400
we will learn about corporate finance.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,895
We will cover topics such as Modigliani-Miller Theorem,

43
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:08,270
weighted average cost of capital,

44
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,080
or WACC, and the adjusted present value.

45
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,320
We will then discuss interplays between investment decisions

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,810
and financing decisions.

47
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,180
We will conclude this module with a discussion

48
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,660
of how firms should return the capital back to shareholders,

49
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,200
which we refer to as a payout policy, and corporate risk

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,560
management.

51
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,890
Throughout this course, we will be heavily relying on tools

52
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,420
that we learned in Part I. For example, state-space model will

53
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,510
become very handy when we will be pricing

54
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,660
options and corporate debt.

55
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,050
Because this course builds on Part I, learners

56
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,720
who have completed Part I are best positioned

57
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,360
to understand the content covered in this course

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,960
and succeed in it.

59
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,670
To emphasize that this course--

60
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,790
Part II-- is a continuation of Part I,

61
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,610
we have numbered content weeks in this course,

62
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,510
starting from 11.

63
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,060
We strongly recommend that you take Part I

64
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,020
before attempting this course, or Part II.

65
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,570
If you're interested in finance and in our MicroMasters

66
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,660
program, but have not yet had a chance to take Part I,

67
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,090
we suggest that you instead start

68
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,850
by taking either our accounting course

69
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,600
or our mathematical methods course, both of which

70
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,020
serve as entry points into our program.

71
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,330
You can then take Foundations of Modern Finance,

72
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,390
Part I when it is next offered.

73
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,790
You can find the complete schedule of our courses

74
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,030
on our MIT MicroMasters website, as well as

75
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,500
in our edX MicroMasters program page.

76
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,000
