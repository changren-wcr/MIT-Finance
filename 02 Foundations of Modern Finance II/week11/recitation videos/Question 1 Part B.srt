00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,340
PROFESSOR: In this video, let's use the same approach,

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,450
but instead of constructing an arbitrage strategy that

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,440
generates $100 right now, we will construct an arbitrage

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,520
strategy that generates $100 in year 1 and 0 in years 0 and 2.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,310
In our system of equations, the only thing that changes

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,850
is the desired payoff.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,170
Right now, instead of $100 in the first equation in year 0,

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,070
we have $100 in the second equation, or in year 1.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,500
Now let's go back to Excel and solve this system.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,920
Let's change our desired outcome vector

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,730
by putting 0 dollars in the first cell in year 0

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,480
and $100 in the second cell, or in year 1.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,115
And since everything is soft-coded in my spreadsheet,

14
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,490
everything automatically changes.

15
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,390
So you could see that our positions are recalculated,

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,710
and you could see that the net payoff--

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:00,320
now I have 0 in year 0 and 100 in year 1, exactly what I want.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,020
Let's look at the positions.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:09,340
We are going short r1, short f1, and we're going long r2.

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,840
And although the numbers change, the logic does not change.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,310
We're still going long r2, just because r2 is a higher

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,440
rate relative to r1 and f1.
