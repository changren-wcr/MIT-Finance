00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,009
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,980
use an example to demonstrate valuation of interest rate

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,750
swaps.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,730
ABC Corporation has borrowed $3 million

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,420
for the next three years at a variable interest rate.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,750
Under the terms of the loan, ABC will pay interest

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,770
at the end of years one, two, and three.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,630
The interest rate that ABC will need

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,350
to pay at the end of year one is based on the one-year spot

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,290
interest rate in year zero.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,780
The interest rate to be paid at the end of year two

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,220
will be based on the one-year spot rate in year one.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,800
And the interest rate to be paid at the end of year three

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,700
will be based on the one-year spot rate in year two.

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,450
Typically, corporate bank loans are tied to benchmark interest

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,610
rates such as LIBOR.

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,250
These benchmark rates vary over time.

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,370
And therefore, interest rate and interest expense

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,930
that corporations pay on their bank loans vary over time.

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,560
Suppose that the current one year, two year,

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,150
and three-year spot rates are 3.5%, 4%, and 4.2%

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,720
respectively.

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,900
These spot rates will be used to calculate present values.

24
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,810
Now, given this term structure of interest rates,

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,080
we know that the interest rate for the first year of the loan

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,840
is 3.5%.

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,660
However, we do not know what the interest rate will

28
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,030
be during the second year of the loan

29
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,240
because it will be whatever the one-year spot interest

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,120
rate is at the beginning of the second year.

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,610
Based on spot interest rates today, we

32
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,310
can calculate the implied one-year spot

33
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,610
rate that will be in effect during the second year.

34
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,850
In other words, we can compute the one-year forward rate

35
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,650
in year one.

36
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,302
Please check that this rate is 4.502%.

37
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:53,160
However, under this loan, the interest rate

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,350
for the second year could be higher or lower than 4.502%

39
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,440
depending on the interest rates in year one.

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,620
Same logic applies to year three.

41
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,360
ABC Corporation is not comfortable

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,389
with the uncertainty of year two and year three interest rates.

43
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,070
So it wants to enter into an interest rate swap that

44
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,030
will fix the interest rates for the three

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,490
years of the term of this loan.

46
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,910
Let's characterize this interest rate swap.

47
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,400
It has a three-year term.

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,370
It has annual settlements with settlement dates

49
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,150
at the end of years one, two, and three.

50
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,480
And ABC Corporation will pay fixed rate

51
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,920
which I'll denote as rs during the three years of the loan.

52
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,530
The counterparty on the swap will pay the floating rate.

53
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,390
To price this swap, we need to find the fixed rate rs.

54
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,210
This interest rate should be fair to both parties

55
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,600
in the sense that the present value of interest expense

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,330
at variable rate should equal to the present value of interest

57
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,880
expense at the fixed rate.

58
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,840
We will use this equation to find rate rs.

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,120
To use this pricing equation, let's first

60
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,710
find our interest expense at the variable rates.

61
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,240
In year one, our interest expense

62
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,000
will be the principal amount, the $3 million,

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,210
multiplied by spot rate r1, which is

64
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,160
3.5% which gives us $105,000.

65
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,100
In year two, our interest expense

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,800
will be the face value of the loan, which is again $3 million

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,560
multiplied by one-year forward rate

68
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,350
in year one, which is 4.502%.

69
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:46,300
This gives us the interest expense of $135,072.46.

70
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,760
Finally, in year three, the interest expense

71
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,620
will be face value, $3 million, multiplied

72
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,340
by one-year forward rate in year two.

73
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,010
You can verify that this rate is 4.601%.

74
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,570
And therefore, the total interest expense in year three

75
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,370
is $138,034.64.

76
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,360
At the fixed interest rate rs, our annual interest expense

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,360
will be $3 million face value multiplied by the rate rs.

78
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,740
Putting this all together, this is our swap pricing equation.

79
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,400
The only unknown in this equation is the fixed rate rs.

80
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,470
Solving this equation for this rate

81
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,500
gives us the fixed rate of 4.185%.

82
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,000
