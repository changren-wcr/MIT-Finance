PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,310
show how to construct arbitrage trading strategies using

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,110
forward contracts.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,277
Consider the following example.

4
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:11,610
Suppose of the current price of a dividend paying stocks

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,130
equals $1,000.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,200
Suppose the risk free rate equals 3%

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,350
and the dividend yield is 2%, both

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,020
are continuously compounded.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,880
You notice that a forward price for delivery

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,770
of this stock in two years is $1,025.

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,600
Is there an arbitrage opportunity here?

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,620
Let's use the model of payout to compute the forward price

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,560
given the current stock price, which is given

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,320
by the following expression.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,390
Applied to our case, the forward price for delivery of stock

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,960
two years from now should equal $1,020.20.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:59,600
Given that the forward price that is quoted to us is $1,025,

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,630
this forward is overpriced.

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,060
How should we exploit this overpricing?

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,640
Consider the following trading strategy.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,880
First, we engage in one short forward contract.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,766
Second, we borrow the following amount of dollars,

23
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:20,190
e to the power negative y times cap T, times S0 which

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,600
is the current share price.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,320
And we borrow this amount at the risk-free rate.

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,680
Third, we buy e to the power of negative y times

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
T shares of stock.

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,230
And fourth, during the next two years

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,120
that we are holding this stock, we

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,550
will reinvest continuous stream of dividends

31
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,880
by buying additional units of the stock.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,520
Notice that the initial cost of setting up this portfolio

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,520
is zero.

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,640
Now let's see what happens two years from now.

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,400
First, let's figure out how many shares of stock

36
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,580
we will have at the end of year 2.

37
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,120
Well, because we're continuously reinvesting dividends,

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,190
our future value of the number of shares that we have,

39
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,300
which I denote here as the number of shares at cap T,

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,350
would equal to the exponent raised to the power yT, which

41
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,350
gives us the future value of the initial amount of the number

42
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,230
of shares that we purchased from the very beginning, which

43
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,490
is e raised to the power negative y cap T.

44
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,620
This gives us 1.

45
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,850
So therefore, at the end of year 2,

46
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,370
we will have 1 share of stock.

47
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,110
Second, what we will do is that we

48
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,490
will deliver this one share to the counterparty to whom we

49
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,950
sold our forward contract, and collect $1,025.

50
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,010
Third, we will need to repay the loan.

51
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,980
The future value of this loan is given

52
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,600
by the following expression.

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,520
Because we borrowed at the risk-free rate,

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,230
and the initial borrowed amount was

55
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,370
e to the power negative yT times S0,

56
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,470
this value grew to e to the power r times T times

57
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,410
the initial amount, which altogether gives us

58
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,960
S0 times e raised to the power r minus y multiplied by cap T.

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,230
And this gives us $1,020.20.

60
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,370
Altogether, this trading strategy generates a profit

61
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,220
of $4.80 per one forward contract that we short.

62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,330
These arbitrage profits are possible because this forward

63
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,930
was overpriced relative to the model of payout

64
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,990
that we covered in class.
