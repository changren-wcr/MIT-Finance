1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,610
PROFESSOR: Now, there is an alternative way

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,570
of thinking about this problem.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,560
And it may be easier for you to think in these other terms

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,760
because our liabilities are in the United States dollars.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,860
So in this case, what we would do

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,800
is that, to satisfy these liabilities,

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,020
that, again, we have one year from now,

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,770
we notice that this is how much we will get in Japanese yen

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,300
in one year.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,690
What we can do is that we can convert this amount

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,930
that we'll get in one year in Japanese yen

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,180
to United States dollars.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,550
And we can do that by locking ourselves

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,460
into the one-year forward exchange rate that,

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,980
again, currently trades at 106.

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,100
Now in this case, then, our income, one year right

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,620
now can be expressed in the United States dollars

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,920
by doing the following.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,170
So taking this Japanese yen amount and dividing it by 106.

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,690
Now let me also show you that if we

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,380
were to express our future income in United States

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,410
dollars, we'd have gotten, of course, the same answer

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,800
at the very end.

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,720
So if our liabilities are x times 1 plus 1% USD,

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,280
then our income expressed in United States dollars

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,060
would be the original amount divided by 106 because this

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,020
is us locking in the forward exchange rate when we take

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,350
this Japanese yen and converted it into the United States

29
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,943
dollars using this 106 forward exchange rate.

30
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:30,360
So, and then, in this case, again,

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,457
equating our income with our liabilities

32
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:35,040
would give us this equation right now.

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,040
So this is the original divided by 106,

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,242
and this would equal to x times 1 plus 1%.

35
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:42,700
And now you could see that this is,

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,945
of course, the same equation as we had before.

37
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:46,320
And so if we were to solve it, we

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,720
would have gotten exactly the same result at the very end.

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,300
So therefore, of course it doesn't

40
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,670
matter whether we express our income and our liabilities

41
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,790
in either Japanese yen at the end of the year

42
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,410
or in the United States dollars.

43
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,400
The end result is the same.
