INSTRUCTOR: Let's use an alternative way

2
00:00:01,817 --> 00:00:03,450
to solve this question.

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,220
Recall that for a swap that has a term of capital T years,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,100
the fixed rate on the swap rs is given

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,190
by the following expression where these are

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,800
prices of zero-discount bonds.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,180
In our case, given that our swap has three-year term,

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,360
the fixed rate on the swap should equal to the following

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,320
expression--

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,070
1 minus the price of a three-year, zero-coupon bond

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,729
divided by the sum of the prices of one-year, two-year, and

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,490
three-year zero-coupon bonds.

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,000
Given spot rates r1, r2, and r3, we

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,070
can rewrite the previous equation

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,350
in the following terms.

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,720
Plugging in the numbers, we will get rs equal to 4.185%.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,810
This is exactly the same result as we

18
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,560
obtained in the previous video.
