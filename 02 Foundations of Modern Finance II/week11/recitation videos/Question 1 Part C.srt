00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,990
INSTRUCTOR: Finally, let us construct an arbitrage trading

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,440
strategy that generates $100 in year 2 and nothing

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,840
in years 0 and 1.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,300
Again, the only thing that changes

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,430
is the right-hand side of the equation 3

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,550
where instead of 0, we have $100 right now.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,820
So we're getting $0 in years 0 and 1 and $100 in year 2.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's go back to Excel and solve the system.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Recall that in my spreadsheet, everything is soft coded.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,980
So all I have to do right now is I have to put 0 in year 1

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,880
and I have to put 100, my desired outcome, in year 2.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,160
And therefore, this Excel spreadsheet

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,770
will recompute the positions that I have to take in order

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,850
to achieve this outcome.

15
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,680
So I have to go short R1 in this exact amount,

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,340
short F1 in this amount, and go long in this amount in R2.
