00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,230
PROFESSOR: In the previous video,

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,040
we built an arbitrage trading strategy

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,840
to exploit a situation when the forward was overpriced.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,060
Now, consider the converse situation, when

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,950
the forward is underpriced.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,560
Let's assume that the price of this two-year

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,210
forward is $1,015.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,450
How do we exploit this?

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,540
Consider the following trading strategy.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,060
Since the forward is underpriced,

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,870
we will engage in one long forward contract.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,070
Next, we will short-sell the following number of shares,

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,850
e to the power of negative yT.

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,580
We will invest the proceeds from the short sale

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,150
of the stock, which will be e to the power

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,780
of negative yT times S-naught dollars at the risk-free rate.

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,250
Notice that the initial cost of setting up this portfolio

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,440
is zero.

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,990
Let's see what happens two years from now.

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,600
First, let's figure out how many shares of stock

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,550
we need to return.

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,610
The answer is one share.

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,660
Recall that we borrowed e to the power of negative yT shares,

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,450
but the share pays continuous dividend y,

25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,760
and therefore we need to return both dividends

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,270
and the original amount of shares to the owner.

27
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,640
If the dividends are continuously reinvested,

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,160
the original borrowed amount would grow to one share.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,970
Second, our initial investment at the risk-free rate

30
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,850
is now worth $1,020.20.

31
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,500
Next, you take $1,015 out of this

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,920
$1,020.20 that you have in your bank account,

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,650
and you pay the seller of the forward contract, who

34
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,020
in turn delivers one share of stock to you.

35
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,180
You use this share of stock to cover your short position.

36
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,270
As a result, this trading strategy generates $5.20

37
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,290
in profits per one forward contract bought.

38
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,240
The reason for this arbitrage profits

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,870
is, again, the fact that the forward contract

40
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,950
was initially underpriced.
