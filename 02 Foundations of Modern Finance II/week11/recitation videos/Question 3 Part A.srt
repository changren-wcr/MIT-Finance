00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,875
PROFESSOR: In this question, I will teach you

1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:05,190
how to construct arbitrage trading strategies

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,290
in foreign exchange markets.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,070
Suppose that, currently, the currency pay rate United States

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,210
dollar to Japanese yen--

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,890
USD, JPY-- trades at 105.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,920
This means that for one United States dollar,

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,290
you get 105 Japanese yen.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:28,230
Now also, suppose that USD-JPY currency pair,

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,660
one-year forward on that currency pair

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,300
currently trades at 106.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,390
Now we will also assume that the current US one-year risk-free

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,440
interest rate is 1%, and the current Japanese one-year

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,770
risk-free interest rate is 3%.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,310
So the goal is to construct an arbitrage trading

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:53,410
strategy that pays $100 right now and nothing in the future.

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,220
Let me mention that all of these interest rates

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,070
and the current pricing of this currency pair's exchange rates

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,240
are hypothetical and may not reflect the current reality.

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,980
Let's start solving this question

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,960
by assuming that we borrow x United States dollars today.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,990
We will keep $100 to ourselves and consume it

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,860
because this is what we want.

23
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,270
We want to construct a strategy that gives us $100 right now.

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,850
So out of this x borrowed amount,

25
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,800
we keep $100 to ourselves.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,550
And then the rest, x minus 100, what

27
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,800
we will do with this is we will exchange it

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,110
right now to Japanese yen at the current spot exchange rate,

29
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,490
and then we will invest this amount of Japanese yen

30
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,570
into the one-year risk-free Japanese bond that pays us

31
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,670
3% interest rate.

32
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,380
Now the question is, how much will we get in one year?

33
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,050
Well, let's see.

34
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,220
This is how much USD we have today, x minus 100.

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,740
We're exchanging this into Japanese yen,

36
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,500
and the current exchange rate is 105,

37
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,509
so this is how much Japanese yen we have after we exchanged

38
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,250
this USD amount.

39
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,610
And then we're earning 3% interest rate on this amount

40
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,910
in Japanese yen, and the interest rate is 3%,

41
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,130
so this is multiplied by 1 plus 3%.

42
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,320
So this is how much in Japanese yen

43
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,090
we will get in one year from this investment strategy.

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,370
Now, what are our liabilities?

45
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,740
Well, we borrowed x United States dollars,

46
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,590
and we borrowed it at the risk-free rate of 1%.

47
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,410
So therefore, in year one, we owe

48
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,280
the bank or whoever we borrowed this from x times 1 plus 1%.

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,250
And so our liabilities are in the United States dollars.

50
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,680
Now, because our income is in Japanese yen,

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,250
we can convert these liabilities in the Japanese yen

52
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,220
as well so that that way we can match our income

53
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,200
and our liabilities in the same currency.

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,740
So now if this is our liabilities in the United

55
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,040
States in year one, what would be

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,160
these liabilities in Japanese yen one year from now?

57
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,880
Well, we can know this for sure if we

58
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,110
lock into the current one-year forward exchange rate that

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,850
currently trades at 106.

60
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,360
So if we do that, then our liabilities one year

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,920
from now in Japanese yen would be x times 1 plus 1% times 106.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,610
Now since we expressed both our income and our liabilities

63
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,860
in Japanese yen, all we have to do

64
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,230
is to make sure that our liabilities-- or we have

65
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,190
enough income to satisfy our liabilities in one year.

66
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,330
So all we have to do is we have to equate

67
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,270
our income to our liabilities, and this is the equation

68
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,410
that we have.

69
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,020
This is a very simple equation with just one unknown.

70
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,520
We're solving it for x.

71
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,190
And x here would equal to $9,922 United States dollars.

72
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,770
So therefore, to construct, given this information,

73
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,410
to construct an arbitrage trading strategy that

74
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:18,040
pays $100 today, we need to borrow $9,922 United States

75
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,050
dollars and do the following steps.

76
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:26,950
So we can keep $100 to ourselves if we convert the remaining

77
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,030
amount, which is $9,922, into Japanese yen,

78
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,290
invest our income--

79
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,540
and if we lock into this forward rate as well--

80
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,620
our income in one year is exactly

81
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,590
enough to pay our liabilities that we

82
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,710
owe our bank from whom we borrowed this x dollar amount.

83
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,860
Now, what makes this arbitrage possible

84
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,970
in this particular example is the fact that this forward

85
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,680
is mispriced.

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,840
In other words, you get too high of an income in Japanese yen

87
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,940
relative to the United States dollars

88
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,610
so that at the current forward exchange rate,

89
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,320
you're getting a good deal, and you're

90
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,690
able to do this so-called carry trade,

91
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,780
borrow in the low yielding currency,

92
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,640
convert this amount of low yielding currency

93
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,730
into high yielding currency, invest there, and earn profit

94
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,400
by doing that.

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,180
Now, in fact, this is how we price forwards,

96
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,960
by assuming that such profitable trading strategy is not

97
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,810
possible.

98
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,050
So therefore, the foreign exchange rate

99
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,380
here has to be such that when you're

100
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,290
trying to construct this particular trading strategy,

101
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,430
you get exactly 0 at the end.

102
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,820
So the fact that this is possible here

103
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,220
is just indicative of the fact that this forward

104
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,230
is currently mispriced.

105
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,200
Now, let me make one remark.

106
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,100
Recall that when we started this construction of this arbitrage

107
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,960
trading strategy, we started by assuming

108
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,170
that we borrow x in USD.

109
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,810
What if, by solving this, we would

110
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,840
have gotten a negative number at the very end?

111
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,030
In this case, what it would have implied

112
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,060
is that we borrowed in the wrong currency, in other words,

113
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,220
in more expensive currency.

114
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,350
In that case, if we get the negative number here

115
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,725
at the end, what we need to do is

116
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,040
that we need just to reverse the chain of arguments

117
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,640
and actually borrow a certain amount in Japanese yen

118
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,400
and repeat the process by converting it into USD

119
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,790
and investing in the United States risk-free securities.
