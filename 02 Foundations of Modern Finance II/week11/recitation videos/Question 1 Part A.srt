00:00:00,595 --> 00:00:02,720
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will review forward

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,940
interest rates, and we will consider

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,620
an example of arbitrage in the interest rate market.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,380
The following table shows current interest rates.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,090
The one-year spot rate is 1%, the two-year spot rate is 3%,

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,470
and the one-year forward rate in year 1 is 4%.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,550
Construct the following three arbitrage strategies.

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,810
Strategy 1 pays $100 today and nothing in the future.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,580
Strategy 2 pays $100 in year 1 and nothing otherwise.

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:41,000
And strategy 3 pays $100 in year 2 and nothing otherwise.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,920
We will show you a generic approach

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,970
on how to tackle this type of questions, similar to the bond

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,500
arbitrage that we taught you in the first part of this course.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,650
Suppose that you invest x dollars at one-year spot

15
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,830
rate, which we'll denote as r1.

16
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,830
Suppose that you invest y dollars at a two-year spot

17
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,830
rate, which we'll denote by r2.

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,200
And suppose that you will invest z dollars

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,270
at the one-year forward rate in year 1, which

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,450
we'll denote as f1.

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,120
Let's start by constructing the first arbitrage

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,750
strategy that generates $100 in year 0

23
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,290
and nothing in years 1 and 2.

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,920
We have the following system of three equations, each of which

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,190
shows our cash flows in years 0, 1, and 2.

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,020
Recall that we're investing x dollars at one-year spot rate

27
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,610
and y dollars at two-year spot rate.

28
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,120
So therefore, in year 0, our cash flows

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,190
are negative x and negative y, and that should equal to $100

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,090
that we would like to generate as part of our arbitrage

31
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,120
trading strategy.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,370
The second equation shows our cash flows in year 1.

33
00:01:53,370 --> 00:02:00,030
We get 1 plus r1 times x from our investment in year 0 at r1,

34
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,610
and at the same time we're spending z dollars

35
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,740
by investing at a one-year forward rate f1.

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,810
And that equals to 0 dollars because this is, again,

37
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,320
what we're trying to construct.

38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,040
The third equation shows our cash flows in year 2.

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,730
We're getting 1 plus r2 squared times y.

40
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,600
This is the payoff from our initial investment of y dollars

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,670
at r2 for two years.

42
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,830
And we're getting 1 plus f1 times z.

43
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,100
This is the cash inflow from our investment of z

44
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,200
at f1 in year 1.

45
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,480
The total cash flow in year 2 equals

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,210
to 0 dollars as well, because this is

47
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,650
what we're trying to achieve.

48
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,540
Now let's solve this system of equations using Excel.

49
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,850
In this spreadsheet, we have coefficients

50
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,980
on x, y, and z in our system here in the matrix.

51
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,810
This coefficient is 1 times 1 plus r1.

52
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,060
This coefficient is 1 plus r2 raised to the power of 2.

53
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,000
And this is 1 plus f1.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,530
So what we have to do right now is

55
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,988
that we have to invert this matrix,

56
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,665
and then we have to multiply it by this.

57
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:13,290
So what I will do here is that again, I

58
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,210
will highlight the cells.

59
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,290
I will say m inverse.

60
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,960
I will take this array, and I will hit Shift-Control-Enter,

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,240
because I'm on the Windows system,

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,610
to get the inverted matrix right here.

63
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,070
And then all I have to do is that I

64
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:38,400
will have to multiply this inverted matrix right here

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,530
by this desired outcome vector of the cash flows

66
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,020
that we were trying to achieve.

67
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,940
And this gives me positions on our bonds that we have to take.

68
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,190
In this vector that we just computed,

69
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,170
negative numbers imply short positions and positive numbers

70
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,570
imply long positions.

71
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,400
So that effectively means is that we are investing at r2

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,520
and we're borrowing at r1, and we're borrowing in the year 1

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,990
at f1 as well.

74
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,620
So you could see that in year 0, this strategy indeed produces

75
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:22,130
$100, because we're borrowing $10,103.81 at r1

76
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,840
and we're investing only $10,003.81 at r2,

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,400
therefore leaving ourselves $100.

78
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,250
Now let's see what our cash inflows and cash outflows

79
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,410
in years 1 and 2.

80
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,910
In year 1, our cash inflow would come from the fact

81
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:47,420
that we are borrowing this amount at f1 forward rate.

82
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,310
What would be our cash outflow?

83
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,300
Recall that we borrowed this amount in year 0 at r1,

84
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,320
and so therefore we have to repay this amount multiplied

85
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,850
by 1 plus interest rate r1.

86
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,040
And you could see that this is exactly

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,230
the same amount as our cash inflow,

88
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,920
and so therefore net, which is the sum of inflow and outflow

89
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,600
in this table that I constructed,

90
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,390
would equal to exactly 0.

91
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,830
In year 2, our cash flows would come from our investment at r2

92
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,230
in year 0, the amount of which would

93
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:32,420
be this multiplied by 1 plus r2 raised to the power of 2.

94
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,180
And our outflow will come from the fact

95
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,120
that we borrowed this amount at f1,

96
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,580
so therefore our cash outflow would

97
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,310
be this position multiplied by 1 plus the forward rate.

98
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,400
And again, you could see that the two

99
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,610
amounts are exactly the same.

100
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,190
So therefore, on net, we're getting 0 dollars in year 2.

101
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,410
So therefore, we achieved exactly the outcome

102
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,040
that we wanted.

103
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:04,800
We get $100 in year 0 and we get nothing in years 1 and 2.

104
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,740
Let me conclude by explaining economic intuition-- why,

105
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,260
in this arbitrage trading strategy,

106
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,450
we are going long the r2 rate and short r1 and f1.

107
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,340
Let's consider two scenarios.

108
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,520
In scenario 1, we're investing $100 for three years

109
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,900
at r2, and in scenario 2, investing $100

110
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:31,680
first for one year at r1, and then for another year at f1.

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,200
So let's see what would be the payoff of scenario 1

112
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,470
and scenario 2 at the end of year 2.

113
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,870
So scenario 1 gives us $100 times

114
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,180
1 plus r2, raised to the power of 2.

115
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:55,350
And scenario 2 gives us $100 multiplied by 1 plus r1

116
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,070
multiplied by 1 plus f1.

117
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,280
And that gives us $105.04.

118
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,790
So clearly, we can see that scenario 1 gives us

119
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,180
a higher payoff at the end of year 2 than scenario 2,

120
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,330
so therefore, relative to r1 and f1,

121
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,050
r2 is a good interest rate to invest at.

122
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,630
And therefore, our arbitrage trading strategy

123
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,800
that yields $100 today and nothing in years 1 and 2

124
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,860
goes long r2 and short r1 and f1.

125
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,000
