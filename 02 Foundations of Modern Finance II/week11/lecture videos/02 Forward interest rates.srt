00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,530
PROFESSOR: The risk-free rate of return between now

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,130
and the future date, t, is given by the corresponding spot

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,560
interest rate, r sub t.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,070
In addition to the spot rates, we now introduce forward

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,090
interest rates.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,670
Forward interest rates apply to transactions

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,650
between two future dates.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,880
For instance, t equal to one, and t equal to two.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,370
The forward trade between these two dates

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,160
is specified by a forward transaction

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,790
to borrow money for one period at a future date at t

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,700
equal to 1.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,500
The terms of the forward transaction

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,590
are fixed today at t equals 0.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,500
The loan is received at date one.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,980
The loan is repaid at date two.

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,190
It is important to distinguish forward interest rates

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,710
from the future spot rates.

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,260
Future spot rates are random and are

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,630
generally different from the current forward rates.

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,030
Consider the following example.

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,480
As the CFO of a US multinational company,

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,610
you expect to repatriate 10 million dollars

24
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,820
from a foreign subsidiary in one year.

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,200
These funds will be used to pay dividends a year later.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,510
You do not know what the spot interest rates

27
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,170
will be in one year from now.

28
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,180
To avoid randomness, you would like

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,320
to fix your lending rate for a period of one year starting

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,600
one year from now.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,880
The current interest rates are as follows--

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,510
The one-year spot rate is 5%.

33
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,840
And the two-year spot rate is 7%.

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,730
What should you do?

35
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,290
Consider the following strategy.

36
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,880
Let's borrow $9,524,000 today for a period of one year

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,330
at the spot rate of 5%.

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:00,150
At the same time, we invest the same amount 9.524 million

39
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,250
for two years, at the two-year spot rate of 7%.

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,570
The resulting cash flows are shown in the following table--

41
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,860
The net cash flow at time 0 is 0.

42
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,080
We borrow and lend the same amount.

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,660
At time 1, we repatriate $10 million

44
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:25,260
and use it to repay the one year loan we took out at time, 0.

45
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,710
At time 2, our two-year investment matures.

46
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,660
And we collect $10,904,000.

47
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,170
As you can see, we were able to transform the 10 million

48
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,420
cash flow at time 1, into a cash flow of 10.904 million

49
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,070
at time 2.

50
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,390
In other words, we managed to lock in a one year lending

51
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,990
rate of 9.04%, starting one year from now.

52
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,080
We conclude that to avoid arbitrage,

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,390
the one-year forward interest rates starting

54
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,440
one year from now, must be equal to 9.04%.

55
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,310
The previous example shows that forward rates

56
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,010
are related to the spot rates by an arbitrage argument.

57
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,840
Let's use this logic to establish

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,440
a general relation between the spot and forward interest

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,610
rates.

60
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,850
Specifically, consider two alternative investment

61
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,710
strategies between now and time t.

62
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,460
The first strategy is to invest at the current spot interest

63
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,000
rate between now and time t.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,680
In this case $1 invested today compounds for t periods

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,130
at the current spot rate, resulting in the time,

66
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,650
t value equal to the left hand side

67
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,470
of the highlighted formula.

68
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,280
Under the second strategy, we invest at the spot interest

69
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,580
rate for t minus 1 periods, and then

70
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,490
reinvest the proceeds at the one-period forward rate,

71
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,950
which is known today.

72
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,250
$1 invested today compounds for t

73
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,480
minus 1 period at the current spot rate for that tenor,

74
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,230
and then the growth for one more period at the forward rate,

75
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,829
resulting in the time, t value equal to the right-hand side

76
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,490
of the highlighted formula.

77
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,700
Because both strategies start with a dollar

78
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,330
and generate a risk-free cash flow at time t,

79
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,390
to avoid arbitrage, they must produce the same amount.

80
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,050
This argument allows us to relate

81
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,590
the one-period forward rate between time t minus 1

82
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,770
and t to the corresponding spot rates.

83
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,920
There is a one-to-one relation between the yield curve

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,040
or the term structure of the spot interest rates

85
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,260
and the term structure of the forward rates.

86
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,570
The following example illustrates

87
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,480
how we can apply the forward rate formula

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,230
and how to replicate forward contracts using transactions

89
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,110
in the spot market.

90
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,990
The current term structure of the spot rates

91
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,170
and the corresponding prices of discount bonds

92
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,530
are given in the table.

93
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,850
A customer of your bank wants to enter into a forward contract

94
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,700
to borrow $20 million for one year,

95
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,210
starting three years from now.

96
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,250
Can you quote a rate?

97
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,560
Using the formula for the forward rate,

98
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,170
with the spot rates for years three and four

99
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,090
equal to 6.5% and 7% respectively,

100
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,120
the one-year forward rate between year three and four

101
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,940
is 8.51%.

102
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,710
To lock in these cash flows today,

103
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,720
we execute the following transactions

104
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,430
in the spot market.

105
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,100
We buy three-year discount bonds,

106
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,990
with a face value of $20 million.

107
00:05:52,990 --> 00:06:01,080
This costs $16,556,000 today.

108
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,110
We finance this purchase by selling four-year discount

109
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,510
bonds.

110
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:12,080
These have the face value of $21,701,000.

111
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,180
This generates the same amount, $16,556,000.

112
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,290
The net cash flow at time, 0 is 0 dollars.

113
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,090
And we are left with the liability

114
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:31,970
in the amount of 21,701,000 due in four years.

115
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,900
Our strategy results in two non-zero cash flows.

116
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,800
At time 3, our three-year bond pays off 20 million.

117
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,640
At time 4, our position in four-year bonds

118
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,850
matures, and we must repay 21,701,000.

119
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,050
The above cash flows correspond to a forward transaction, where

120
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,380
one borrows for one year, starting in year three,

121
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,050
at the forward rate of 8.51%.

122
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,860
We now return to the expectations hypothesis

123
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,780
and restate it as a relation between spot and forward rates.

124
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,150
Under the expectations hypothesis,

125
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,300
expected returns on all bonds are the same.

126
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,510
Take the current day to be time 0.

127
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,420
Using the definition of the forward rate,

128
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,340
the expectations hypothesis states

129
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,560
that as of now, the expected value of the one year spot rate

130
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,780
between time t and t plus 1 is equal to the current value

131
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:43,280
of the one year forward rate between time t and t plus 1.

132
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,240
In other words, under the expectations hypothesis,

133
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,540
current forward rates are unbiased predictors

134
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,620
of the future spot rates.

135
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,190
Empirically forward rates are biased predictors

136
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,930
of the future support rates.

137
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,500
They over-predict future spot rates on average.

138
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,140
The reason is that the forward rate

139
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,720
reflects a risk premium in addition

140
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,250
to the expectations of the future spot rates.
