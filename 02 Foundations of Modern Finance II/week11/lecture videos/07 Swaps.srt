1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,970
PROFESSOR: Swaps are important and commonly-used

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,370
derivative contracts, closely related

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,840
to forwards and futures.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,220
A swap is a contract in which two counterparties agree

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,450
to exchange specified amounts of assets, such as cash,

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,510
financial assets, or commodities at a set of given future dates.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,390
The figure below offers a stylized representation

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,200
of a swap between two counterparties, A and B.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,750
The upward-pointing arrows represent

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,880
cash flows collected by investor A. The downward-pointing arrows

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,380
are the cash flows collected by investor B.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,230
Note that the times series profile of these cash flows

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,640
differs.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,940
In the case of investor A, fixed payments

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,840
are received each period, while payments of investor B

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,880
fluctuate randomly.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,930
Consider an interest rate swap.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,960
Under this contract, a fixed rate of interest

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,330
is exchanged for a reference floating rate.

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,670
A popular choice for the reference rate

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,690
for interest rate swaps is LIBOR, the London InterBank

22
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,870
Offered Rate.

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,150
Under the swap contract, payments

24
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,010
are made periodically, for instance,

25
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,820
at the end of each six-month sub-period.

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,990
Consider an example of a LIBOR swap.

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,120
Assume the current one-month LIBOR is 0.5%.

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,100
You enter into a five-year fixed for floating swap with a fixed

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,570
rate of 0.7%.

30
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,190
If LIBOR rises in the future, you

31
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,300
receive higher payments on the floating leg

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,640
and continue making fixed payments

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,320
on the fixed leg of the swap.

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,640
As a result, the swap represents a bet on higher future values

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,210
of LIBOR.

36
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,270
We now analyze the valuation of interest rate swaps.

37
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,360
Suppose that at the end of each period, t,

38
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,810
the floating leg of the swap pays the spot

39
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:12,070
risk-free rate over that period, which is r of t minus 1.

40
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:18,780
The fixed leg of the swap pays a fixed interest rate, r sub s.

41
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,560
The fixed rate is chosen so that the swap contract has

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,050
zero market value initially.

43
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,600
This means that no money changes hands at time 0.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,630
The swap covers t periods, with payments

45
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,910
made at the end of each period.

46
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,730
We want to use arbitrage arguments to determine

47
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,720
the fixed rate r sub s.

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,410
To do that, we first establish a useful relation

49
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,160
between the forward rates and the future spot rates.

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,680
Consider two investment strategies.

51
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Both start with $1 invested at time 0.

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,180
Under strategy 1, we initially invest $1 at the spot

53
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,660
risk-free rate until time, t.

54
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,440
Then we reinvest the proceeds for one more period

55
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,690
at the prevailing one-period spot rate at time, t.

56
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,830
Under strategy two, we also start with $1

57
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,360
and invest it at the spot risk-free rate until time, t.

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,210
Then we reinvest the proceeds for one more

59
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,810
period at the forward rate, which we'll lock in at time 0.

60
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,050
The two strategies produce different payoffs.

61
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,690
The payoff of the first strategy is random

62
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,520
and depends on the future spot rate at time, t.

63
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,360
The payoff for the second strategy is non-random.

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,250
Both of these payoffs are generated

65
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,020
with $1 initial investment.

66
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,490
So the time 0 present value of the payoff for both strategies

67
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,170
is $1.

68
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,770
Compare the payoffs of the two strategies.

69
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,310
We conclude that the time 0 present value of the cash

70
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,660
flow equal to the one-period spot trade between t and t

71
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,930
plus 1, paid at the end of that period,

72
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,420
is equal to the time 0 present value of the cash

73
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,360
flow equal to the one period forward rate

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,060
between t and t plus 1, also paid

75
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,760
at the end of the same period.

76
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,820
Recall that in contrast to the present value relation

77
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,480
that we just established, the expected value

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,530
of the future spot rate is not equal to the forward rate.

79
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,130
The reason for the difference is that the forward rate reflects

80
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,160
a risk premium in addition to the expectations

81
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
of the future spot rate.

82
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
We are now in a position to calculate the rate on the fixed

83
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,020
leg of an interest rate swap.

84
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,070
The present value of the fixed leg of the swap

85
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,730
is equal to the value of an annuity paying the fixed

86
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,800
rate for t periods, which is simply the fixed

87
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,400
rate multiplied by the sum of discount bond prices

88
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,560
with maturities from 1 to capital

89
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,070
T. The present value of the cash flows generated by the floating

90
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,970
leg of the swap is equal to the sum of present values

91
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,880
of individual payments, each of which

92
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,730
is equal to the current one-period spot interest

93
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,770
rate paid at the end of the corresponding period.

94
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,310
We impose that no money should change hands initially.

95
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,560
And therefore the time 0 present value

96
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,460
of the payments on the two legs of the swap must be the same.

97
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,970


98
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,670
As we compare the two present values,

99
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,730
we use the result we just established.

100
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,940
The present value of the future spot rate

101
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,460
is equal to the present value of the corresponding forward rate.

102
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,540
We conclude that the rate on the fixed leg of the swap

103
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,750
is equal to a weighted average of the forward rates

104
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,160
from period 1 to capital T, with the weights proportional

105
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,760
to the market prices of the corresponding discount bonds.

106
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,680
We now reinterpret our expressions

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,480
for the fixed swap rate.

108
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,050
We start with the weighted average of forward rates,

109
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,280
and use the relation between the forward rate and spot interest

110
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,660
rates, or equivalently, discount bond prices.

111
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,680
Simplifying the expression, we find that the fixed rate

112
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,540
is a ratio of two terms.

113
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,960
In the numerator, we have the difference between 1

114
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,770
and the price of the discount bond maturing at the same time

115
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,720
as the swap at time capital T.

116
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,190
In the denominator we have the sum of discount bond prices,

117
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,190
maturity from one to capital T. We

118
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,280
should note that the derived expression for the swap rate

119
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,850
is equivalent to the coupon rate on the coupon bond

120
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,420
maturing at time, t and trading at par today.

121
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,480
This equivalence follows from the highlighted equation

122
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,790
for the bond price, which imposes

123
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,950
the condition that the bond trades at par today.
