1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,260
PROFESSOR: We now consider futures on commodities.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,930
We can price commodity futures using

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,880
the same type of arbitrage argument

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,020
as for financial futures.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,540
In contrast to the financial futures,

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,240
the net payout of commodity futures

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,780
must reflect storage costs and any effective benefit

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,730
from holding the physical commodity.

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,330
This benefit is called convenience yield.

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,810
We assume that storage costs accumulate continuously

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,880
with the flow rate proportional to the market

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,770
value of the commodity.

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,500
Then, our original valuation formula

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,360
for financial forwards and futures

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,760
applies here, with the dividend yield

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,740
replaced by the net convenience yield

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,480
from holding the commodity.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,630
The net convenience yield captures

19
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,030
the benefits of storing the commodity, net

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,590
of storage costs.

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,600
As an example, consider a futures contract on gold.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,680
Gold is often held for long-term investments rather than

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,720
industrial production.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,580
We assume that storing gold produces no convenience yield.

25
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,700
Gold is also relatively easy to store.

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,730
Therefore, we assume that storage costs are negligible.

27
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,510
Under these assumptions, net convenience yield on gold

28
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,920
is equal to 0.

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,110
We conclude that the futures price of gold,

30
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,310
which is approximately the same as the forward price,

31
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,520
is equal to the current spot price, multiplied

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,880
by the exponential function of the risk-free rate,

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,610
times the time remaining until contract maturity.

34
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,470
To illustrate how well our pricing

35
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,140
formula for gold futures works in the data,

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,940
consider the gold futures contract

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,270
on the 1st of July of 2019.

38
00:01:51,270 --> 00:02:00,160
The spot price of gold at the time was $1,387.45 per ounce.

39
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,740
The futures price for the contracts maturing

40
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,640
in October of the same year, traded on the CME,

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,700
was $1,397.80 per ounce.

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,940
Based on our pricing formula for gold futures,

43
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,360
the relation between the futures price and the spot price

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,940
implies that the continuously compounded interest

45
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,530
rate is 2.23%.

46
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,330
This is very close to the rate on the three month T-bill,

47
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,760
which at the time was 2.05%.

48
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,760
Next, consider oil futures.

49
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,700
In contrast to gold, inventories of oil

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,920
are typically held for future use

51
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,800
and not for long-term investment.

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,350
Oil is also relatively costly to store.

53
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,310
This means that storage of oil incurs both benefits

54
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,860
and physical costs.

55
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,590
Our valuation equation reflects this

56
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,900
through the term representing the net convenience

57
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,730
yield on storing oil.

58
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,350
As an example, on the 19th of July of 2019,

59
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:13,170
the spot price of crude oil was $55.68 per barrel.

60
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,800
The futures price for the NYMEX contracts

61
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,230
for delivery in October of the same year

62
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,830
was $55.83 per barrel.

63
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,520
The three-month continuously compounded interest rate

64
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,210
at that time was 2.3%.

65
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,860


66
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,700
With the futures contracts being 3 and 1/2 month expiration,

67
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,480
our valuation formula implies the annualized net convenience

68
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,310
yield of 1.4%.

69
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,010
This is what market prices tell us

70
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,250
about the marginal costs and benefits of storing oil

71
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,510
at that time.

72
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,140
Based on our examples, we see that the futures prices

73
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,070
of commodity contracts may be above or below the current spot

74
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,820
price.

75
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,840
Whether futures prices increase or decline with maturity

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,270
depends on the economics of storing the underlying

77
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,770
commodity and the current state of the market and inventories.

78
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,800
When futures prices increase with maturity,

79
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,730
it is said that the forward curve is in contango.

80
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,670
Otherwise, it is in backwardation.

81
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,370
Under this definition, backwardation

82
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,570
occurs when the net convenience yield exceeds the interest

83
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,690
rate.

84
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,220
Note that sometimes definitions of contango and backwardation

85
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,800
adjust for the time value of money.

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,320
The following plot illustrates various shapes

87
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,450
of the forward curves one may observe in the market.

88
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,700
The forward curve for gold is practically flat,

89
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,650
which is consistent with the low level of the risk-free rate.

90
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,530
The curve for oil is in contango,

91
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,200
which means that the net convenience yield on storing

92
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,430
oil is relatively low.

93
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,240
In contrast, for iron ore, net convenience yield

94
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,710
is relatively high.

95
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,640
And this curve is in backwardation.

96
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,940
Finally, the forward curve for natural gas

97
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,540
shows fluctuations in relation to seasonal demand patterns.

98
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,630
Natural gas is relatively difficult to store.

99
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,610
Therefore, our pricing model is not

100
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,860
very useful for explaining prices

101
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,800
of longer-dated natural gas contracts.

102
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,950
Storage-based models are also more suitable

103
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,410
for short-dated agricultural contracts,

104
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,490
such as sweet futures than for longer dated contracts,

105
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,620
which are affected by supply from future harvests.
