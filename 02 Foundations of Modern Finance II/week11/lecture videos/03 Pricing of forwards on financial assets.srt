00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,090
PROFESSOR: In this segment, we use arbitrage arguments

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,190
to price forward contracts on financial assets.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,620
Forward contracts exist for a broad range

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,450
of underlying assets.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,960
A few examples include stock index forwards,

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,370
such as forwards on the S&P 500 index or on Nikkei.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,590
For these contracts, the underlying asset

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,290
is a basket of stocks.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,780
For forwards on fixed income assets,

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,990
the underlying asset is a fixed income instrument,

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,240
for instance a treasury bond.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,040
The interest rate forward contracts

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,220
were considered above fall into this category,

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,520
since they are equivalent to forwards on risk-free bonds.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,120
Another important example is a currency forward,

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,420
where the underlying asset is a currency.

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,900
We start with some notation.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,430
We take the current day to be time, 0.

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:01,070
The current spot price of the underlying asset is S sub-zero.

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,819
We denote the spot price of the underlying at the settlement

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,120
date of the forward, also called the maturity date,

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,390
by tilde S sub capital T. The tilde in this expression

23
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,630
reminds us that the spot price at time capital T,

24
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,280
is a random variable, not known at time 0.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,455
The forward price is F sub T. This value is known today.

26
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:29,200
The forward price is fixed today so

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,990
that the current market value of the forward contract

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,450
equals to 0.

29
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,730
We assume that the risk-free rate is constant.

30
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,010
We denote the continuously compounded interest rate by r.

31
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,620
Next, we introduce the payoff diagram

32
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,510
of the forward contract.

33
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,050
Forward contracts are derivative securities.

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,810
The payoff of a forward at the maturity date

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,970
is tied to the price of the underlying asset.

36
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,850
The payoff of the forward is a linear function

37
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,900
of the underlying price at maturity.

38
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,150
For the long position and the forward,

39
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,160
that's the perspective of the buyer,

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,250
the payoff equals the difference between the spot

41
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,830
price and the forward price.

42
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,990
For the short position, the payoff

43
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,630
is the negative of the payoff off for the long position.

44
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,830


45
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,810
We now show how to price forward contracts on financial assets.

46
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,670
We'll link forward prices to the spot prices.

47
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,800
Note that there are two ways to buy the underlying

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,470
asset for date, t delivery.

49
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,810
We can enter into a forward contract

50
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,400
with the settlement date, t.

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,060
Alternatively, we can buy the underlying asset now

52
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,630
and hold it until date, t.

53
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,070
These two strategies result in the same outcome at time, t.

54
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,110
We can use this observation to establish

55
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,140
a relation between the forward price

56
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,940
and the current spot price of the underlying asset.

57
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,090
To do that, we need to model the payout of the underlying asset.

58
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,210
Consider a financial asset paying dividends,

59
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,200
or in case of fixed income assets, coupons.

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,160
We assume that the asset pays a continuous flow of dividends,

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,510
with the flow rate proportional to the asset price.

62
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,280
In other words, the dividend yield on the asset,

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,010
which we'll call y, is constant.

64
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,920
We assume that as soon as dividends are paid,

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,240
they are immediately reinvested into the same asset.

66
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,480
As a result, the size of the position,

67
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,180
measured by the number of units of the asset,

68
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,620
grows exponentially at the rate of the dividend yield, y.

69
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,350
Suppose we start with one share of the asset

70
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,230
and reinvest the dividends continuously.

71
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,040
Then by time, t, we end up holding the exponential

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,960
of y times t shares.

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,590
Therefore to accumulate one share by time,

74
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,060
t, we need to start with exponential of minus y times

75
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,410
t shares.

76
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,100
We conclude that the present value of S sub T, which

77
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,160
is the price of one share at time, t,

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,720
is equal to the current value of the exponential of minus y

79
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,390
times T shares, or exponential of minus y times T

80
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,580
times the current spot price.

81
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,460
We are now ready to determine the arbitrage free forward

82
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,120
price.

83
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,040
Consider the payoff of the forward contract at maturity.

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,860
We take the perspective of the buyer.

85
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,530
The payoff is the difference between the spot

86
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,060
price of the underlying asset at maturity and the forward price.

87
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,510
The forward price is set so that the market

88
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,910
value of the forward contract today is 0.

89
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,280
This means that the present value of the payoff

90
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,080
of the forward contract is 0.

91
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,290
We have derived the present value of the time, t spot price

92
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,700
above.

93
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,220
The present value of the forward price

94
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,420
is simply an adjustment for the time value of money.

95
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,020
We conclude that the forward price

96
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,260
is a product of the current spot price

97
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,680
and the exponential function of the difference

98
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,760
between the risk-free interest rate

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,990
and the yield on the underlying asset times t,

100
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,910
which is time to maturity.

101
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,790
Based on our derivation of the forward price,

102
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,570
we can see how to replicate the payoff of the forward contract.

103
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,370
Again, consider the long position in the forward.

104
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,970
We replicate two components of the forward's payoff.

105
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,090
To obtain the payoff at maturity equal to the spot

106
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,490
price of the underlying asset, we

107
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,100
buy the exponential of minus y times

108
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,780
T units of the underlying asset today and reinvest

109
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,690
the dividends back into the asset continuously

110
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,510
until maturity.

111
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,780
To obtain the payoff at maturity equal to the negative

112
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,410
of the forward price, we borrow the present value

113
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,930
of the forward price.

114
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,740
This result in trading strategy has zero initial value

115
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,590
and produces a payoff equal to the payoff

116
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,610
of the forward contract at maturity.

117
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,070
As an application of our results,

118
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,340
consider an example of a forward contract on the stock index.

119
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,550
The underlying asset is a basket of stocks,

120
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,750
which pays dividends.

121
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,350
Our task is to learn about the future dividend yield

122
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,540
from current market prices.

123
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,130
We're given the following data.

124
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,370
These numbers are for illustration purposes.

125
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,340
Suppose it is currently the end of June

126
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,000
and the S&P 500 index just closed at 3,000.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,940
There exists a forward contract on the S&P 500

128
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,260
index with the settlement date at the end of September.

129
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,240
This is three months from now.

130
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,320
The most recent forward price is 2,995.

131
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,380
The three-month continuously the compounded interest rate

132
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,300
is 1.5%.

133
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,480


134
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,810
We start with the relation between the forward price

135
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,060
and the current spot price, which

136
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,580
includes, among other variables, the dividend

137
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,660
yield on the underlying asset.

138
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,260
Inverting the formula, we find that the implied dividend

139
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,500
yield is 2.17%.

140
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,000
