1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,030
PROFESSOR: We now consider a currency forward

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,870
and connect currency forward prices to exchange rates

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,490
and interest rates.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,190
A currency forward is a forward contract

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,860
to exchange a unit of one currency

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,830
for a specified number of units of another currency.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,240
For example, one may enter into a contract to exchange one

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,410
Swiss franc for a specified number of US dollars,

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,729
say $1.10 three years from now.

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,430
This number is the forward exchange rate,

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,860
and it depends on contract maturity.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,580
For contracts with shorter or longer maturities,

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,450
forward rates differ.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,940
We can use our previous results on pricing

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,140
of financial forwards to determine how forward exchange

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,020
rates are related to the spot exchange rates

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,410
and risk-free interest rates in the two currencies.

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,120
Suppose the forward price is F sub T US dollars for one

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,700
Swiss Franc, where the forward contract

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:13,760
matures at time T. Let X sub T denote the spot exchange rate.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,030
This is the current price of one Swiss Franc in US dollars.

22
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:26,570
Consider the two risk-free rates rUSD and rCHF.

23
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,740
These are continuously compounded spot interest rates

24
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,680
for investments between now and time, capital T,

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,600
in US dollars and Swiss francs, respectively.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,870
Consider a position with Swiss francs invested

27
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,890
at the Swiss risk-free rate.

28
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,560
The number of Swiss francs in the position

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,340
grows exponentially between now and time T

30
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,790
at the Swiss risk-free rate.

31
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,680
We conclude that for the purposes

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,700
of pricing a forward contract, the Swiss franc position

33
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,270
is equivalent to a financial asset with a dividend

34
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,669
yield equal to the Swiss interest rate.

35
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,220
We conclude that the forward exchange rate

36
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,950
is given by the relation we have established

37
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,880
above for financial forwards.

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,180
The forward exchange rate is a product of the spot exchange

39
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,530
rate, X at time 0, and the exponential

40
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,740
of the time to maturity of the contract multiplied

41
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,610
by the difference between the two risk-free rates, the US

42
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,290
dollar rate minus the Swiss franc rate.

43
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,100
This relation between the forward exchange rate, the spot

44
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,190
exchange rate, and the two interest rates

45
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,530
is called the covered interest rate parity.

46
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,580
This is a no arbitrage relation.

47
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,220
To replicate the payoff of the currency forward,

48
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,620
we again refer to our general results for financial forwards.

49
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,580
At time 0, we performed the following transactions.

50
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,560
First, we borrow a dollar amount equal to the forward exchange

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,970
rate, scaled by an exponential function of time to maturity,

52
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,020
multiplied by the negative of the US interest rate.

53
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,010
Note that given the expression for the forward rate,

54
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,220
this dollar amount is equal to the spot exchange rate

55
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,690
X, scaled by an exponential function of time to maturity,

56
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,440
multiplied by the negative of the Swiss interest rate.

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Second, we convert the borrowed amount

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,350
into Swiss francs at the spot exchange rate today.

59
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,550
Third, we invest the proceeds at the Swiss risk-free interest

60
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,740
rate until time T. By the maturity date of the forward,

61
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,990
the long position in Swiss francs

62
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,430
grows in value to one Swiss franc.

63
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,060
At the same time, the borrowed dollar amount results

64
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,480
in the cash flow equal to the negative of the forward price.

65
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,390
The bottom line, we have replicated the payoff

66
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,090
of the forward contract using transactions

67
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,970
in the spot markets.
