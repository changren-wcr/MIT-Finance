00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,030
PROFESSOR: In this lecture, we introduce an important class

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,680
of derivative securities-- forwards, futures, and swaps.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,650
We'll go over the main properties of these securities

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,570
and discuss how they can be priced.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,850
Our approach to valuation is based

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,040
on the principle of no arbitrage,

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,260
or the law of one price.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,960
In each case, we aim to replicate the cash

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,430
flows of a derivative security by trading in other assets.

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,940
This allows us to establish a unique arbitrage-free price

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,960
for the derivative.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,000
In this manner, we connect forward

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,670
interest rates to the spot rates,

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,570
futures prices, or financial futures to the current price

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,040
of the underlying asset, and the terms of an interest rate swap

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,810
contract with the current yield curve, among other results.

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,450
Financial contracts-- with many features

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,840
found in modern derivatives, such as forward, futures,

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,400
and options, date back to the early periods of human history.

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,160
In ancient Mesopotamia, over 3,000 years ago,

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,480
farmers and merchants entered into financial contracts,

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,610
making arrangements for future delivery

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,880
of grain or other commodities.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,910
The contract would describe both the details of future delivery,

25
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,680
such as quantity of the goods and the price.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,020
These contracts are what we now know as forward contracts.

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,970
Let us begin with the formal definition

28
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,260
of the forward contract.

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,360
A forward contract is a commitment

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,280
to buy or sell a given quantity of a commodity or an asset

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,910
at a future date at the price specified today.

32
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,100
The key feature of the contract is

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,120
that the price is fixed today, while the transaction itself

34
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,820
takes place in the future.

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,080
This contractual price is called the forward price.

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,420
At the settlement date of the contract,

37
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,140
the buyer pays the forward price and collects the underlying

38
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,160
asset--

39
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,270
a financial asset or a commodity.

40
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,580
The buyer thus obtains a long position

41
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,860
in the asset or commodity.

42
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,300
As an example, consider a forward contract on soybeans.

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,430
Suppose that the tofu manufacturer

44
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,180
needs 100,000 bushels of soybeans in 3 months.

45
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,800
The current price of soybeans in the market,

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,550
which we call the spot price, is $12.50 per bushel.

47
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,360
Going forward, this price may rise or fall.

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,340
Our producer of tofu wants to make

49
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,640
sure that 100,000 bushels will be available 3 month from now.

50
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,160
To remove any uncertainty about the price,

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,550
the producer enters into a 3-month forward contract

52
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,780
for 100,000 bushels of soybeans at $13.50 per bushel.

53
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,430
In this forward transaction, the long side buys 100,000 bushels

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,870
from the short side at $13.50 per bushel in 3 month

55
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,230
at the settlement date.

56
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,020
Forward contracts have several important features.

57
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,340
First, forwards are typically traded over the counter.

58
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,430
This means that buyers and sellers transact

59
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,310
with each other directly, as opposed to trading

60
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,990
on centralized exchanges.

61
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,160
Second, forward contracts can be easily customized.

62
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,860
The two parties-- the buyer and the seller--

63
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,340
can agree on various terms of the contract as they desire.

64
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,910
These contracts do not need to be standardized.

65
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,990
Third, no money changes hands until contact maturity,

66
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,570
or the settlement date.

67
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,850
The properties of the forward contracts

68
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,780
create some advantages and some limitations.

69
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,630
One of the advantages of forwards

70
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,080
is that, because these contracts are highly customizable,

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,850
they can be adapted to individual needs,

72
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,790
making them effective for risk management and speculation.

73
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,700
In addition, because no money changes hands

74
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,550
until the settlement date, counterparties

75
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,190
in the forward contract do not need to come up

76
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,840
with funds until that date.

77
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,839
This is convenient, for example, for a farmer trying

78
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,970
to fix the sale price of his harvest

79
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,380
in advance through a forward contract.

80
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,780
One of the disadvantages of forwards

81
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,880
is that the over-the-counter customized

82
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,150
nature of these contracts makes them relatively illiquid.

83
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,360
It is costly for one of the counterparties in the forward

84
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,260
to get out of the contract prior to its settlement.

85
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,140
Moreover, the fact that money does not change hands

86
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,010
during the life of the contract means that all gains and losses

87
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,350
are realized at the settlement date, which

88
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,920
creates counterparty risk.

89
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,120
The risk is that the losing side of the contract

90
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,880
may not fulfill their obligations at the settlement

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,040
date.

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,340
To prevent this, participants in the forward contract

93
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,590
need to post collateral, which they

94
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,020
would lose in the event of failing to honor

95
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,240
the terms of the contract.

96
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,330
This collateral requirement makes

97
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,650
it harder to enter into a forward contract.
