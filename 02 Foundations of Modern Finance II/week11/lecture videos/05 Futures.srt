1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,760
PROFESSOR: We now introduce futures contracts.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,220
A futures contract is an exchange

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,130
traded standardized financial contract

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,510
similar to the forward.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,820
The main distinction from the forwards

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,930
is that futures contracts are marked to market daily.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,810
We will discuss the details of the mark

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,550
to market process in a minute.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,460
Unlike the forwards, futures contracts are standardized.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,060
Terms of futures contracts include the description

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,050
of the underlying commodity or asset, the quantity

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,450
of the underlying to be delivered,

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,340
and the settlement or maturity date.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,570
Futures contracts also specify the type of settlement.

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,970
Some contracts involve physical delivery

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,340
of the underlying asset.

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,770
For other contracts, physical delivery

18
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,000
is not desirable or not possible.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,700
Such contracts are settled in cash.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,250
For instance, consider a futures contract

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,900
on the stock market index.

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,530
Physical delivery would involve delivering all the stocks

23
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,120
in the index.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,630
Instead, such contracts can be settled in cash,

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,620
based on the value of the index at contract maturity.

26
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,660
Futures contracts trade on a number

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,030
of centralized exchanges.

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,840
Some of the largest exchanges are the CME group,

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,120
the National Stock Exchange of India,

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,520
the Intercontinental Exchange, the CBOE, and Eurex.

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,780
Trading in futures involves little counterparty risk

32
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,200
because all trades on exchanges go through the clearinghouse.

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,970
While we think of a futures contract

34
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,100
as a financial transaction between the buyer

35
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,580
and the seller, in reality each transaction

36
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,160
is broken into two major transactions.

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,740
The clearinghouse acts as the counter party

38
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,390
to both the buyer and the seller.

39
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,340
This significantly reduces the risk

40
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,110
of counterparty default faced by the market participants.

41
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,720
Gains and losses on futures positions

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,390
are recognized, or marked to market, daily.

43
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,980
Daily gains and losses are settled

44
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,490
using the margin accounts.

45
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,400
To make sure that this process functions properly,

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,890
buyers and sellers of futures are

47
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,560
required to maintain a certain level of collateral

48
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
in their margin accounts.

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,280
As an example, consider a futures contract

50
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,700
on crude oil traded on NYMEX.

51
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,150
This contract specifies the delivery date and the futures

52
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,270
price.

53
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,260
Each contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.

54
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:52,080
In this example, the initial margin is $3,960.

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,360
To enter into the futures contract,

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,540
both the buyer and the seller must deposit this amount

57
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,320
into their margin accounts.

58
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,770
Note that this amount represents a small fraction

59
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,800
of the value of oil covered by a single contract.

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,740
This allows futures traders to achieve

61
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,920
large economic exposures with limited capital.

62
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,590
In other words, futures contracts

63
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,990
allow for a significant degree of leverage.

64
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,400
The maintenance margin is $3,600.

65
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,440
This is a trigger.

66
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,540
Once the balance in the margin account

67
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,270
falls below the maintenance margin,

68
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,990
traders are required to restore the margin balance to the level

69
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,260
of the initial margin.

70
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,890
Alternatively, their position may be reduced or liquidated.

71
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,320
When traders enter into this contract,

72
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,790
no cash changes hands.

73
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,220
The total market value of the contract is zero.

74
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,450
We say that the buyer holds a long position.

75
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,650
The long positions gains if the futures price rises.

76
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,550
The seller holds a short position and benefits

77
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,170
from price declines.

78
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,250
Next, let's take a closer look at the mark to market process,

79
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,320
and the cash flows it generates.

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,920
We will compare a futures contract to a forward.

81
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,220
We start with the forward.

82
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,730
This is a contract on 1,000 ounces of gold.

83
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,910
Suppose the current date is December 12,

84
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,220
and the buyer and the seller enter

85
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,380
into the forward contract maturing

86
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,600
on the 15th of December.

87
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,540
The two counterparties entered into the contract

88
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,580
with the forward price of $500 per ounce.

89
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,010
No money changes hands until the settlement date, December 15.

90
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,860
On the 15th, the buyer pays the seller

91
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,460
$500 per ounce for 1,000 ounces of gold

92
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,680
and the seller delivers gold to the buyer.

93
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,740
Next, consider the futures contract.

94
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,510
The parameters are the same.

95
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,690
The buyer and the seller enter into the contract

96
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:10,780
on December 12 with the futures price of $500 per ounce.

97
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,130
Later that day, the futures contract closes at $495

98
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,400
per ounce.

99
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,990
That is the settlement price for that day.

100
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,070
This represents a gain of $5 per ounce for the seller

101
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,530
and the corresponding loss for the buyer.

102
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,740
The next day, on December 13, the buyer

103
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,240
will see $5 per ounce deducted from her margin account,

104
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,490
and the seller will have $5 per ounce

105
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,050
credited to the margin account.

106
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:56,840


107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,780
Suppose that on the 13th, the futures contract

108
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,010
settles at $491 per ounce.

109
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,190
This is a $4 per ounce gain for the seller

110
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,780
and the loss for the buyer.

111
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,130
The next day $4 per ounce is deducted from the buyer's

112
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,470
margin account, and the same amount

113
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,170
is credited to the seller's account.

114
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,570
The above process of daily settlement

115
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,580
continues until the maturity date of the contract.

116
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,090
On December 16, two things happen.

117
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,770
First, the buyer gains $1 per ounce,

118
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,470
and the seller loses the same amount

119
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,450
due to the most recent price change

120
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,760
relative to the previous day close.

121
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,120
This is the last mark-to-market transaction on this contract.

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,160
Second, the seller transfers 1,000 ounces of gold

123
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,000
to the buyer, and the buyer pays the settlement price

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,010
on the previous day, which is $498 per ounce.

125
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,150
Note that the cumulative gain or loss on the futures contract

126
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,670
is the same as on the forward.

127
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,910
It is $2 per ounce, based on the difference

128
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,510
between the initial futures price of $500

129
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,190
and the closing price of $498 on December 15.

130
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,970
The difference between forwards and futures is in timing.

131
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,420
Under the forward contract, the total gain or loss

132
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,650
are realized at contract maturity.

133
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,920
Under the futures contract, gains and losses

134
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,430
are realized incrementally, with daily mark-to-market

135
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,530
throughout the life of the contract.

136
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,050
Both forwards and futures prices are

137
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,640
linked to the spot price of the underlying asset.

138
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,010
The difference between the two contracts

139
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,470
is in the timing of cash flows due

140
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,670
to the mark-to-market process for futures.

141
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,620
In this class, we ignore the effect

142
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,330
of mark-to-market on pricing.

143
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,090
We assume that the futures price, which

144
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,240
would denote by H sub T is approximately

145
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,950
equal to the forward price.

146
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,200
Know that futures and forward prices

147
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,470
may not be the same under stochastic interest rates,

148
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,140
in which case one needs to develop separate pricing

149
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,610
results for the futures contracts.
