PROFESSOR: In our discussion of financing so far,

1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,460
we have taken the firm's investment decision,

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,310
or its asset, as given.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,920
Towards the later part of our discussion

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,890
we have learned that the nature of its asset

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,530
may well influence the firm's risk

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,080
and cause financial distress if it takes on debt.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,890
This suggests a potential connection between investment

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,380
and financing.

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,040
In this lecture, we want to consider this connection.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,410
In particular, we want to examine

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,630
how financing may interact with a firm's investment decision.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,480
This is because a project's asset

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,130
may bring actual debt capacity, which can bring tax shield

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,850
and increase firm value.

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,480
Therefore, our main question is how

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,980
to value a project, taking into account how it can be financed,

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,600
and the additional benefit it brings.
