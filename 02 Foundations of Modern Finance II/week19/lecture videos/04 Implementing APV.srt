1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,910
PROFESSOR: We now turn to the implementation of the APV

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,740
approach.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,070
Suppose that we want to value a project given

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,650
its after-tax cash flow.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,110
We need to value its two pieces.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,100
The first piece is the value of its after-tax cash flow.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,210
The second piece is the value of the tax shield

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,540
at a desirable leverage level.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,670
We can follow the following steps.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,030
The first step is to find the right discount

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,500
rate for the after-tax cash flow from the asset.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,310
We do so by first finding a traded firm

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,560
with the same business risk.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,610
Suppose we have the following data, its debt to equity ratio

15
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,380
is D over E. the required rate of return on its equity

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:57,690
and debt, respectively, using CAPM or APT, and then its tax

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,740
rate, we can then uncover the required rate

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,920
of return on this reference firm's asset,

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,940
rA, that is the discount rate without leverage.

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,000
Applying rA to the after tax cash flow,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,790
we obtain VU for the project.

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,960
We then compute the present value of the debt's tax shield

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,180
at a desirable safe debt level.

24
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,740
Finally, we compute the projects APV.

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,400
As we can see, the key step in this approach

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,890
is to uncover rA from the data on the leveraged firm.

27
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,200
In order to do so, we need to make

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,370
several simplifying assumptions.

29
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,820
First, we assume that the pre-tax payout

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,550
of the firm or the project grows geometrically,

31
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:56,740
that is Xt equals Xt minus 1 times gt, where gt is the IID

32
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,670
growth rate with mean g.

33
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,400
As an example, the binomial process

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,410
is such a process, where gt takes two possible values.

35
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,820
We also know that, in this case, the risk of payout

36
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,240
compounds over time at a constant rate, which

37
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,570
is more compatible with constant discount rates,

38
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,470
as we discussed in lecture 16.

39
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,040
We're also going to assume the time period is short.

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,550
The firm rebalances its debt each period

41
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,180
to maintain a constant debt to equity ratio.

42
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,650
Under these assumptions, the value of the project's asset

43
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,070
is given by the following equation on the slide.

44
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,450
VUt, the value of the unlevered firm at time t,

45
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,460
equals the sum from s equal to 1 to infinity 1 minus tau times

46
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,950
Xt times g to the power of s.

47
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,710
Then divide by 1 plus rA raised to the power of s.

48
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:13,730
That also equals 1 minus tau times Xt divide by rA minus g.

49
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,070
Therefore, VUt is proportional to Xt.

50
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,810
Moreover, VUt evolves proportionally with Xt.

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,100
Now let's consider the firm's asset and liability.

52
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:40,330
VLt equals Dt plus Et which also equals to VUt plus PVTSt, Where

53
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,010
PVTSt is the present value of the tax shield from leverage

54
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,420
at time t.

55
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,340
We then have the following equation

56
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,910
on the expected return on the firm and its different pieces.

57
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,610
rL which is return on the levered firm,

58
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,020
equals Dt divided by VLt, the relative weight of debt,

59
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,740
times rD plus Et divide by VLt, the relative weight of equity,

60
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,320
times rE.

61
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,430
This can also be written as VUt divided

62
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:27,040
by VUt plus PVTSt times rA plus PVTSt divided by VUt plus PVTSt

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,470
times rTS, where rTS is the expected rate of return

64
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,160
on PVTS.

65
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,850


66
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,250
A critical observation at this point

67
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,880
is that because constant debt to equity ratio, the risk of PVTS

68
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,960
is virtually the same as the risk of the firm's asset value,

69
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:58,710
VUt, if time period is short, that is rTS equals rA.

70
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,390
This greatly simplifies the valuation of tax shield.

71
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,080
For the same reason, PVTS and the firm's asset

72
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,450
also have the same beta.

73
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,250
Beta TS equals beta A.

74
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,010
Given the results above, we then have

75
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:23,000
rL equals Dt divide by VLt times rD plus Et divided

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,960
by VLt times rE, which equals wD times rD plus wE

77
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,380
times rE, which equals rA.

78
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,690
The required rate of return on equity

79
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,470
for the levered firm as stated in MM II with taxes is rE

80
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:49,350
equals rA plus D over E times rA minus rD.

81
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:56,400
Under CAPM, we even have that beta of L equals wD times beta

82
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:04,000
D plus wE times beta E, which also equals the beta of A.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,390
Is important to know that this relationship is

84
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,180
the same as what we obtained previously

85
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,710
under the assumption of no tax shield from leverage.

86
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,600
But here the tax shield from leverage is included.

87
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,550
The formula still holds.

88
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,000
This is because under the stated assumptions,

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,580
the risk of tax shield generated by debt

90
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,500
has the same risk as the firm's asset.
