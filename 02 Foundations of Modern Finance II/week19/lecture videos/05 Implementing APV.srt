1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,940
PROFESSOR: We now consider an example

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,380
to illustrate how the approach laid out above is implemented.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,850
We are considering buying SuperSoft, a software company.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,700
We have the following information.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,500
SuperSoft is currently privately held and 100% equity financed.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,650
Its projected annual pre-tax cash flow

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,060
is $1.5 million perpetually.

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,290
SuperSoft faces an effective tax rate of 30%.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,900
Its assets can sustain a debt level of 20% of its asset value

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,540
without significant distress cost.

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,080
The risk-free interest rate is 5%,

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,000
which is also what SuperSoft pays on its debt.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,760
In addition, there are two publicly-traded software

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,370
companies: 1 and 2.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,540
Their financial data is given in a table on the slide.

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,560
For firm 1, which is described in the second row,

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,960
its required rate of return on equity

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,180
is 24.31%, given in the second column.

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,550
Its required rate of return on debt

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,840
is 6.95%, given in the third column.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,670
Its debt-to-equity ratio is 0.5, given in the fourth column,

22
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:31,950
and its tax rate is 0.34, or 34%, given in the last column.

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,180
For firm 2, as given in the third row,

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,170
its required rate of return on equity and debt

25
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,630
are 29.07% and 9.88%, respectively.

26
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,980
It's debt-to-equity ratio is 1.2.

27
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,790
And its tax rate is 0.30.

28
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,140
Our first task is to uncover the required rate of return

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,930
for the assets of these two firms

30
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,370
and then use it to value SuperSoft.

31
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,530
Using MM II with taxes, we can uncover the required rate

32
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,430
of return on the asset of firm 1 and 2,

33
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:22,700
which are rA1 equals 18.51% and rA2 equals 18.60%.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,050
Take the average.

35
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,350
We have rA equals 18.56%.

36
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,630
Using it to value SuperSoft's asset or after-tax cash flow,

37
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,750
we have its value without the leverage effect.

38
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,980
That is, VU equals 1 minus 0.3--

39
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,410
that's tax rate-- times 1.5--

40
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,030
that's the pre-tax cash flow--

41
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,760
divided by the discount rate, which is 0.1856.

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,290
That gives us $5.66 million.

43
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,040
Its value with leverage at 20% leverage ratio

44
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,650
is then given by VL equals VU plus PVTS,

45
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,270
and that equals 5.66 plus 0.3--

46
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,410
again, the tax rate--

47
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,180
times 0.05, the interest rate, times 0.2, the debt ratio,

48
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,160
times 5.66--

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,560
the asset value without leverage--

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,290
and then discounted by 0.1856.

51
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,150
That gives us $5.75 million.

52
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,680
Therefore, by using the debt capacity of the asset,

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,140
we can increase the value of the firm

54
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:41,370
by the PVTS, which is 5.75 minus 5.66.

55
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,650
And that is $0.09 million.
