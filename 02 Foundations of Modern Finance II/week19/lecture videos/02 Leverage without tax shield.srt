00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,080
PROFESSOR: As we have seen in the 415Inc.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,930
example in the last lecture, in order

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,630
to value the effect of leverage, we

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,210
need to know how to value its tax benefit and distress cost.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,960
This requires us to know the proper discount

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,530
rates for the corresponding cash flows.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,210
For this purpose, we need to properly specify their risks

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,930
or their evolution over time.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,990
We start by introducing some notation.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,040
Let Xt denote the cash flow from the firm's asset

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,730
at time t, which is independent of leverage.

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:48,610
Vut denote the value of the firm without leverage at time t.

13
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:54,760
Vlt denote the value of the firm with leverage at time t.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,700
Dt denote the value of its debt at t,

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,540
and Et denote the value of its equity at t.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,239
ra denote the required rate of return

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,480
on the firm's asset or the unlevered firm.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,650
rl denote the required rate of return on the levered firm.

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,710
rd denote the required rate of return also

20
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,650
the expected interest rate on the firm's debt

21
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,300
when it's levered.

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,020
re denote the required rate of return on equity.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,580
Tau denote the firm's tax rate.

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,460
We will start with the situation without the tax

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,380
shield from debt.

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,860
Then MM holds in its benchmark form,

27
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,360
which implies the following.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,800
First, a firm's asset can be viewed simply

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,100
as a portfolio of its debt and equity.

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,880
That is, V equals D plus E.

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,570
Next, asset return equals the weighted average

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,330
of the returns of debt and equity, which is the WACC.

33
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:02,060
That is given by ra equals D divided by D plus E, that's

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,970
the weight of debt, times rd, then plus E divided

35
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,590
by D plus E times re, and that's the WACC

36
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,720
as we have defined before.

37
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,520
The value of the firm is then given

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,070
by the following equation, V equals D plus E. That equals

39
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:24,830
the sum from x equal to 1 to infinity, 1 minus tau

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,310
times Xs, that's the after-tax cash flow,

41
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,150
divided by 1 plus ra, the asset discount

42
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,200
rate, raised to the power of s.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,400
And this discounted sum of future cash flows

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,740
equals Vu, the unlevered firm, which also equals the sum from

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,510
s equal to 1 to infinity 1 minus tau times Xs divided

46
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,310
by 1 plus WACC raised to the power of s.

47
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,100
And as we know, that also equals the value of the levered firm.

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,370
We also have a MM II, the firm's cost of capital with leverage,

49
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,910
is re equals ra plus D over E, the debt to equity ratio,

50
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,480
times ra minus rd.

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,700
In particular, we have ra is independent of D over E,

52
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,500
or leverage.

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,540
It is given only by the firm's asset.

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,570
re increases with D over E, assuming debt is risk-free.

55
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,170
rd may also increase with D over E as debt becomes risky.
