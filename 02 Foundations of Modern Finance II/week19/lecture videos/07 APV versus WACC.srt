00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,220
PROFESSOR: Our discussion above clearly

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,810
shows that in the presence of frictions, such as taxes

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,080
and distress cost, investment and financing become connected.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,375
In valuing a project, not only do

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:19,360
we need to consider the NPV of its asset,

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,510
we also need to take into account

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,830
the debt capacity of the asset, and the value of the benefits

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,600
and costs from leverage.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,110
Therefore, in general, we should consider a firm's investment

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,810
and financing decisions jointly.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,420
In doing so, we have developed two approaches.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,090
One is the APV approach and the other is the WACC approach.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,090
In the example discussed last, we

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,850
have seen how each of the two approaches

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,750
can be implemented to make the investment and financing

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,750
decision together.

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,210
If done properly, the two approaches

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,640
lead to the same answer.

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,360
Before concluding, we would like to say a few words

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,220
about the pros and cons of these two approaches.

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,780
We start with WACC, as it's pretty well-known.

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,800
The WACC approach has several advantages.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,630
First, it's fairly widely used.

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,970
Second, it requires fewer computations

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,920
if we have the right inputs.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,550
Third, it seems more straightforward and intuitive

27
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,630
to understand and explain.

28
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,620
But really, as we have seen, it's actually not that obvious

29
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,280
as we think more about it.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,580
WACC has some serious drawbacks.

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,680
First, it mixes the effects of asset and liability.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,100
Errors and approximations in the liability effect

33
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,710
will contaminate valuation, especially

34
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,900
the valuation of asset.

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,650
Second, it is in some sense artificially constructed,

36
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,070
and hence, not very flexible.

37
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,930
It is harder to be adapted to more complex situations,

38
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,460
such as nonconstant debt ratios, cost

39
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,580
of hybrid securities like convertibles,

40
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,280
other effects of financing, like the cost of distress,

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,190
and personal taxes.

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's now look at APV.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,100
It has several clear advantages.

44
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,780
First, it's clear on where value comes from--

45
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,250
asset, tax shield, and cost of distress.

46
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,250
There's no mix between different effects.

47
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,310
And hence, there's no cross-contamination

48
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,290
in errors and approximations.

49
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,300
Third, it's more flexible.

50
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,240
Different effects can be added as separate items.

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,080


52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,260
APV's main disadvantage, if there is one,

53
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,420
is that it's not widely used yet.

54
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,180
But both conceptually and operationally,

55
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,220
it is the right approach, and should

56
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,975
be followed whenever possible.

57
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:17,530


58
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,660
Overall, for complex, changing, or highly levered capital

59
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,760
structure like LBOs, APV is much better.

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,860
Under the right circumstances, it

61
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,430
does not matter which method is used, if done correctly.
