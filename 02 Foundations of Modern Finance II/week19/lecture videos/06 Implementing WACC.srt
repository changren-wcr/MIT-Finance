1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,890
PROFESSOR: For the same example, we

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,950
now consider how to use the WACC approach to value SuperSoft.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,920
The value of SuperSoft's asset is Vu.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,960
That's $5.66 million given before.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,980
It is independent of leverage.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,250
The debt is safe at 20% of the asset value.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,070
This gives D equals 0.2 times Vu.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,300
Since the debt is risk free, the interest rate on the debt

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,240
is the risk-free rate rf, which is 5%.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,220
The present value of the tax shield

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,680
is then PVTS equals tau times rf times D.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,370
That's the total interest payment divide by rA.

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:55,760
And that equals 0.3 times 0.05 interest rate divide

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,130
by 0.1856, the discount rate, then

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:07,790
times the total value of the debt, which is 0.2 times Vu.

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,660
Summarizing this, we have 0.016 times vu.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,160
The value of equity with leverage

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:26,690
is E equals vu plus PVTS minus D. That equals 1 plus 0.016

19
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,960
minus 0.2 times vu.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,090
And that equals 0.816 times vu.

21
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,400
We then have the weight of debt WD equals 0.2 divide

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,090
by 0.2 plus 0.816.

23
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,700
And that is 0.2 divide by 1.016.

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:57,720
The weight of equity equals 0.816 divided by 1.016.

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,390
The required rate of return on equity is then given by rE

26
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,910
equals rA plus D over E times rA minus rD.

27
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,660
That's the MM II with taxes.

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:23,720
And that equals 18.56% plus 0.2 divide by 0.816 times 18.56%.

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,646
And that gives us 21.88%.

30
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:32,270
We can now compute the WACC for SuperSoft

31
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,780
with the leverage level and its tax shield.

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:44,450
WACC equals 0.2 times 1 minus 0.3 divide by 1.016 times

33
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:52,550
5%, the risk-free rate, plus 0.816 divided by 1.016 times

34
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,830
21.88%.

35
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,270
And that equals 18.26%.

36
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,660
Using the WACC, which is adjusted for tax shield,

37
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,820
the value of the lumber firm is given

38
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,480
by vL equals 1 minus 0.3, the tax rate, times 1.5,

39
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,630
the pretax cash flow, divide by WACC.

40
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:22,520
And that is 1 minus 0.3 times 1.5 divided by 0.1826,

41
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,780
and that gives us $5.75 billion.

42
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,290
Clearly, we all get the same answer as using APV.

43
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,280
With WACC, we can apply it to similar projects

44
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,800
with the same financing structure assuming

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,780
it's optimal.

46
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,390
It cannot be blindly applied to different projects,

47
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,740
which may have different discount rates for the assets

48
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,900
and different optimal leverage levels.

49
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,150
Before we move on, let's take a look

50
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,660
at some data concerning leverage and WACC

51
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,120
across different industries.

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,120
The table on the slide reports the debt ratio

53
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,130
that's debt to asset, equity beta, asset beta, and WACC

54
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,130
for a sample of industries.

55
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,910
The leverage ratio is higher at the top and decreases

56
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,480
over as we go down the list.

57
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,519
The second row is for the electric and gas industry.

58
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,530
As that ratio is 43.2% as we said before,

59
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,950
its equity beta is 0.58.

60
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,380
And its asset beta is 0.33, which is quite a bit lower

61
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,810
than the equity beta.

62
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,520
Using a risk-free rate of 6%, a market risk premium of 8%,

63
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,740
a cost of debt of 7.5%, and a tax rate of 35%,

64
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,470
we obtained the WACC for this industry to be 8.1%.

65
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,680
The third row gives the same information for the food

66
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,540
production industry.

67
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,570
Its debt ratio is 22.90%.

68
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:08,920
The equity and asset betas are 0.85% and 0.66% respectively.

69
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,500
And the WACC for this industry is 11.0%.

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,990
If we go to the sixth row, it is for retailers.

71
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,030
This industry has a debt ratio of 21.70%.

72
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:29,780
The equity and asset betas are 1.19 and 0.93 respectively.

73
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,930
The WACC is 13.2%

74
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,650
The eighth row is for the computer software industry.

75
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,230
Its debt ratio is 3.50%, which is very low for reasons we

76
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,180
explained before.

77
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,840
Its equity and asset betas are 1.33 and 1.28 respectively.

78
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,000
The industry WACC is 16.2%.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,250
Looking down the list, we see the following patterns.

80
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:08,570
First, asset betas increases as we see from the fourth column.

81
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,060
This is how the industries are arranged

82
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,220
in the table in the first place.

83
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,130
Correspondingly, the debt ratio decreases

84
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,820
as the second column shows for reasons we have discussed

85
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,340
in the previous lecture.

86
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,160
The equity beta given in the third column

87
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,830
is always higher than asset beta as stated by MM.

88
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,950
But the difference decreases as we go down the list.

89
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,360
This reflects the fact that leverage is decreasing

90
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,990
as asset beta increases.

91
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,890
In general, WACC increases with asset beta

92
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,290
as the last column shows.

93
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,840
The 10th row in the table gives the average

94
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,320
numbers across all industries.

95
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,410
The average debt ratio is 21.50%.

96
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,180
The asset beta is 0.82.

97
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,800
The equity beta is 1.04 as expected.

98
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,500
The average WACC is 12.3%.

99
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,000
