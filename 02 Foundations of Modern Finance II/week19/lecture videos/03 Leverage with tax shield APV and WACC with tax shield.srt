1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,830
PROFESSOR: We now add the debt's tax shield into the analysis.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,090
Now MM becomes VL, the value of the levered firm,

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,880
equals D plus E equals VU, the value of the unlevered firm,

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,510
plus PVTS, the Present Value of Tax Shield minus,

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,580
PVDC, the Present Value of Default Cost,

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,600
and that, as we know, is the APV, the Adjusted Present

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,470
Value.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,250
For simplicity we ignore the cost of default

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,710
for the rest of our discussion here,

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,440
assuming debt is mostly risk-free.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,380
We can then think of the firm or the project

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,550
with leverage in two equivalent ways, which is shown

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,740
in the following equation.

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,170
VL, the value of levered firm, equals E plus D,

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,110
Debt plus Equity, which also equals

16
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:02,750
VU, the value of the unlevered firm, plus PVTS

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,780
and that's the APV.

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,990
The first part of the equation expresses it

19
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,620
as a portfolio of debt and equity.

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,870
The second part of the equation views it

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,070
as a portfolio of two assets.

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,880
One is an asset with payoff identical to that

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,790
of the project after tax.

24
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,990
The other is an asset with payoff identical to the tax

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,200
shield of debt.

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,790
In order to value these two cash flows, one from the project

27
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,910
or asset and the other from tax shield,

28
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,210
we need to find their discount rates.

29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,410
For this we need to specify their time evolution, which

30
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,800
also specifies their risks.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,980
We have discussed this issue when we discussed the link

32
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,920
between risk and the horizon in Capital Budgeting

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,290
II in Lecture 16.

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,380
In order to stay tractable, we assume

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,940
that the firm's leverage ratio remains constant over time.

36
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,880
This is a strong assumption, but not

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,260
too far off as a first-order approximation from reality,

38
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,010
as we have seen from the data in Lecture 17.

39
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,340
Constant leverage ratio means that the following two ratios,

40
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,270
that is DT over VLT equals WD, which is the Weight of Debt,

41
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,890
in the total value of the firm.

42
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,590
And ET over VLT, which is WE, that's

43
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,280
the relative Weight of Equity, in a total value of the firm.

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,950
These two ratios would stay constant.

45
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,460
This then implies that the required rate of return

46
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:55,800
on the levered firm is given by rL equals DT over VLT times rD

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,030
plus ET over VLT times rE, that is

48
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,990
the weighted average of return on debt and equity,

49
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,120
or written slightly differently, debt

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,570
equals wD times rD plus wE times rE.

51
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:19,750
Next we have 1 plus rL times VLT equals

52
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:26,500
1 minus tau times Xt plus 1 plus tau times rD times Dt

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,970
and plus VLt plus 1.

54
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,640


55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,890
We can also rewrite this as 1 minus tau times Xt plus 1

56
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:45,470
plus tau times rD times Dt over VLT times VLT plus VLT plus 1.

57
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,010
Here the left hand side is the gross payoff

58
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,400
from the levered firm and the right hand side

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,800
is it's three pieces, after tax cash flow, tax credit,

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,780
and the resale value.

61
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:08,820
We can further rewrite the above as 1 plus rL minus wD times

62
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,920
tau times rD then times VLT equals 1 minus tau times Xt

63
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,750
plus 1 plus VLT plus 1.

64
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,600
From this equation, which is rewritten

65
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
as the first equation on top of the slide,

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,040
we can define WACC as rL minus wD tau times

67
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:41,640
rD equals wD times rD plus wE times rE minus wD times tau

68
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,790
times rD, which also equals wD times 1 minus tau times

69
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,270
rD plus wE times rE.

70
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,280
We can then rewrite the first equation on this slide as--

71
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,360
left hand side--

72
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,266
1 plus WACC times VLT equals 1 minus tau times Xt

73
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:11,550
plus 1 plus VLT plus 1 or VLT equals

74
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:21,080
1 minus tau times Xt plus VLT plus 1 divided by 1 plus WACC.

75
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,700
We're writing this out.

76
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,270
We have sum from s equal to 1 to infinity

77
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:32,420
1 minus tau times Xt plus s divided by 1 plus WACC

78
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,714
to the power of s.

79
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:39,810
Therefore, Including the tax benefit from leverage,

80
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,390
still ignoring the cost of default

81
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,600
and assuming a constant leverage ratio,

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,360
we can value a firm or a project in two equivalent ways.

83
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,060
The first is to compute its NPV adjusted for the tax benefit

84
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,550
of debt, that is the APV.

85
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,090
It is given by the first equation on the slide.

86
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:09,290
VL equals D plus E equals VU plus PVTS.

87
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,130
Writing out, that gives us sum from s equal to 1

88
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:20,130
to infinity 1 minus tau times Xs divided by 1 plus rA

89
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:26,640
to the power of s plus PVTS and that is the APV.

90
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,150
The second method is to compute its value

91
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,540
by discounting its after tax cash flow using

92
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,320
WACC adjusted for tax shield.

93
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,830
It leads to the second valuation equation on the slide.

94
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,400
VL equals the sum from s equal to 1

95
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,960
to infinity 1 minus tau times Xs divided

96
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,370
by 1 plus WACC raised to the power of s,

97
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,730
where the WACC is adjusted for tax shield

98
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,270
given by the last equation on the slide, that is WACC equals

99
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,570
wD times 1 minus tau rD plus wE times rE,

100
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,140
which can also be written as D over D

101
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,750
plus E times 1 minus tau times rD plus D over D plus E

102
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,210
times rE.

103
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,240
Both methods, if implemented properly,

104
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,030
will give the right answer.

105
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,400
We will return to their pros and cons

106
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,850
at the end of this lecture.
