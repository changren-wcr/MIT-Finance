PROFESSOR: In this video, we will demonstrate

1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,760
how to value a leveraged firm by using the adjusted

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,160
present value approach in a situation

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,510
when the firm maintains a constant leverage ratio.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,150
Consider a firm that generates $10 million

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,340
in earnings before interest and taxes each year in perpetuity.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,510
The required return on assets of this firm is 10%.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,300
Suppose that the firm's financing policy is such

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,000
that it constantly maintains debt at 25% of its asset value.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,150
At this level, the debt is risk free.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,840
Assume that the corporate income tax rate is 25%

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,930
and that the risk-free rate is 2%.

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,200
What is the value of this firm?

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,330
To find the value of this firm, we

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,320
will apply the adjusted present value method.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,940
The levered firm value equals to the unleveraged firm

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,470
value plus the present value of interest tax shields.

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,510
Since the firm generates perpetual earnings

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,840
of $10 million, the value of the unlevered firm

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,970
is the present value of perpetuity

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,130
with after-tax earnings generated

21
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,900
every year discounted to present at the asset cost of capital.

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,080
Given the tax rate of 25% and the asset cost

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,350
of capital of 10%, we find that the unlevered firm

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,484
value is $75 million.

25
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,440
Since the firm constantly adjusts debt amount

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,860
so that leverage ratio stays constant,

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,800
future debt amount and hence tax shield

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,610
is as uncertain as cash flows of the firm.

29
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,120
This means that to find the present value of tax shields,

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,930
we discount them at the asset cost of capital.

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,590
Since the firm keeps debt at 25% of its asset value

32
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,510
and the current asset value is $75 million,

33
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,920
it implies that the current value of debt

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,130
must be $18.75 million.

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,260
Note that the value of assets and the value

36
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,798
of the unlevered firm are the same.

37
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:04,260
Recall that the debt is risk free.

38
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,850
Hence the interest on debt is rf times D,

39
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:13,975
and the tax shield is tax rate times rf times D. These tax

40
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,940
shields will continue into perpetuity,

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,790
and hence their present value is the value

42
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,798
of annual tax shield divided by the asset cost of capital.

43
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:24,340
Recall that the asset cost of capital

44
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,430
is the appropriate discount rate for these tax shields given

45
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,090
that the firm maintains constant leverage ratio.

46
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,530
Plugging in the numbers, we get 25% times 2%

47
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,840
times $18.75 million divided by 10%.

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,060
This gives us the present value of tax shields

49
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,992
of $0.94 million.

50
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:50,440
Adding the value of the unlevered firm

51
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,630
and the value of interest tax shields,

52
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,840
we find that the value of this firm equals to $75.94 million.

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,810
Note that the interest tax shields account only

54
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,540
for 1.2% of this firm's total value.

55
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,500
This is because the leverage ratio is fairly low,

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,990
the interest rate on this debt is low,

57
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,960
and the risk of these tax shields is high.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,650
The combination of these factors results in low present value

59
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,500
of tax shields.

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,000
