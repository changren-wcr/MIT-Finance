00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,490
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will demonstrate

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,850
how to value a leveraged firm by using its weighted average cost

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,380
of capital.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,540
You're a consultant who was hired

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,380
to evaluate the new product line for Kendall Enterprises.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,260
The upfront investment required to launch the product line

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,010
is $10 million.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,770
The product will generate free cash flow of $750,000

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,840
the first year, and this free cash flow

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,320
is expected to grow at a rate of 4% per year.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,300
Kendall has an equity cost of capital of 11.3%,

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,280
a debt cost of capital of 5%, and a tax rate of 35%.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,720
Kendall maintains a debt to equity ratio of 0.4.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,870
What is the NPV of the new product line, including

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,900
any tax shields from leverage?

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,810
How much debt will Kendall initially take on

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,240
as a result of launching this product line?

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,790
How much of the product line's value

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,370
is attributable to the present value of interest tax shields?

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,920
Let's start with the first question.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,970
NPV of the new product line is the present value of cash flows

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,480
it will generate minus the investment cost.

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,760
We know that the investment cost is $100 million.

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,170
Therefore, in order to find the NPV,

25
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,020
we need to find the present value of cash flows.

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,700
The cash flows that the new product

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,320
line generates are expected to grow

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,990
at a 4% rate in perpetuity.

29
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,720
Therefore, we can find the present value of these cash

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,050
flows by using the present value of growing perpetuity formula.

31
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,990
Recall that next year's cash flow from the New line

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,680
equals $750,000.

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,410
Importantly, note that we're discounting these cash

34
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,150
flows at WACC.

35
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,330
Using WACC as a discount rate allows us to directly

36
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,580
incorporate the value of interest tax shields

37
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,800
into the value of the project.

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,630
Let's find WACC.

39
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,840
By definition, WACC equals to the cost

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,710
of equity capital multiplied by equity to value ratio

41
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,200
plus aftertax cost of debt capital

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,930
multiplied by debt to value ratio.

43
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,330
In our case, cost of equity is 11.3%, cost of debt is 5%,

44
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,330
and the tax rate is 35%.

45
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,250
Since the firm maintains constant debt

46
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,770
to equity ratio of 0.4, this means

47
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,970
that equity to value ratio equals to 1 over 1.4

48
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,190
and debt to value ratio equals to 0.4 over 1.4.

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,310
We see that the weighted average cost of capital for this firm

50
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,170
equals 9%.

51
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,200
Knowing WACC, we can compute the present value of cash flows

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,070
from the new product line.

53
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:44,310
It equals to $750,000 divided by 9% minus 4%, which

54
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,990
equals to $15 million.

55
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,840
Knowing the present value of cash flows

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,560
from the new product line, we can find its NPV.

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,810
We see that the net present value of this product line

58
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,156
is $5 million.

59
00:02:57,156 --> 00:03:00,180
Next, let's find out how much debt Kendall will initially

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,210
need to take on as a result of launching this new product

61
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,650
line.

62
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,370
The new line adds $15 million in assets

63
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,240
to the left-hand side of the market value balance sheet.

64
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,700
Recall that Kendall maintains debt-to-equity ratio

65
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,820
of 0.4, which means that debt accounts

66
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,260
for 28.57% of its value.

67
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,040
In order to maintain the debt-to-value ratio at 28.57%,

68
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,730
Kendall needs to take new debt in the amount

69
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:36,810
of 28.57% times $50 million, which equals to $4.29 million.

70
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,720
The remaining $10.71 million needs

71
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,090
to be financed with equity.

72
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,690
Finally, let's find how much of the product line's value

73
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,870
is attributable to the present value of interest tax shields.

74
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,300
In order to answer this question, we need to find

75
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,850
what would the present value of cash flows from the project

76
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,260
have been if it was 100% equity financed?

77
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,110
In order to do that, we need to discount the cash flows

78
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,640
at the asset cost of capital.

79
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,310
Let's find out what it is.

80
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,380
The asset cost of capital, also known

81
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,210
as the unlevered cost of capital,

82
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,270
equals to the equity cost of capital times equity

83
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,810
to value ratio plus debt cost of capital times debt

84
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,519
to value ratio.

85
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,490
Plugging in the numbers, we find that the asset cost of capital

86
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,630
in our case equals to 9.5%.

87
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,700
Knowing the asset cost of capital,

88
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,160
we can compute the present value of cash flows

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,390
from this new line if it was 100% equity financed.

90
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,365
It equals to $13.64 million.

91
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:39,720
The value of the new line attributable

92
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,380
to the present value of tax shields equals to $15 million

93
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:50,470
minus $13.64 million, which gives us $1.36 million.

94
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,530
There is also an alternative way of finding the present value

95
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,670
of interest tax shields.

96
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,210
Since the initial value of debt is $4.29 million,

97
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,220
the tax shield in the first year is $4.29 million times 5%,

98
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,090
which is the cost of debt, times 35%, which is the tax rate.

99
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,750
This gives us $0.075 million.

100
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,800
Since the firm maintains constant leverage ratio,

101
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,820
the risk of tax shields is the same as the risk of cash flows.

102
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,860
Therefore, we're discounting them

103
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,390
at the asset cost of capital.

104
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,600
Also, since debt to value ratio is fixed

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,350
and since the value of the firm grows at 4% in perpetuity,

106
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,790
the value of tax shields also grows at 4% in perpetuity.

107
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,170
Applying the growing perpetuity formula,

108
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,320
we find that the present value of tax shields

109
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,370
equals to $1.36 million.

110
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,000
