00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,400
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will illustrate

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,420
based on a simple example that valuation approaches based

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,730
on adjusted present value, and based

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,570
on weighted average cost of capital yield the same results.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,410
Consider a firm that is expected to generate $100 million

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,480
in earnings before interest and taxes in year one.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,170
These earnings are expected to grow

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,870
at a 2% rate in perpetuity.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,760
Suppose that assets of this firm have a market beta of 1.35.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,759
The firm has a $500 million loan which

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,610
carries an interest rate of 5%.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,970
Each year the firm is planning to increase loan amount

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,345
proportionally with its earnings to maintain a constant debt

14
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:45,180
to equity ratio in perpetuity.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,480
Assume that the cost of debt will remain at 5%,

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,550
assume that the risk free rate is 3%,

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,630
and the expected return on the market portfolio is 10%.

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,860
Corporate income tax rate is 25%.

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,080
We will answer the following questions:

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,690
what would be the value of this firm

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,260
if it was 100% equity financed?

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,620
What is the present value of interest tax shields?

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,780
What is the value of this firm?

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,250
What is the weighted average cost of capital for this firm?

25
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,020
Find the value of this firm using the WACC

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,145
and compare it to part (c).

27
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:22,830


28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,500
Let's start with the first question.

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,860
The unlevered firm value is the after tax earnings divided

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,730
by the asset cost of capital, minus growth rate, g.

31
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,400
The tax rate is 25%, earnings next year are 100 million

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,640
and the perpetual growth rate is 2%.

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,390
The only unknown is the asset cost of capital.

34
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,270
We're given asset beta, and hence, we

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,890
can apply the capital asset pricing

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,710
model to find the asset cost of capital.

37
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,730
Given the beta, the risk free rate, and the expected return

38
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,390
in the market portfolio, we find that the asset cost of capital

39
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,130
is 12.45%.

40
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:09,639
This gives us the unlevered firm value of $717.70 million.

41
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,830
Next, let's find the present value of interest tax shields.

42
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,800
Since the firm value grows at a 2% rate,

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,050
the debt value has to grow at a 2% rate

44
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,200
as well in order for the firm to maintain constant leverage

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,700
ratio.

46
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,740
Interest tax shield in year one equals

47
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,070
to the tax rate, which is 25%, times the interest expense,

48
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,000
which is 5% times $500 million.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,380
This gives us $6.25 million.

50
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,350
Since the firm maintains constant leverage ratio,

51
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,390
the risk of interest tax shields is the same

52
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,370
as the risk of firm's assets.

53
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,650
Therefore, to find their present value,

54
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,490
we're discounting them at the asset cost of capital.

55
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,550
Since tax shields grow at a 2% rate in perpetuity,

56
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,490
their present value can be found by applying growing perpetuity

57
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,910
formula.

58
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,790
We find that the present value of tax shields

59
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,530
equals to $59.81 million.

60
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,930
To find the value of the firm, we

61
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,330
are adding the present value of interest tax shields

62
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,880
to the unlevered firm value.

63
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,400
We see that the firm value equals to $777.51 million.

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,680
Next, let's find the weighted average cost of capital.

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,940
By definition, the WACC equals to the cost of equity capital,

66
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,490
multiplied by the equity to value ratio,

67
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,100
plus the after tax cost of debt capital multiplied by debt

68
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,970
to value ratio.

69
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,460
We know all of the ingredients in this equation

70
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,550
except for the cost of equity, therefore, let's find it first.

71
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,750
To find the equity cost of capital,

72
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,890
we will use Modigliani-Miller proposition II.

73
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,540
Recall the equity cost of capital

74
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,550
equals to the asset cost of capital,

75
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,370
plus debt to equity ratio, multiplied

76
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,750
by the difference in the asset and debt cost of capital.

77
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,000
To find debt to equity ratio, recall

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,330
that debt value is $500 million, and the value

79
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,100
of the levered firm is $777.51 million,

80
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:20,490
which implies that the value of equity is $277.51 million.

81
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,850
Putting everything together, we find that the cost of equity

82
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,646
is 25.87%.

83
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:29,520
Notice that due to very high leverage equity

84
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,690
is more than twice as risky as assets of the firm.

85
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,640
Knowing the cost of equity, we can

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,550
find the weighted average cost of capital.

87
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,330
We see that it equals to 11.65%.

88
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,560
Recall that the asset cost of capital equals to 12.45%.

89
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,500
The WACC is lower than the asset cost of capital

90
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,080
due to the tax benefits of debt.

91
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,230
Finally, we can compute the firm value using the WACC

92
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,450
that we just computed.

93
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,360
Levered firm value equals to the after tax earnings,

94
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,730
divided by the weighted average cost of capital,

95
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,950
minus growth rate, g.

96
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,780
The tax rate is 25%, earnings next year are $100 million,

97
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,080
and the perpetual growth rate is 2%.

98
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,290
Given the WACC of 11.65%, we find

99
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:22,170
that the levered firm value equals to the $777.51 million.

100
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,340
This is exactly the same value that we

101
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,950
found by applying the adjusted present value

102
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,180
method in the beginning of this question.
