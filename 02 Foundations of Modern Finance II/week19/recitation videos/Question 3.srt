00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,070
PROFESSOR: There is a publicly traded firm, ABC.

1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,400
It has 12 million shares outstanding,

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,780
and its shares are traded at $25 apiece.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,910
We will assume that this company as of now

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:20,260
is all equity financed and has no debt on its balance sheet.

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,640
This company is considering a share repurchase program.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,330
It plans to borrow, take a loan from a bank of $100 million,

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,259
and use these funds to repurchase

8
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,500
some of these existing shares.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,422
We will assume that the tax rate is 21%,

10
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:41,630
and we'll try to understand how this transaction, how

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,700
the share repurchase, affects the current shareholders

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,870
of this firm.

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,170
The first question asks us, what is the current market

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,430
value of this firm?

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,855
Well, since this firm has no debt on its balance sheet,

16
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:59,000
so it's all equity financed, the market value of the firm

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,280
will equal to the value of equity of this firm, which

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,330
can simply be computed as share price, $25 a share,

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,700
multiplied by the total number of shares outstanding,

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,650
which is 12 million.

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,910
So this gives us $300 million.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,030
So therefore, the market value of the firm and the market

23
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,300
value of equity would both equal to $300 million

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,850
prior to the announcement of the share repurchase program.

25
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,400
The second question asks, what is

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,130
the value of this firm after the loan is taken

27
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,920
but before the shares are purchased?

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,680
Well, let's construct the market value balance

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,980
sheet of this firm after this transaction.

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,790
So first of all, put the assets that we just

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,480
received in the form of cash from this loan.

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,600
So that's $100 million.

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,650
That's the first asset.

34
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,580
The second asset is the original assets that this firm had.

35
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,750
And so the market value of the assets of this firm

36
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,990
is $300 million that we found in part A.

37
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,810
So that's the second part - I call it

38
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,770
the original assets here.

39
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,405
And then the third part is this new asset,

40
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:13,280
which is the present value of the tax shields

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,600
that are generated by this loan, or more

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,540
specifically, by the interest payments on this loan.

43
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,300
Remember that the interest is a tax-deductible expense.

44
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,050
We do not pay taxes on that.

45
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,730
And therefore, this loan would generate this valuable tax

46
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,450
shield, and this is the present value of these tax shields.

47
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,320
How did we find this?

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,410
Remember that this is just the value

49
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,650
of this loan, $100 million, multiplied

50
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,890
by the tax rate of 21%.

51
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,730
And so this is $21 million.

52
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,180
Now, this calculation makes one important assumption.

53
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,170
It assumes that this loan, it's either

54
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,190
rolled over under the same conditions every year

55
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,010
into perpetuity, or it is just a directly perpetual loan

56
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,040
on which we're paying interest but we're never

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,090
repaying the interest.

58
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,540
So therefore, the present value of these tax shields

59
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,090
can be computed by just multiplying

60
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,610
the market value of this loan times the tax rate.

61
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,967
Now, therefore, we have these three assets on our market

62
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:28,800
value balance sheet.

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,220
So cash plus original assets plus the present value

64
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,270
of tax shields.

65
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,567
And this gives us $421 million.

66
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,150
So the answer is that the market value

67
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,430
of this firm after this loan is taken is $421 million.

68
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,100
Now, what is the market value of equity

69
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,350
of this firm after this loan is taken

70
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,650
but before shares are repurchased?

71
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,030
Well, let's continue with the market value balance sheet.

72
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,960
So we've figured out what happened on the asset

73
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,430
side of this balance sheet.

74
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,710
What happens on the liabilities side of this balance sheet?

75
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,780
Well, now we have debt with the market value of $100 million

76
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,550
that we have just taken.

77
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,590
And the remaining part is equity.

78
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,230
And equity here would be applied, because we know

79
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,150
the market value of assets.

80
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,279
And therefore, we know the market value of debt.

81
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,800
And we can compute the market value of equity

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,019
as the difference between the market value of assets

83
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,430
and the market value of debt.

84
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,680
Again, this is just because the value

85
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,390
of assets and the value of liabilities

86
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,280
has to add up on the market value balance sheet.

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,660
So therefore, this is quite simply $321 million.

88
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,370
So the answer is that the market value

89
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,590
of equity of this term right now, again,

90
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,440
after this loan has been taken but before shares are

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,510
repurchased, is $321 million.

92
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,200
Now, what happens to the value of the firm

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,030
and the value of its equity after the shares

94
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,610
have been repurchased?

95
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,370
Let's start with the market value balance

96
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,060
sheet that we derived in the previous part of this question

97
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,820
after we've taken the loan but before we've actually

98
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,740
repurchased shares.

99
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,220
Now, when we purchase shares, what happens?

100
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,100
So first is that we are using this cash that we just

101
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,850
raised from this loan to repurchase shares.

102
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,140
So the cash becomes 0 right here.

103
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,850
The market value of assets does not

104
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,620
change as the result of the repurchase.

105
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,303
So it's $300 million here.

106
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:29,970
And the present value of the tax shield does not change as well.

107
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,120
So that remains at 21.

108
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,930
So therefore, the market value of assets of this firm

109
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,880
has to equal $321 million simply because we took this

110
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,200
$100 million, and we used this to repurchase shares back.

111
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,840
Now, what happens on the liability side of this balance

112
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,050
sheet?

113
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,750
Well, the market value of debt clearly does not change,

114
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,840
so it still stays at $100 million.

115
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,950
This is how much we borrowed.

116
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,350
And equity here is a plug.

117
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,130
So we can find it by taking the total value of the firm, which

118
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,130
right now is $321 million, subtracting debt,

119
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,300
and that gives us $221 million.

120
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,810
Again, because the market value of liabilities and the market

121
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,240
value of assets have to match, so therefore,

122
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,298
both sides of this balance sheet equal to $321 million.

123
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,590
So the answer here is that the market value of the firm

124
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,680
is $321, and the market value of equity is $221 million.

125
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,980
Now, what is the share price of this stock

126
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,980
after the recapitalization has been announced

127
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,340
after we received the loan, but before we've actually

128
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,640
repurchased shares?

129
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,420
Well, we found that in this case,

130
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,817
the market value of equity would be $321 million.

131
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:50,650
So therefore, we can compare the share price

132
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,330
as the total market value of equity

133
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,640
divided by the number of shares that we have outstanding.

134
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,930
So I abbreviated here this as SHO, Shares Outstanding.

135
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,820
And this will give us share price.

136
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,960
So it's $321 million divided by 12 million shares outstanding.

137
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,560
This gives us $26.75.

138
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,960
So after this has happened, the share price

139
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,490
increases from $25 to $26.75.

140
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,430
Now, how many shares we'll be able to repurchase

141
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,190
in this case?

142
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,710
Well, let's compute it.

143
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,140
Recall that we have-- we just borrowed $100 million,

144
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,460
and we intend to spend the entire $100 million in cash

145
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,180
right now to repurchase as many shares as we can.

146
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,890
Well, how many?

147
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,560
We just found that the share price, the current share price,

148
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,360
is $26.75.

149
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,840
So therefore, if we spend $100 million on this repurchase,

150
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,420
we'll be able to repurchase $100 million

151
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,860
divided by the share price.

152
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,400
This will give us 3.74 million shares.

153
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,750
So this is how many shares we'll be able to repurchase

154
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,060
by spending this cash.

155
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,270
Now, we had 12 million shares in the beginning.

156
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,010
We purchased this many shares.

157
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,460
We have $8.26 million shares remaining.

158
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,110
So now, we can just double check, compute,

159
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,840
what is the new, after this repurchase has been done,

160
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,770
what is the new total market value of equity of this firm?

161
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,280
To do that, all we need to do is to multiply the current share

162
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,060
price, $26.75, by the remaining number

163
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,600
of shares that we have outstanding,

164
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,220
which is 8.26 million.

165
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:45,920
And this will give us $221 million.

166
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,070
This will be the new value of market, market value of equity

167
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,790
of this firm.

168
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,100
And I know that this has to be $221 million

169
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,638
because we've found this before.

170
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:56,180
So this is just a double check so you

171
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,220
can take the share price multiplied

172
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,470
by the number of remaining shares,

173
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,720
and you will see that the market value of equity

174
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,190
is $221 million.

175
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,050
Again, it happens just because it was $321 million,

176
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,340
and we repurchased 100 million shares,

177
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,960
so this reduces our total value of equity by $100 million

178
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,810
and reduces the number of total shares

179
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,600
outstanding by $374 million, bringing it

180
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,320
from $12 to $8.26 million.

181
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,160
Finally, let us examine what happens right

182
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,600
after the announcement of this share repurchase program.

183
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,500
So what will happen is that the moment we

184
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,610
announce this repurchase program and before we even

185
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,540
get this loan of $100 million, the market

186
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,420
will understand the tax implications

187
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,850
of this recapitalization.

188
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,700
And the fact that we will generate or this loan

189
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,790
will generate valuable tax shields.

190
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,020
So therefore, in addition to the original assets,

191
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,080
the market will assess the new present value

192
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,400
of the tax shields that this loan will generate.

193
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,050
And we've already computed this before,

194
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,700
so we know it's going to be $21 million.

195
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,800
So therefore, the market will understand

196
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,970
that the total value of assets of this firm

197
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,841
and the total value of this firm will be $300 plus $21--

198
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:24,280
$321 million.

199
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,200
And the market value of equity will

200
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,090
have to match this new value of the firm.

201
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,600
So the moment the share repurchase program

202
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,630
is announced, the market value of equity of this firm

203
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,050
will go from $300 million to $321 million.

204
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,880
Per share, this will be $26.75.

205
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,810
And this is something that we computed before as well.

206
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,990
The share price is going to go from $25 to $26.75.

207
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,470
If you put this on the chart in terms of sort of timeline

208
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,670
when this happens--

209
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,600
so this is $25.

210
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,540
The moments we announced the repurchase, the share price

211
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,220
in an efficient market will jump from $25 to $26.75,

212
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,820
and at that point onwards, it will stay at $26.75

213
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,530
because we already computed.

214
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,450
So the moment we got the loan is going

215
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,830
to be the same share price.

216
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,100
We will repurchase at this exact share price,

217
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,080
and the repurchase itself will not

218
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,910
have any effect on the value of the firm.

219
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,250
So the pricing effect will happen at the point in time

220
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,960
when this program is announced.

221
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,720
And then it will stay constant throughout

222
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,930
the subsequent events, such as getting the loan

223
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,530
and using the cash that we will receive from the loan

224
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,340
to actually repurchase shares.

225
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,000
