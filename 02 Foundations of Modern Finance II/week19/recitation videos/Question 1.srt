PROFESSOR: In this video, we will demonstrate

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,000
how to value a leveraged firm with a loan that requires

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,370
constant interest payments.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,950
Consider a firm that generates $10 million

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,250
in earnings before interest and taxes each year,

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,550
in perpetuity with no risk.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,280
Suppose the firm takes a perpetual loan on which it

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,790
is required to pay $8 million interest each year

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,620
in perpetuity.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,190
Assume that the corporate income tax rate is 25%,

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,280
and the risk-free rate is 2%.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,680
What is the value of this firm?

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,780
To find the value of this firm, we

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,405
will apply the Adjusted Present Value Method.

15
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:42,780
The levered firm value equals to the unlevered firm

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,100
value plus the present value of interest actuals.

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,410
Since the firm generates safe perpetual earnings

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,400
of $10 million, the value of the unlevered firm

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,250
is the present value of the risk-free perpetuity

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,270
with after-tax earnings generated every year.

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,920
Given the tax rate of 25% and the risk-free rate of 2%,

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,820
we find that the unlevered firm value equals to $375 million.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,790
Next, let's find the present value of interest tax shields.

24
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,600
Since the firm generates $10 million in risk-free earnings,

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,820
it has enough funds to pay interest

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,430
each year with certainty.

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,190
This means that the debt is risk-free,

28
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,010
and that the tax shields generated by this debt

29
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,360
are risk-free as well.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,030
Annual tax shield equals to the tax rate,

31
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,540
which is 25%, times the annual interest

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,120
expense, which is $8 million.

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,400
The present value of this stream of tax shields

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,210
equals to the present value of the risk-free perpetuity.

35
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,370
Given the risk free rate of 2%, we

36
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:54,310
find that the present value of tax shields is $100 million.

37
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,710
Adding the value of the unlevered firm

38
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,810
to the value of interest tax shields,

39
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,680
we find that the value of this firm equals to $475 million.

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,800
Note that the interest tax shields

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,490
account for 21% of this firm's total value.

42
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,970
This is because annual interest expense is large,

43
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,000
and because these tax shields are safe,

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,500
which results in the high present value.

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,000
