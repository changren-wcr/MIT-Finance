00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,030
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,660
cover option price sensitivity as a function of the underlying

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,220
stock price.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,980
Suppose that all assumptions of the Black-Scholes-Merton model

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,750
hold.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,640
There is a stock, XYZ, with the current share price of $50.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,570
Suppose that it has annual volatility of 35%.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,510
The annualized continuously compounded risk-free rate

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,441
is 1.25%.

10
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:30,720
Consider a put option with the strike price of $55

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,230
and six months to maturity.

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,480
First, we will construct a replicating portfolio

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,550
for this put option.

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,620
Second, we will assume that the stock price decreases to $47.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,380
We will compute the change in the option price

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,520
and the change in the value of the replicating portfolio.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,430
And finally, we will assume that the stock price increases

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,480
to $53, and we will also compute the change in the option price,

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,940
as well as the change in the value

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,570
of the replicating portfolio.

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,150
Let us start by building a replicating portfolio

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,280
for this put option.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,280
First, recall that replicating portfolio

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,590
for the call option in the context

25
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,230
of the Black-Scholes-Merton model is as follows.

26
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,560
We are buying N of X shares of the stock,

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,470
and we are borrowing the following amount dollars

28
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,250
at the risk-free rate.

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,340
Now, what is the replicating portfolio for the put option?

30
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,070
First, recall that we can price the put option

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,590
by using the put call parity.

32
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,590
So let's plug the Black-Scholes-Merton formula

33
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,800
for the value of the call option into the put call parity

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,090
equation.

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,980
We get the following equation.

36
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,520
And after rearranging terms, we can express the price

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,170
of the put option as follows.

38
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,040
Recall that N is the cumulative distribution

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,190
function of the standard normal distribution, which

40
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,490
means that N of x is always less than 1,

41
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,510
which in turn means that the terms highlighted

42
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,800
on the slide in red in parentheses,

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,539
1 minus N of X and 1 minus N of X minus sigma

44
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,800
multiplied by square root of T are positive.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,520
Therefore, to replicate the put option, we need to short 1

46
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,550
minus N of X shares of the stock,

47
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,190
and we need to invest the following amount of dollars

48
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,900
at the risk-free rate.

49
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,620
Let's construct replicating portfolio for our option.

50
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,080
Recall that we already priced it in the previous video,

51
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,490
and its price was $7.81.

52
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,770
To replicate this option, we need

53
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,460
to short the following amount of the underlying stock,

54
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,500
and we need to invest $37.48 at the risk-free rate.

55
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,190
I computed both of these values based on the option parameters

56
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,140
that are given to us.

57
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,530
By construction, the value of this replicating portfolio

58
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,710
matches the value of the option.

59
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,110
Let's see what happens to the value of the option

60
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,720
and the value of the replicating portfolio

61
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,420
when we change the stock price.

62
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,850
I have copied the original price of the put option

63
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,360
here, so that it doesn't change when I change the stock price.

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,850
And I created a new field here for the new price

65
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,860
which will change when I change the stock price.

66
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,270
So when the stock price drops from $50 to $47,

67
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,680
the original price, of course, stays the same.

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,780
The new price increases to $9.73.

69
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,310
Therefore, the price change is $1.92,

70
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,650
which is the difference between the new price

71
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,080
and the original price.

72
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,290
Now, let's see what happens to the value

73
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,450
of the replicating portfolio.

74
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,200
So first, notice that I changed these two cells

75
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,370
into the values and not the formula,

76
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,880
so that the replicating portfolio that we constructed

77
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,590
before does not change when I change the share price.

78
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,870
But the value of the portfolio will

79
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,090
change, because it depends on these parameters

80
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,020
of the portfolio, but it will take into account the new share

81
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,660
price.

82
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,920
So when the share price drops to $47,

83
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,440
the value of the replicating portfolio increases to $9.59

84
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,290
from the original value of $7.81.

85
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,110
So therefore, the value of the portfolio

86
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,700
increases by $1.78, which, again, is just

87
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,190
the difference between the new value of the portfolio

88
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,860
minus the original value.

89
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,920
We can make one important conclusion so far.

90
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,890
When the share price drops from $50 to $47,

91
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,590
the value of the put option increases more than the value

92
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:45,420
of the replicating portfolio, so $1.92 versus $1.78.

93
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,070
Let's see what happens when the share price increases to $53.

94
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,830
In this case, the option price decreases by $1.64,

95
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,440
and the value of the replicating portfolio decreases by $1.78.

96
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,200
Let's summarize our results.

97
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,730
They're highlighted here in yellow.

98
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,820
We see that the value of the replicating portfolio

99
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,940
does not increase as much as the option value

100
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,490
when the stock price declines.

101
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,700
On the other hand, the value of replicating portfolio

102
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,820
decreases more than the value of the option

103
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,440
when the stock price increases.

104
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,500
The reason behind this result is that the value

105
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,110
of the put option, as shown on this graph,

106
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,090
is a convex function of the stock price.

107
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,570
In other words, it has a positive gamma,

108
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,940
similar to the call option, which we illustrated

109
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,830
in the previous video.

110
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,070
On the other hand, the value of our replicating portfolio

111
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,220
is a simple linear function of the underlying stock price.

112
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,060
Therefore, when the stock price increases,

113
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,240
the value of replicating portfolio overshoots.

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,340
And when the stock price decreases, it undershoots.
