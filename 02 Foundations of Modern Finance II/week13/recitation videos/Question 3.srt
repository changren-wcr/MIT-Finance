00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,570
PROFESSOR: In this video we will learn

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,250
how to use state prices to price options.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,010
We will work with the same European lookback option

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,770
that we covered in the previous videos.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,190
This option allows you to buy a stock two years from now

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,560
for the lowest price of the stock during the coming two

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,060
years.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,450
We will assume that the stock price follows the same price

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,950
pattern.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,050
The stock does not pay dividends.

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,260
We will assume that the risk-free rate is 5%, quoted

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,880
as an effective annual rate.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,010
And we will also assume that there is no arbitrage

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,870
and that investors can borrow and lend

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,490
at this risk-free rate.

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,580
First, let's compute state prices.

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,890
The price of the up state in year one

18
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,260
equals to the risk-neutral probability

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,460
of the up state, qu divided by 1 plus r, where r

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,590
is the risk-free interest rate.

21
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,870
The price of the down state in year one

22
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,410
equals to the risk-neutral probability of the down state,

23
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,470
qd divided by 1 plus r.

24
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,590
Similarly, the price of uu state in year two

25
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,010
equals to the risk-neutral probability

26
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,980
of moving up squared divided by 1 plus r squared.

27
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,770
The state prices of states ud and du

28
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,080
would be the same in year two and they would

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,603
equal to qu multiplied by qd.

30
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,270
These are the risk-neutral probabilities

31
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,480
of up and down moves respectively,

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,030
divided by 1 plus r squared.

33
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,510
And finally, the state price of dd state

34
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:38,000
is qd squared divided by 1 plus r squared.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,580
On this graph we summarize state prices in this economy.

36
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,320
Now that we know state prices, we

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,700
can price any security in this economy,

38
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,090
including our lookback option.

39
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,720
Let's first price this option in year one in the up state.

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,980
Its price equals phi u, which is the one year price of the up

41
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,190
state multiplied by the option payoff

42
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,000
in the up up state, plus phi d, which is the one year

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,240
price of the down state multiplied by the option

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,270
payoff in the up down state.

45
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,060
Note that we're using state prices one year ahead

46
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,190
because this option pays off in year two

47
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,520
and we're pricing it in year one.

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,070
Similarly, we can price this option in year one

49
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,830
in the down state.

50
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,600
Note that prices of this option in year

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,060
one in the up and down state, $29.76 and $10.58,

52
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,010
match exactly what we had when we

53
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,930
were pricing this option using risk-neutral pricing approach.

54
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,480
Finally, to find the current price

55
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,000
of this option we are using year zero

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,260
state prices of all four possible states in year two.

57
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,700
So the option price equals phi uu multiplied by the option

58
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:58,290
payoff in the up up state, which is $56.25, plus phi

59
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,830
ud multiplied by the payoff from the option in the up

60
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,920
down state, which is 0, plus phi du multiplied by the option

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,390
payoff in the down up state, which

62
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,250
is $20, plus phi dd multiplied by the option payoff

63
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,190
in the down down state, which is 0.

64
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,320
We see that the current price of this option

65
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,980
is equal $20.23, which again matches

66
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,540
what we had when we priced this option using

67
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,230
risk-neutral pricing approach.

68
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,590
Finally, for illustrative purposes,

69
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,920
we can also price the stock using state prices.

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,580
Conceptually, we have used future expected stock prices

71
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,470
to compute state prices.

72
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,970
Therefore, if we didn't make a mistake,

73
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,820
we should get that the current stock price is equal to $100.

74
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,130
I will use stock prices in year two

75
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,630
and year zero state prices of all four states in year two

76
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,030
to compute the current stock price.

77
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,100
We see that the price of the stock is indeed $100.

78
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,430
This again illustrates that once we know state prices,

79
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,440
we can easily price any financial instrument.
