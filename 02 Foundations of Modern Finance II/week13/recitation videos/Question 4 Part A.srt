00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,070
PROFESSOR: In this video we will learn

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,043
how to use Black-Scholes-Merton formula to price options.

3
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:07,710
We will assume that all assumptions that

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,640
underlie Black-Scholes-Merton formula hold.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,530
Suppose that there is a stock, XYZ,

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,600
with the current price of $50.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,120
We will assume that it has annual volatility of 35%.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,890
The annualized continuously-compounded

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,060
risk-free rate is 1.25%.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,890
The first question asks, what is the price

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,160
of the call option with a strike price of $55

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,240
and six months to maturity?

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,460
The second question asks us to price the put option

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,180
of the same strike price, $55, and same time

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,590
to maturity, six months.

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,570
The Black-Scholes-Merton pricing formula

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,910
for a European call option is given

18
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,650
by the following expression.

19
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,620
Here S naught is the current share price,

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,170
N is the cumulative distribution function

21
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,280
of a standard normal distribution.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,730
K is the strike price of the option,

23
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,989
R is the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate.

24
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,220
Sigma is the annualized volatility of the stock price,

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,110
and T is time to maturity expressed in years.

26
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,590
Recall that in our case option has six months to maturity,

27
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,490
therefore capital T is 0.5.

28
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,490
Let's use Excel to implement the pricing of this option.

29
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,650
Here I have put all of the inputs

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,800
into the problem, the current share price, volatility,

31
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,260
risk-free interest rate, strike price, and maturity.

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,800
Let's start by computing X. Recall that X is given

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,480
by the following expression.

34
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,670
Therefore, to compute X, we need to carefully input

35
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,830
all of the option parameters into the corresponding formula,

36
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,140
which I have done here.

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,950


38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,875
Next, I will compute N of X. Recall

39
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,110
that N is the cumulative distribution

40
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,350
function of a standard normal distribution.

41
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,780
Excel has a corresponding function,

42
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,680
which is called NORM.S.DIST.

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,150
And it has two input parameters.

44
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:14,720
First is X and second can take values either 1 or 0.

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,510
1 is for the cumulative distribution function,

46
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,852
and 0 is the probability density function.

47
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:22,310
So we need the first one, so therefore the second parameter

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,540
is 1.

49
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,430
And that gives me N of X.

50
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,650
Next, I will compute the second expression, which

51
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,430
is N of X minus sigma multiplied by the square root

52
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:42,910
of capital T. So NORM.S.DIST, X minus sigma

53
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,173
multiplied by the square root of capital T. Recall

54
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:49,090
that we want cumulative distribution function,

55
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,480
therefore our second parameter is 1.

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,580
Now we can compute the option price.

57
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,130
According to the Black-Scholes-Merton formula

58
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,920
it equals the current share price

59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,570
multiplied by N of X minus the present value of the strike

60
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,110
price.

61
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,350
Recall that the strike price is $55.

62
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,610
We're finding the present value of this strike price

63
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,560
by multiplying it by the exponent raised

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,120
to the power negative risk-free rate multiplied by capital T.

65
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,340
And then we're multiplying it by N

66
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,040
of X minus sigma multiplied by square root of T,

67
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,810
which is this expression.

68
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,550
The price of this European call option

69
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,920
according to the Black-Scholes-Merton formula

70
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,880
is $3.15.

71
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,980
We can extend our analysis and use

72
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,080
the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to see

73
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,290
how the option price changes with respect to underlying

74
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,890
parameters.

75
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,400
Let's see how the option price changes with respect

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,800
to the stock price.

77
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,380
Recall that our original stock price was $50.

78
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:58,460
Here I have created an array from $20 to $100 in $0.50

79
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,390
increments.

80
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,000
And what I will do is that for each of these stock prices,

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,620
I will compute the option price according to the Black-Scholes

82
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,740
formula.

83
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,120
Now we can plot option price as a function of stock price.

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,910
We can confirm that the option price

85
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,779
increases with stock price.

86
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,570
The slope of this line, which is the delta of this option,

87
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,970
starts at 0 and gets closer to 1 as stock price rises.

88
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,420
You can also see that this function is convex, which

89
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,980
means that the gamma of the call option,

90
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,530
defined as the second derivative of the option price

91
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,040
with respect to the stock price, is positive.

92
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,110
You can try building similar plots for time

93
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,900
to maturity and volatility, which

94
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,470
will help you to visualize theta and vega of the call option.
