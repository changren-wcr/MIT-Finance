00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,770
PROFESSOR: In this video, I will show

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,950
an example of risk-neutral pricing approach applied

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,200
to exotic options.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,780
Suppose that there is a stock with a current price of $100.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,780
The graph below shows the evolution of the share

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,790
price over the next two years.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,680
In year 1, the share price can grow

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,350
to $125, after which it can grow to $156.25

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,620
or can go down back to $100.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,870
Alternatively, in year 1, the stock price

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,890
can go down to $80, after which it can grow to $100

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,890
or go down to $64.

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,370
We will assume that the stock does not pay dividends.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,173
The risk-free rate, quoted as an effective annual rate, is 5%.

15
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:45,090
We will also assume that there is no arbitrage

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,980
and that investors can borrow and lend

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,870
at this risk-free rate.

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,870
Consider an exotic option called a European lookback

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,010
option, which allows you to buy a stock two years from now

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,690
for the lowest price of the stock

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,120
during the coming two years.

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,340
Effectively, this option allows you

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,880
to time the market perfectly and get the stock at the best

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,110
price.

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,810
In a controversial practice, many firms

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,660
used to grant the executive officers lookback options.

27
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,380
This is an example of an article from the Wall Street Journal

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,790
that discusses this practice.

29
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,810
We will price this European lookback option

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,570
by using the risk-neutral pricing approach.

31
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,300
Let us start by creating a tree with the option

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,520
payoffs in different states.

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,490
Recall that in the up-up state, the share price is $156.25.

34
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,480
The lookback option allows you to buy this share at the lowest

35
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,090
price during the last two years, which was $100 in year 0.

36
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,640
Therefore, your payoff from this lookback option is $56.25.

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,270
In the up-down state, denoted here as ud,

38
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,860
the share price is $100.

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,240
And therefore, the payoff from the lookback option is $0.

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,500
In the down-up node, the option payoff is $20.

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,620
Recall that the share price in this node is $100.

42
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,190
But the share price in the down node in year 1 was $80.

43
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,200
And therefore, this option allows

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,050
you to buy a share of the stock for $80.

45
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,870
Hence, your payoff is $20.

46
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,560
Finally, in the down-down node, the share price is $64.

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,500
The option allows you to buy the share at $64.

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,300
Your payoff is $0.

49
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,960
Notice that the value of this option is path-dependent.

50
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,400
Even though in nodes ud and du the share price is $100,

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,000
the payoff and the value of the option in the node ud is $0.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,920
But in the node du, it is $20.

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,580
This is the summary of the optimal exercise.

54
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,560
In nodes uu and du, the lookback option gets exercised.

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,790
And in the nodes ud and dd, the lookback option

56
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,500
does not get exercised.

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,410
Now that we know option payoffs, the next step

58
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,540
is to find risk-neutral probabilities

59
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,490
of the up and down moves.

60
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,710
First, let's find multiples u and d

61
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,610
by which the price either goes up or down each year.

62
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,400
The multiple u will be 1.25, which

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,870
is the share price in year 1, $125, divided by $100.

64
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,460
And the down multiple, d, would be 0.8.

65
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,570
Again, we get it by dividing sd by S0.

66
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,210
We can verify that stock prices in year 2

67
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,570
are consistent with these multiples u and d.

68
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,150


69
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,170
By definition, the risk-neutral probability of the up move

70
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,100
will be 1 plus r, which is the risk-free rate, minus d divided

71
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,780
by u minus d, which gives us 0.556.

72
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,900
Similarly, the risk-neutral probability of the down move

73
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:55,440
is u minus 1 plus r divided by u minus d, which gives us 0.44.

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,850
Notice that by definition, risk-neutral probabilities

75
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,030
of the up and down moves add up to 1.

76
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,710
Knowing risk-neutral probabilities,

77
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,000
we can proceed with pricing this option.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,980
I will start pricing it in year 1 in the up node.

79
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,170
Price equals the risk-neutral probability

80
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,640
of the up move multiplied by the option payoff in the state uu

81
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,220
plus the risk-neutral probability of the down move

82
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,240
multiplied by the option payoff in the state ud divided

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,940
by 1 plus risk-free rate r.

84
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,270
Plugging in the numbers, we get option price in the state

85
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,860
u in year 1 equal to $29.76.

86
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,340
We can repeat the process and find the option price in year 1

87
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,890
in the down state, which would equal to $10.58.

88
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,280
Finally, we can find the option price in year 0.

89
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,800
It was equal to qu multiplied by cu,

90
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,830
which is the price of the option in year 1 in the up

91
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,580
node, plus qd multiplied by cd, which is the option

92
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,330
price in year 1 in the down node, divided by 1

93
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,730
plus r, which is the risk-free rate.

94
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,940
Plugging in the numbers, we'll get $20.23.

95
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,410
Importantly, the risk-neutral pricing approach

96
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,920
allows us to price this option in year 0

97
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,040
directly from payoffs in year 2.

98
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,570
The price of the option in year 0

99
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,960
equals qu squared, which is the probability of getting

100
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,170
to state uu multiplied by the payoff

101
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,040
from the option in that state, plus the probability

102
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,690
of getting to state ud, which is qu times qd multiplied

103
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,270
by the corresponding option payoff,

104
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,700
plus the probability of getting to state

105
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,650
du, which is qd times qu multiplied, again,

106
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,470
by the payoff from the option in that state,

107
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,420
plus qd squared multiplied by the option payoff in the state

108
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,680
dd.

109
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280
The numerator in this expression is the expected payoff

110
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,610
from this option in year 2 under the risk-neutral probabilities

111
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,340
q.

112
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,760
To find the present value of this expected payoff,

113
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,790
we're discounting it to present at the risk-free rate, r.

114
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,400
Plugging in the numbers, we see that the price of this option

115
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,500
in year 0 is equal to $20.23.

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,000
