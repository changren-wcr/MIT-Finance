INSTRUCTOR: In this video, we will

1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,690
compute the price of the put option, which

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,640
has the same parameters as the option we

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,960
studied in the previous video.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,550
The strike price of this option is $55, and time to maturity

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,080
is six months.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,030
To compute the price of this put option,

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,550
we will use put-call parity.

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,620
Recall that the price of the call

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,920
option plus the present value of the strike K

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,950
should equal to the stock price plus the price

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,770
of the put option, to avoid arbitrage.

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,020
Let's apply this to our case.

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,759
The price of the put option will equal

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,530
the price of the call option, which

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,250
we computed in the previous video (it's $3.15),

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,500
plus the present value of the strike

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,600
price of this option, which is $55, minus the current share

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,700
price, which is $50.

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,790
This gives us the price of this option, which is $7.81.

20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,830
As a more general note, to compute

21
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,080
the price of a European put option using

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,850
the Black-Scholes-Merton approach,

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,610
we first need to compute the price of the corresponding call

24
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,190
option with the same strike and same time

25
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,610
to maturity by using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula,

26
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,580
and then use the put-call parity to get the price of the put.
