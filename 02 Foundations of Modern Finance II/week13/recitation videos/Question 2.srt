00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,330
PROFESSOR: In this video I will show you

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,760
how to construct replicating portfolios

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,220
from known option prices.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,770
Recall that last week we did the opposite.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,420
Namely, we priced options by using replicating portfolios.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,330
In practice however, pricing by replication

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,960
is impractical and often infeasible.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,910
But many practitioners often need

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,010
to construct replicating portfolios

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,680
for hedging or speculating reasons.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,140
And that's what we will cover now.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,210
We will work with the lookback option

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,692
that we covered in question one.

14
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:36,650
And we will construct the following replicating

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,520
portfolios: a portfolio at time 0, which

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,090
replicates the payoff from the option of time 1,

17
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,270
a portfolio at time 1 in the up node, which replicates

18
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,940
the payoff from this option at time 2,

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,880
and a portfolio at time 1 in the down node

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,225
that replicates the payoff from this option at time 2.

21
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,100
We will assume that the stock price evolution

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,680
is the same as in question one.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,960
Suppose that the replicating portfolio has

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,660
delta shares of the stock and b dollars

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,420
invested in the riskless bond.

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,230
Recall the following expressions for delta and b

27
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,330
and let's apply them to our case.

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,240
Let's start in year 0.

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,670
I will denote replicating portfolio in year 0

30
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,700
by delta naught and b naught.

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,860
Using numbers from question one, we

32
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,920
obtain the following values for delta and b.

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,710
This implies that to replicate these options payoff in

34
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:36,710
year one, we need to buy 0.4262 shares of the stock

35
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,270
and borrow 22.396 dollars at the risk-free rate.

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,230
Note that the price of this replicating portfolio

37
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,270
equals $20.23, which matches exactly the price of the option

38
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,490
that we found in question one.

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,780
Now, let's repeat the same steps and find replicating portfolio

40
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,300
in year one in the up node.

41
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,710
I will denote delta and b of this portfolio's delta 1u

42
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,660
and b1u.

43
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,009
One stands for year one, u stands for up node.

44
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,590
The delta would equal to 1 and the b

45
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,980
would equal to negative 95.238.

46
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,740
We can also verify that the price

47
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,950
of this replicating portfolio in year one in the up node

48
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,620
matches exactly the option price that we

49
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,960
found using risk neutral pricing approach

50
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,770
in the previous question.

51
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,650
Finally, we can find replicating portfolio

52
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,050
in year one in the down node.

53
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,440
Delta of this portfolio equals to 0.556

54
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,490
and b equals to negative 33.862.

55
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,710
We can also verify that the price

56
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,790
of this replicating portfolio in year one in the down node

57
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,720
matches the option price in this node found in question one.

58
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,290
This is a summary of replicating portfolios that we constructed.

59
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,140
First is the replicating portfolio in year zero.

60
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,790
Second is the replicating portfolio

61
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,900
in year one in the up node.

62
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,050
And third is the replicating portfolio

63
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,500
in year one in the down node.

64
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,000
