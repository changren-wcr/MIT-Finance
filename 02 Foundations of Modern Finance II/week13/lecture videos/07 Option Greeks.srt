1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,180
PROFESSOR: We now introduce what is known as the option Greeks.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,260
Option Greeks are measures of sensitivity of option prices

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,650
to small changes in various inputs.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,129
These have been traditionally denoted by Greek letters, hence

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,390
their name.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,750
We have encountered one commonly used option Greek already,

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,650
the delta.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,500
Options delta is the partial derivative

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,310
of the option price with respect to the underlying price.

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,130
It measures sensitivity of the option price

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,070
to small changes in the underlying price.

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,100
Related to delta is the omega, which

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,620
measures the elasticity of the option price

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,080
to the underlying price.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,140
Options omega can be seen as a measure of leverage

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,220
embedded in the option.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,970
Omega measures the percentage change in the option price

18
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,310
relative to the percentage change in the underlying price.

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,470
Another important measure is the options gamma.

20
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,080
Gamma is the second derivative of the options

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,040
price with respect to the underlying price.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,840
It measures convexity of the option price function.

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,840
The higher the gamma, the more the option holder

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,890
benefits from future volatility of the underlying price.

25
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,700
Also, because gamma is the derivative of the delta,

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,280
options with high gamma are in some sense harder

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,860
to replicate in practice, as the number

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,380
of shares in the replicating portfolio

29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,690
is more sensitive to the underlying price.

30
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,390


31
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,810
In addition to measuring option price sensitivity

32
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,330
to the underlying price, it is also

33
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,220
common to compute price sensitivity

34
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,890
to model parameters.

35
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,970
Theta measures how quickly the price of the option

36
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,170
changes with time to maturity.

37
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,390
While higher future return volatility

38
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,330
raises the value of call and put options,

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,170
their value tends to decline as options approach maturity.

40
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,199
Theta measures the speed of this decline.

41
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,290
The last Greek we want to highlight here is vega.

42
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,250
Vega is the sensitivity of the option price to stock return

43
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,120
volatility.

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
Stock return volatility is constant

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,110
under the Black-Scholes-Merton model,

46
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,670
yet it is useful to know how sensitive option prices are

47
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,700
to the volatility parameter because the assumption

48
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,270
of constant return volatility is only an approximation.

49
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,330
Options vega provides us with an indication

50
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,720
of how option prices may change as stock return

51
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,300
volatility rises or falls.

52
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,990
This is a shortcut.

53
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,110
A more comprehensive and internally consistent

54
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,660
analysis of this question would require

55
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,690
that we incorporate time-varying return volatility

56
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,230
into the option pricing model.

57
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,650
As an empirical illustration of the properties of options,

58
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,780
consider the behavior of several call

59
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,500
and put options on the S&P 500 index

60
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,630
during the first few days of August of 2011.

61
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,110
This has been a highly volatile period in the market

62
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,670
because of the unfolding US debt ceiling crisis.

63
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,060
According to the US Treasury, it was

64
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,000
going to run out of cash by mid-August

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,430
unless the US Congress agreed to raise the debt ceiling.

66
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,040
Following a tense debate in the Congress,

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,260
the debt ceiling was eventually raised

68
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,920
on the 31st of July, which enabled US government

69
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,750
to issue more debt.

70
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,950
On the 5th of August, Standard and Poor's credit rating agency

71
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,970
downgraded the long-term credit rating of the US government

72
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,640
from AAA to AA+ for the first time in history.

73
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,770
Because of the increased economic and political

74
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,680
uncertainty, the stock market fell sharply

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,030
during the first few days of August.

76
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,820
Prices of call options on the S&P 500

77
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,820
fell, and prices of put options rose.

78
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,600
For example, the call with a strike of $1,100

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,010
was in the money and traded at $184 on August 1.

80
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:29,790
Its price fell to $67.40 by August 10.

81
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,990
The call with the strike of $1,300 was out of the money

82
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,440
and traded at $25.80 on the 1st of August.

83
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,950
Its price fell to $1.20 by the 10th of August.

84
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,500
We observe that the out-of-the-money call

85
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,760
experienced a smaller dollar decline but a much larger

86
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,490
percentage decline than in-the-money call.

87
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,010


88
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,040
We observe a similar relation for the puts.

89
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,870
Prices of out-of-the-money puts rose more in percentage terms

90
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,190
than prices of the in-the-money puts.

91
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,770
This observation can be expressed as a statement

92
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,440
about the options Greeks.

93
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,990
Between the 1st and the 10th of August,

94
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:24,536
the value of the underlying fell by $156.20.

95
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:29,340
Relative to that, the value of the $1,100 strike call fell

96
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,830
by $116.60.

97
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,290
The ratio of these two numbers approximates

98
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,640
the delta of the option, 0.75.

99
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,910
This is less than the delta of the underlying asset itself,

100
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,590
which is 1.

101
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,880
This means that for $1 change of the underlying asset,

102
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,600
the price of the call option changes by less than $1.

103
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,290
In this case, for the $1,100 strike call,

104
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,540
it changes by $0.75.

105
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,260
For the $1,300 strike call, we approximate the delta

106
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,740
to be 0.16.

107
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,640
Prices of out-of-the-money calls are relatively less sensitive

108
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,970
to changes in the underlying price.

109
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,540
In contrast, the omega, which measures the elasticity

110
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,900
of the option price with respect to the underlying price,

111
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,480
meaning that it compares percentage changes,

112
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,930
is much higher for the $1,300 strike option.

113
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,160
It is 7.8.

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,310
This is compared to 5.2 for the $1,100 call.

115
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,150
The lesson here is that out-of-the-money options have

116
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,150
a high degree of embedded leverage relative

117
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,630
to the underlying asset, for which omega is equal to 1

118
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,700
by definition.

119
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,580
The figure on this slide illustrates the relation

120
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,230
between the option prices and the underlying price.

121
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,780
This is a scatterplot which shows

122
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,080
prices of two options, a call and a put,

123
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,160
both with the strike of $1,250 and maturity

124
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,240
in September of 2011.

125
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,200
These are plotted against the price of the underlying index.

126
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,050
We see that the price of the call option

127
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,770
is increasing in the underlying price.

128
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,230
The slope, which is the options delta,

129
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,890
is higher for higher index values, which is where the call

130
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,380
option is in-the-money.

131
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,490
This illustrates the higher delta of the in-the-money call

132
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,040
options.
