PROFESSOR: To approximate a continuous distribution

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,370
of asset returns using a binomial model--

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,340
we need to increase the number of binomial steps

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,390
relative to the physical length of the time period.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,480
As we reduce the length of each time step,

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,450
we hold the maturity of the option fixed.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,840
As a result, we can make sure that the binomial distribution

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,950
of log returns converges to a normal distribution.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,040
The key model parameters are u and d.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,280
These parameters control the magnitude of price changes

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,610
with each step of the binomial tree.

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,970
We choose u and d to reflect the distribution of stock returns.

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,280
One possible choice is as follows.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,710
U is the exponential of the return volatility

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,030
times the square root of the timestep of the tree.

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,285
d is inversely related to u.

17
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:02,250
The probability of the up move of the tree

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,739
does not affect option prices.

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,080
We specify it here for completeness.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,110
For some computations, we might want to compute objects

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,720
like expected returns, which require

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,070
modeling the physical distribution of stock returns.

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,380
We said the probability of the up move

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,810
to be equal to 1/2 plus 1/2 of the ratio of mu

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,290
to sigma times the square root of the timestep.

26
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,700
Here, mu is the expected stock return continuously compounded,

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,430
and sigma is the standard deviation of log returns.

28
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,550
We refer to sigma as the volatility of stock returns

29
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,560
or, in short, stocks' volatility.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,100
Our construction here illustrates how a binomial tree

31
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,950
could be used to approximate a continuous distribution

32
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,080
of stock returns, the so-called log normal distribution.

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,230
We should note that the parameterization we show here

34
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,970
is not unique.

35
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,880
We could parameterize the binomial tree differently

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,960
to converge to the same limiting distribution.

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,780
We could also define the parameters of the tree

38
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,260
so that result in distribution is not log normal.

39
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,130
For example, if we allowed the magnitude of the price change

40
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,790
to vary across the tree, we can approximate stock return

41
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,480
processes with time-varying conditional variance.

42
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,070
The binomial tree is a highly flexible and versatile model,

43
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,660
which can be used to approximate empirically realistic processes

44
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,500
for stock returns.

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,000
