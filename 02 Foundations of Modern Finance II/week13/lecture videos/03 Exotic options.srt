1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,510
PROFESSOR: We now apply the risk-neutral valuation method

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,940
to exotic options.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,580
The payoff of exotic options is typically path dependent.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,310
For example, consider an up-and-out put option.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,690
This option pays off as a regular European put

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,900
unless, at some point during the life of the option,

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,800
the price of the stock exceeds a barrier specified by the option

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,590
contract.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,830
The payoff of an up-and-out put depends

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,930
on the maximum stock price observed

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,060
over the life of the option contract.

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,540
As a result, the payoff of the option at maturity

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,780
depends not only on the stock price at that date,

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,250
but on all preceding values of the stock price.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,990
In other words, the payoff depends on the entire path

16
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,130
of the stock price.

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,970
It is path dependent.

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,310
When it comes to path-dependent options,

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,400
our original approach to pricing by replication

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,200
is not practical.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,530
The challenge is that the number of nodes on the binomial tree

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,730
grows exponentially with the number of time periods.

23
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,920
Know that without path dependence,

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,140
the three recombines.

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,450
The ud node is the same as the du node, and so on.

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,280
This drastically reduces the number

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,090
of steps we need to take along the tree.

28
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,220
The risk-neutral approach to valuation

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,900
can be used effectively for pricing of exotic options.

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,640
The key difference is that under the risk-neutral approach,

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,990
we can estimate the option price by Monte Carlo simulation.

32
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,950
Specifically, we sample from the set of terminal nodes

33
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,830
according to their risk-neutral probabilities

34
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,260
and use their relatively small sample

35
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,640
to estimate the true expected value of the option payoff.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,720
We do not need to visit all terminal nodes.

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,620
Monte Carlo simulation has many applications in finance.

38
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,420
It is based on the law of large numbers,

39
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,970
the same mathematical relation that

40
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,470
allows us to estimate unknown population moments from finance

41
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,480
historical samples.

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,270
Once we estimate the price of the option using

43
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,370
the risk-neutral formulation, we can

44
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,160
compute the composition of the replicating portfolio

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,740
at any node.

46
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,600
The simplification is that we need

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,105
to compute the replicating portfolio only

48
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:30,160
at the nodes of the three visited by the stock price.

49
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,650
We can do this in real time.

50
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,590
We do not need to compute the replicating portfolio

51
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,140
at every single node, which is what

52
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,270
creates the computational bottleneck

53
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,870
for the original replication approach.

54
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,690
As an example, consider the so-called Asian option.

55
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,600
This is a path-dependent exotic option

56
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,260
for which the payoff is based on the average realized stock

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,870
price over the life of the option.

58
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,220
Specifically, assume that there are two periods in the model.

59
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,690
Cap T is equal to 2.

60
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,440
Consider the Asian call option with a strike price of $40.

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,270
Its payoff is equal to the maximum of 0

62
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,250
and the difference between the average stock

63
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,500
price between 0 and 2 and the strike price of $40.

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,330
We represent the payoff of the option

65
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,330
at expiration of the binomial tree on the right.

66
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,060
Note that the payoff at the ud node

67
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,630
is not the same as at the du node.

68
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:40,670
This reflects the path-dependent nature of the Asian option.

69
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,770
We compute the price of the call using

70
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,490
the risk-neutral valuation formula.

71
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,550
We average the payoff of the option over the terminal

72
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,610
nodes of the tree using the risk-neutral probabilities

73
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,370
as weights.

74
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,160
Then, we discount the result at time 0 at the risk-free rate.

75
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,560
The time 0 price of the option is $14.46.

76
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,570
Next, we illustrate how to compute

77
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,180
the replicating portfolio.

78
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,920
Note that we can follow this approach

79
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,380
to compute the replicating portfolio as needed

80
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,330
for any visited node.

81
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,300
For example, to compute the replicating portfolio

82
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,370
at the node u at time 1, we need to know the price of the option

83
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:28,490
only in the current node and in the nodes uu and ud, which

84
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,810
follow the current time 1 node u.

85
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,100
To replicate the option, we buy delta shares of the stock

86
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,290
and invest b dollars at the risk-free rate.

87
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,440
The delta of the option is equal to the difference

88
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,720
between the option prices in nodes uu and ud

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,750
divided by the corresponding difference in stock prices.

90
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,390
The size of the bond position in the portfolio

91
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,170
is equal to the difference between the option price

92
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,960
and the value of the stock position, which

93
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,410
is delta times the stock price at node u at time 1.
