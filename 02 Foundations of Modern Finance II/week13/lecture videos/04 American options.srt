00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,880
PROFESSOR: We now consider valuation of American options.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,640
Recall that the holder of an American option

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,580
may decide to exercise at any point before maturity.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,610
Because of the possibility of early exercise,

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,030
pricing an American option is more challenging than pricing

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,800
its European counterpart.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,170
The payoff of the option depends on the exercise policy.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,990
The optimal exercise decision, in turn,

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,790
depends on the prices of the option along the tree.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,260
In other words, the price of the option and the optimal exercise

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,690
strategy are closely linked and must

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,790
be computed simultaneously.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,280
The risk neutral relation connects option prices

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,290
across periods.

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,420
At any node at time t, the option price, P sub t,

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,460
is equal to the maximum of the option

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,460
payoff, if exercised immediately,

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,560
and the continuation value.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,190
The continuation value is equal to the value of the option

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,510
if it is allowed to continue unexercised for one more period

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,270
and after that follows the optimal exercise strategy.

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,940
In other words, the continuation value

23
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,530
is equal to the discounted value of the option next period.

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,260
Consider a numerical example.

25
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,170
This is an American put option on the stock

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,710
with a strike price of $100.

27
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:36,050
The price of the stock starts at $100 and rises or falls by 20%

28
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,050
each period.

29
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,060
The interest rate is 10% per period.

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,420
We compute the risk neutral probabilities first.

31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,450
q is equal to 0.75.

32
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,870
Consider the up node at time 1 first.

33
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:59,990
In this case, the continuation value is equal to 0.91.

34
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,050
This is the risk neutral expectation of the option value

35
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,800
next period, which is $1, discounted

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,669
at the 10% rate over one period.

37
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,640
If one were to exercise the option at that node,

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,070
the payoff would be negative, since the stock

39
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,260
price is above the strike.

40
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,320
We conclude that the immediate exercise is not optimal,

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,530
and the price of the option at node u

42
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,690
is equal to the continuation value.

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,780
Next, consider node d at time 1.

44
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,010
Here, the continuation value is $10.91.

45
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,400
The payoff from immediate exercise is $20.

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,010
The strike price is $100.

47
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,680
And the current price of the stock is $80.

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,920
We conclude that it is optimal to exercise the option

49
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,310
immediately at this node.

50
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,650
As a result, the price of the option

51
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,460
is equal to the payoff from its exercise, or $20.

52
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,610
We proceed back to time 0 and perform the same computation.

53
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,980
The continuation value at time 0 is

54
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,470
equal to the discounted value of the option price

55
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,220
at time 1, which is 0.91 in the up

56
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,300
node and 20 in the down node.

57
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,580
This gives us $5.17.

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,210
The payoff from immediate exercise is 0,

59
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,050
and we conclude that the initial price of this American put

60
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,170
is $5.17.

61
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,560
We now illustrate how to replicate the American option

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,240
by dynamic trading.

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,620
The overall approach is the same as for the European options.

64
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,520
We compute the option's delta from option prices and stock

65
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,080
prices.

66
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,930
For example, consider the time 0 node.

67
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,390
To compute the delta of the option here,

68
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,840
we need to know option prices in the up and down nodes

69
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,270
next period.

70
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:10,430
These are 0.91 and 20, respectively.

71
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,150
We take the difference between these two prices of the option

72
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,600
and divide by the difference between the corresponding stock

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,680
prices--

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,550
$120 minus $80.

75
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,680
We find that the delta is minus 0.48.

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,040
This means that, under the replication strategy,

77
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,490
we should short sell 0.48 shares of the stock at time 0.

78
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,910
Combine the proceeds with the $5.17 initial option price,

79
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,480
and invest the proceeds for one period at the risk-free rate.

80
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,120


81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,900
Next period, we rebalance the replicating portfolio using

82
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,470
the same sequence of steps.
