1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,850
PROFESSOR: If we reduce the time length of the binomial step

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,900
towards 0 holding the maturity date of the option fixed,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,480
our pricing formula for the European call

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,600
converges in the limit to the highlighted expression.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,880
This pricing formula is the famous Black-Scholes-Merton

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,100
formula for the prices of European call options.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,010
This formula uses our standard notation

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,930
with the addition of one new element,

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,490
the function N here denotes the cumulative distribution

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,740
function of the standard normal random variable.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,980
Note that just like for the binomial model,

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,050
the option price depends on the strike

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,180
price of the option and its time to maturity, the initial stock

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,470
price, the risk-free rate, and the standard deviation of stock

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,760
returns.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,690
Option price does not depend on the expected stock return which

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,600
corresponds to the probability of the up or down move

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,700
in the binomial model.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,489


20
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,580
As we discussed, in the limit of the timestep

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,220
of the binomial tree converging to 0,

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,320
the distribution of stock returns

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,190
converges to a log normal distribution.

24
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,710
This type of process for the stock price

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,830
is known as the geometric Brownian motion.

26
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,250
The original derivation of the Black-Scholes-Merton model

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,830
does not start with the binomial model.

28
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,260
Instead, it begins with the assumption

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,020
that the stock price follows the geometric Brownian

30
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,420
motion so that stock returns are log normally distributed.

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,870
Then, the replication argument can

32
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,970
be used to derive the expression for the option price.

33
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,910
This requires advanced mathematical methods

34
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,730
for dealing with continuous time-price processes

35
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,550
and portfolio rebalancing.

36
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,440
These methods are known as stochastic calculus.

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,270
In contrast, our derivation here uses the binomial model

38
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,880
and does not require such advanced mathematics.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,130
Let's take a closer look at the Black-Scholes-Merton formula.

40
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,770
We know that the value of the option

41
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,120
is equal to the value of its replicating portfolio.

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,550
The replicating portfolio for a call

43
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,590
is a levered long position in the stock.

44
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,620
The first term in the formula corresponds to the dollar

45
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,170
amount invested in the stock.

46
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,720
It's a product of the stock price

47
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,940
and the number of shares of the stock

48
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,280
in the replicating portfolio.

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,800
The second term in the formula reflects

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,900
the dollar amount borrowed.

51
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,680
As we just pointed out, the term N of x

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,600
is the number of shares of the stock

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,360
in the replicating portfolio, or the options delta.

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,940
It is the limit of the binomial formula

55
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,200
as the timestep converges to 0 and single-period stock price

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,990
movements become infinitesimal.

57
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,200
We can see that in the limit, the binomial expression

58
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,860
for the options delta converges to the partial derivative

59
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,970
of the option price with respect to the stock price, which

60
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,600
is equal to N of x.

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,640
We are now in a position to investigate

62
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,200
how stock return volatility affects option prices.

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,600
We do this in the context of the Black-Scholes-Merton model,

64
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,500
which is the limit of the binomial model.

65
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,070
This model imposes two important assumptions.

66
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,440
The stock price follows the geometric Brownian motion,

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,310
which means that stock returns are log normal

68
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,730
and independently and identically distributed

69
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,050
across non-overlapping periods.

70
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,430
The interest rate is constant.

71
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,790
Under the Black-Scholes-Merton model, prices of European

72
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,420
calls and puts increase with stock return volatility.

73
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,610
To see why option values increase

74
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,200
with the volatility of the underlying

75
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,230
asset under the Black-Scholes-Merton model,

76
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,760
consider a simple binomial example.

77
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,670
We have two firms, A and B, with the same current price of $100.

78
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,070
There are two states next period, good and bad.

79
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,930
B has higher volatility of future prices.

80
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,840
Its value is lower in the bad state

81
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,130
and higher in the good state compared to A.

82
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,550
Consider a call options written on A and B

83
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,320
with the same exercise price of $100.

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,510
The call on B pays off more than the call on A in the good state

85
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,910
and the same amount in the bad state.

86
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,760
It is clear that the call on stock B

87
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,890
should be more valuable.

88
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,230
Higher volatility of stock returns

89
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,250
means that at expiration, we are more likely to see

90
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,340
very high and very low returns.

91
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,340
This raises the value of the call option.

92
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,100
The call option benefits from high underlying price

93
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,360
at maturity, while the payoff of the option for low underlying

94
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,060
prices is capped at 0.

95
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,730
The option provides upside participation,

96
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,500
but limited downside.

97
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,950
It benefits from higher volatility.

98
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,740
Similar logic applies to the put options,

99
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,750
which are connected to the calls by the put-call parity.
