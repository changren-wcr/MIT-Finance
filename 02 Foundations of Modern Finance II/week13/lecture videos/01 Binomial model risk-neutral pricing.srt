PROFESSOR: This week, we continue our exploration

1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,620
of option pricing.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,910
We developed the risk-neutral pricing method,

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,120
which is a powerful and widely used

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,460
approach to option valuation.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,480
We applied this framework to pricing of exotic options.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,000
We also derived the Black-Scholes-Merton option

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,690
pricing model and discussed its empirical implementation.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,990
In this section, we introduced the risk-neutral approach

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,150
to option pricing.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,020
Risk-neutral valuation method was introduced in the 1970s

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,260
by John Cox and Stephen Ross.

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,890
We start with the binomial model in its general form.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,530
Stock price follows a binomial process rising by multiple of u

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,870
or falling by a multiple of d over the next period.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,308
The risk-free interest rate is equal to r.

16
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:55,140
To avoid arbitrage, we assume that the stock

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,070
return and the bond return do not dominate each other.

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,580
In the up node, the stock performs better than the bond.

19
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,680
And in the down node, the bond outperforms the stock.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,020
Formally, we impose the restriction

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,160
that u exceeds 1 plus r, which is greater than d.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,620
Consider an option on the stock.

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,680
To be specific, let it be a call option with a strike

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,800
price of k.

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,390
Its payoff is a function of the stock price at expiration.

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,960
It's the maximum of 0 and the difference between the stock

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,120
price and the strike.

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,700
As we did in our numerical example,

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,710
we priced the option by replication.

30
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,220
We form a replicating portfolio with delta shares

31
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,320
of the stock and B dollars in the riskless bond.

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,410
We require that the value of the replicating portfolio

33
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,680
matches the value of the option at each node next period.

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,380
This imposes two restrictions on delta and B.

35
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,260
We find a unique solution for the composition

36
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,229
of the replicating portfolio.

37
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,380
We then expressed the option price at time 0

38
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,230
as the initial value of the replicating portfolio.

39
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,530
Recall that this follows from the law of one price.

40
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,830
The option and its replicating portfolio

41
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,560
have the same payoff next period in each state.

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,820
Therefore, they must trade at the same current price.

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,480
Next, we rewrite the expression for the option price

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,130
to reveal the risk-neutral pricing formula.

45
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,080
First, define two numbers, q sub u and q sub d,

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,530
in relation to stock returns in the up and down nodes

47
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,770
and the risk-free rate.

48
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,190
Note that according to our definition,

49
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,720
these two numbers are positive and sum up to 1.

50
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,360
Because of that, we can interpret these numbers

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,930
as probabilities for the up and down states

52
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,150
on the binomial tree.

53
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,720
From here on, we will use q to denote the probability

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,520
corresponding to the up node, and then 1 minus q corresponds

55
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,590
to the down node.

56
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,670
We now return to our general expression for the option price

57
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,520
and rewrite it using the q probabilities.

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,490
We find that the option price at time 0

59
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,690
is equal to the expected value of the options payoff

60
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,290
using q probabilities discounted at the risk-free rate.

61
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,570
q probabilities are called the risk-neutral probabilities.

62
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,530
The reason for this name is that we are discounting the expected

63
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,050
payoff on the q probabilities at the risk-free rate.

64
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,310
This is how the discounted cash flow formula would look

65
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,960
if investors were risk neutral.

66
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,300
Keep in mind that q probabilities are

67
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,580
a convenient mathematical construct,

68
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,220
and our interpretation of these numbers in relation

69
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,550
to risk neutrality is an intuitive analogy,

70
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,680
but we do not impose any restrictions

71
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,490
on investors' preferences.

72
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,490
We do not know how risk averse investors are,

73
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,920
and we do not need to know that.

74
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,769
Our pricing results are based entirely

75
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,640
on arbitrage arguments.

76
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,160
Risk-neutral pricing may seem like a bit

77
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,870
of mathematical magic.

78
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,760
We derive the option pricing formula

79
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,330
using the law of one price and the dynamic replication

80
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,560
argument.

81
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,310
Then, at the very end, we rewrite the valuation formula

82
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,800
using risk-neutral probabilities.

83
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,140
Why is this possible?

84
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,350
To gain some intuition, let's start with the knowledge

85
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,890
that the payoff of any option can be replicated by trading

86
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,380
in the stock and the bond.

87
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,830
We will not use the exact option pricing formula, only

88
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,370
the notion that replication is possible.

89
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,550
Change the probabilities of the up/down stock price

90
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,930
changes so that the expected return of the stock

91
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,750
becomes equal to the risk-free rate at each node.

92
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,100
We call these new probabilities q probabilities.

93
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,090
Then, expected return on the replicating portfolio

94
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,170
under these q probabilities equals the risk-free rate.

95
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,190
This is because the return on the portfolio

96
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,640
is a weighted average of returns on its positions,

97
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,960
and both the stock and the bond have the same expected return

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,980
under the q probabilities, the risk-free rate.

99
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,920
Next, we apply the discounted cash flow formula

100
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,340
to determine the value of the replicating portfolio, which

101
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,550
is the same as the payoff of the option.

102
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,000
The discount rate and the discounted cash flow relation

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,290
is the expected return on the replicating portfolio, computed

104
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,870
under the q probabilities.

105
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,780
Based on our construction, this discount rate

106
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,670
is the risk-free rate.

107
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,900
We reach the conclusion that the price of the option at time 0

108
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,990
is equal to its expected payoff evaluated

109
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,720
under the q probabilities discounted

110
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,340
at the risk-free interest rate.

111
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,910


112
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,580
Notice that we are able to derive

113
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,010
the risk-neutral valuation formula using

114
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,980
only the result that dynamic replication is possible.

115
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
We did not use the exact expression

116
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,120
for the replicating portfolio or the option price.

117
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,930
Also, note that the q probabilities we introduce here

118
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,470
must be given by our formula for the risk-neutral probabilities.

119
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,695
There is only one way to assign the probability

120
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,530
to the up node on the tree to make expected stock

121
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,990
return equal to the risk-free rate.

122
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,080
We can price all assets in the model using

123
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,290
the risk-neutral probabilities.

124
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,570
For example, the initial price of the stock

125
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,360
is equal to the expected value of the terminal stock

126
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,840
price computed under the risk-neutral probabilities

127
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,000
discounted at the risk-free rate.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,470
In our numerical example, with u equal to 1.5 and d

129
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:18,910
equal to 0.5, the q probability of the up move is 0.6.

130
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,990
Then, we confirm that the initial stock price of $50

131
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,220
is indeed equal to the expected terminal price discounted

132
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,500
at the 10% interest rate.

133
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,050
For the bond, the risk-neutral valuation formula

134
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,380
clearly holds.

135
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,890
And the option price at time 0 computed

136
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,020
using the risk-neutral formula is

137
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,000
the same as the price we have derived

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,130
using dynamic replication.

139
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,410
This has to be the case, of course, based

140
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:53,090
on our general definition of the risk-neutral valuation formula.

141
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,180
In summary, the risk-neutral price simulation

142
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,690
applies to the basic assets, the stock, and the bond,

143
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,940
and to all options on the stock.

144
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,730
In a multi-period model, we use the same approach.

145
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,340
All we need is to compute the probabilities

146
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,860
of the various nodes in the tree using

147
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,920
the risk-neutral transition probabilities between nodes

148
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,000
each period.

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,300
We then discount expected payoffs

150
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,130
at the risk-free rate over multiple periods.

151
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,290
The numerical examples here illustrate

152
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,050
how to compute the prices of the European call

153
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,120
and put options in a two-period binomial model.
