00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,790
PROFESSOR: To implement the Black-Scholes-Merton formula,

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:09,150
we need to estimate volatility of stock returns, or sigma.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,460
All the other inputs entered in the formula

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,200
are known precisely--

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,480
the current stock price, the strike

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,400
of the option, time to maturity, and the interest rate.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,770
Stock return volatility is the only input

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,720
that needs to be estimated.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,440
There are two ways to estimate the volatility parameter.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,750
One approach is to use historical return volatility.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,620
For that, we develop statistical estimates of volatility

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,190
using past returns on the underlying asset.

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,220
For example, one simple approach is

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,610
to use daily returns over a given period

15
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,580
to estimate daily volatility as the sample standard

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,590
deviation of stock returns.

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,540
We then analyze our estimate by multiplying daily volatility

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,260
by the square root of 252, which is the number of trading

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,330
days in a year.

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,630
Another approach is to use what is called implied volatility.

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,410
Under this approach, we price options relative to each other.

22
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:19,260
Let's say that we observe market prices of some other options.

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,600
We assume that these prices satisfy

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,190
the Black-Scholes-Merton formula and solve for the volatility

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,300
parameter to find the implied volatility.

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,680
As an example, suppose we need to price a call on a stock

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,780
with a strike price of $110 and time to maturity of one year.

28
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,380
Suppose that the current stock price is $100,

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,300
and the one-year interest rate is 6.18%.

30
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,910
Suppose we observe another call option with a strike

31
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:58,450
price of $120 trading at $3.16.

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,220
The implied volatility of that other option,

33
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,730
which reconciles its market price

34
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,520
with the Black-Scholes-Merton model, is 19%.

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,110


36
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,490
We then use 19% in the Black-Scholes-Merton formula

37
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,020
to price the call with a strike of $110.

38
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,230
One problem with this approach is that, in the data,

39
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,960
implied volatility may be different for options

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,000
with different strikes and maturities.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,660
These empirical patterns of how implied volatility changes

42
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,120
across strikes and across maturities

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,210
are called volatility smiles and smirks because of their shape.

44
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,060
As we can see from the Bloomberg screenshot,

45
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,760
implied volatilities of options on IBM

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,470
are not equal across strikes and maturities.

47
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,110
The implied volatility column shows

48
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,390
that the implied volatility declines with the strike.

49
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,210
We observe this pattern for each of the three option

50
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,570
maturities shown here.

51
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,350
We also observe that the implied volatilities are not

52
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,440
flat across option maturities.

53
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,750
Here, we don't see a clear pattern.

54
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,630
But know that, for example, for the options with the strike

55
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,360
price of $130, implied volatility

56
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,460
is the lowest for the shorter maturity contracts.

57
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,440
The fact that implied volatilities

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,020
depend on the strike price of the option

59
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,950
is clearly at odds with the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

60
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,620
Under that model, the implied volatility

61
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,020
is equal to the physical volatility of stock returns,

62
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,490
which is a constant.

63
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,220
In practice, it is common to extend

64
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,100
the Black-Scholes-Merton model by adding features

65
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,550
like stochastic return volatility or discontinuous

66
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,610
return changes in order to better reconcile

67
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,240
the model with the data.

68
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,310
In the marketplace, the original Black-Scholes-Merton model

69
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,550
is used to compute implied volatilities, which

70
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,090
are commonly used to quote prices of options.

71
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,050
For that, the model itself does not need to be valid.

72
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,270
The implied volatility is always well-defined.

73
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,300
The next plot shows a historical series

74
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,480
for a popular summary of option-implied volatilities,

75
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,690
VIX.

76
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,570
VIX aggregates implied volatilities

77
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,960
across call and put options with different strikes

78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,880
with a horizon close to 30 days.

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,930
VIX is widely used as an indicator of short-term market

80
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,600
volatility as derived from the options markets.

81
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,170
We should note that just like the forward interest rate

82
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,590
is a biased predictor of the future spot rates,

83
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,740
VIX is a biased predictor of the future stock return volatility.

84
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,250
This is because in addition to volatility expectations,

85
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,730
the current level of VIX also reflects a risk premium.

86
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,400
As we see from the plot, VIX tends

87
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,600
to fluctuate in the range of 10% to 20% most of the time,

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,450
with occasional spikes during periods of increased

89
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,630
economic uncertainty.

90
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,060
We see, for example, a large spike

91
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,740
during the global financial crisis

92
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,470
and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

93
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,080
Relative to other measures of uncertainty,

94
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,310
VIX provides a current market-based, forward-looking

95
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,330
measure of market volatility.
