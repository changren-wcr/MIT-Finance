INSTRUCTOR: The concept of risk-neutral probabilities

1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,230
is closely related to the concept of state prices.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,410
Consider a primitive state contingent claim.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,690
It's basically a digital option.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,980
It pays off $1.00 only in a given future state and nothing

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,620
otherwise.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,330
For example, a digital option that pays $1.00 at time 2 only

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,070
if the price of the stock goes up in both periods defines

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,550
a state contingent claim on the highest node of the tree

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,120
at time 2.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,660
Denote the price of our digital option by phi.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,850
This is the state price of the highest

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,370
state on the tree at time 2 or the Arrow-Debreu state price.

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,950
We can define state prices for all other states

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,110
in a similar manner.

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,740
Each state price is simply the market price of a financial

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,850
claim paying $1.00 only in a particular future state

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,110
and nothing otherwise.

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,590


19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,840
Using the risk-neutral probabilities,

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,990
we know how to compute the market prices of such state

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,250
contingent claims.

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,730
Their prices are given by the expectation of the payoff

23
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,580
and the q probabilities discounted

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,490
at the risk-free interest rate.

25
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,190
Note that the payoff of a primitive state contingent

26
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,920
claim is concentrated in a single state.

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,340
Then the risk-neutral expected value of the payoff

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,570
is equal to the q probability of the corresponding state.

29
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,660
We have derived a relation between state price

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,360
and the risk-neutral probability.

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,100
State prices are proportional to the risk-neutral probabilities.

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,530
In addition to the later, they also

33
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,310
reflect the time value of money, or the risk-free rate.

34
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,490
Once we know the state prices, we

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,190
can value any state contingent payoff

36
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,040
as a portfolio of state contingent claims.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,220
This is mathematical equivalent to the risk-neutral valuation

38
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,500
formula.

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,000
