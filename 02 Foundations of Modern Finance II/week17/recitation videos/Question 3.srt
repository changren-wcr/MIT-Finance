00:00:00,185 --> 00:00:01,560
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,227
show how to estimate the cost of capital

3
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:06,450
for divisions in a multidivisional firm.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,420
The Brandywine Corporation has two divisions of equal market

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,080
value: the brandy division and the wine division.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,010
The debt-to-equity ratio of Brandywine is 2 to 9.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,890
The company's debt is risk free.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,290
For the last few years, the brandy division

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,990
has been using a discount rate of 11%

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,530
in capital budgeting decisions, while the wine division has

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,140
been using a discount rate of 10%.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,240
The current risk-free rate is 5%,

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,880
and the expected rate of return on the market portfolio is 10%.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,560
We will answer the following questions.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,230
What is the beta of typical projects

16
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,760
implicit in the discount rate used by the brandy division?

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,350
What is the beta of typical projects

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,290
implicit in the discount rate used by the wine division?

19
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,060
What is the equity beta of Brandywine

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,000
that is consistent with the discount rates used

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,090
by Brandywine's two divisions?

22
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,020
Let's start by computing the beta of the brandy division.

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,610
Since we're given the discount rate,

24
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,000
we can use the CAPM to back out the beta.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,750
The discount rate used by the brandy division is 11%.

26
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,610
The risk-free rate is 5%.

27
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,600
And the expected return on the market portfolio is 10%.

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,510
This gives us beta of 1.2.

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,480
We can repeat the process for the wine division.

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,050
The discount rate used by the wine division is 10%.

31
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,801
This implies the beta of 1.

32
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,540
Note that the discount rate used by the wine division

33
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,270
is the same as the return on the market portfolio.

34
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,320
Therefore, it has to have a beta of 1.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,650
Next, let's find the equity beta of Brandywine

36
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,950
that is implied by the discount rates used by the brandy

37
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,810
and wine divisions.

38
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,460
In order to do that, we first need

39
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,520
to find asset beta of Brandywine.

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,340
Asset beta of Brandywine equals to the weighted average

41
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,370
of asset betas of its divisions.

42
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,160
Since both divisions have equal market value,

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,020
their weight in Brandywine is 0.5 for both of them.

44
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,449
Given the betas of brandy and wine divisions,

45
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,280
we find that asset beta of Brandywine is 1.1.

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,590
To find equity beta of Brandywine,

47
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,580
we will use Modigliani-Miller proposition 2.

48
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,630
Recall the debt-to-equity ratio of Brandywine is 2 to 9,

49
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,730
and its debt is risk free, which implies debt beta of 0.

50
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,420
Combining these with Brandywine's asset beta of 1.1,

51
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,220
we find that equity beta of Brandywine is 1.34.

52
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,440
Supposed that you were hired as a consultant

53
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,900
to advise on the use of discount rates

54
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,250
in the brandy and wine divisions of Brandywine.

55
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,980
As the first step, you have estimated equity beta

56
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,090
and confirmed that it equals to 1.34.

57
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,520
Next, you found a publicly traded firm

58
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,600
called Pure Brandy Corporation, which operates in the brandy

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,010
business.

60
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,020
You have estimated its equity beta

61
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,150
and found that it equals to 1.8.

62
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,170
The debt-to-equity ratio of Pure Brandy is 1 to 4,

63
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,870
and its debt beta is 0.2.

64
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,670
What discount rates would you recommend

65
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,400
for projects in the brandy and in the wine

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,130
division of Brandywine?

67
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,010
Let's start by making two observations.

68
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,070
First, since you confirmed that the equity beta of Brandywine

69
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,860
is 1.34, this means that asset beta of Brandywine is 1.1.

70
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,330
Second, we can find betas for each division of Brandywine

71
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,590
by using the information on Pure Brandy Corp.

72
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,590
Let's find asset beta of Pure Brandy.

73
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,780
Recall that asset beta is the weighted average

74
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,450
of debt and equity betas.

75
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,320
The debt-to-equity ratio of Pure Brandy is 1 to 4.

76
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,980
This means that debt-to-value ratio is 1 to 5,

77
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,100
and equity-to-value ratio is 4 to 5.

78
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,130
Recall that debt beta of Pure Brandy is 0.2,

79
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,290
and its equity beta is 1.8.

80
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,720
This gives us the asset beta of 1.48.

81
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,150
Now, we can use asset beta of Brandywine

82
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,160
and the asset beta of Pure Brandy

83
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,649
to back out asset beta of the wine division.

84
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,460
Recall that asset beta of Brandywine is 1.1.

85
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,250
Asset beta of Pure Brandy division, which we just found,

86
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,350
is 1.48, and the division weights are 50%.

87
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,970
This gives us wine beta of 0.72.

88
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,240
We can see that the business risk of brandy division,

89
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,540
as measured by asset beta, is more than twice

90
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,800
as high as the business risk of the wine division.

91
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,970
Knowing asset betas, we can find discount rates using the CAPM.

92
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,850
For the brandy division, you should advise the firm

93
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,800
to use the discount rate of 12.4% instead of 11%

94
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,220
that they traditionally have used.

95
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,530
And, for the wine division, you should advise the firm

96
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,730
to use the discount rate of 8.6% instead of 10%

97
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,480
that they have traditionally used.

98
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,053
