00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:01,440
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,160
learn how to use a binomial tree model to price risky debt.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,039
Consider a market with two possible states one year

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,590
from now: good or bad.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,140
In the good state, the return on the market portfolio

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,580
will be 25%.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,070
And in the bad state, the return on the market portfolio

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,200
will be negative 25%.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,620
The probability of the good state is 70%.

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,140
The one-year, risk-free rate is 5%.

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,910
Consider a corporate bond.

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,260
It has a 0% coupon rate and matures one year from now.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,740
The face value of the bond is $100.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,130
In the good state, the bond has a 2% probability of default,

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,920
and a recovery rate of 60%.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,400
In the bad state, the bond has a 10% probability of default,

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,370
and the recovery rate of 40%.

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,950
We will answer the following questions.

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,920
Compute the expected payoff of the bond in each of the two

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,483
states one year from now.

21
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:57,150
Determine the risk-neutral probabilities

22
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,610
of the good and bad states.

23
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,390
Compute the price of the corporate bond in year 0.

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,310
Compute the bond's promised yield,

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,600
expected yield, the default premium, and the risk premium.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,700
Suppose that the CAPM holds.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,910
Based on one-year returns, what is the market beta

28
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,440
of the corporate bond in this question?

29
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,920
Let's first compute the expected payoff of the bond one year

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,140
from now in the good state.

31
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,640
With 98% probability, the issuer of the bond will not default,

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,020
and we will get the full promised payment of $100.

33
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,350
With probability of 2%, the bond will default, in which case,

34
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,010
our recovery rate is 60%.

35
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,660
This means that we will receive 60% of the $100 that

36
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,910
was promised to us.

37
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,720
This gives us the expected payoff of $99.20.

38
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,130
Similarly, we can compute the expected payoff of the bond one

39
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,350
year from now in the bad state.

40
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,170
With 90% probability, the bond will not default,

41
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,780
and we will get $100.

42
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,630
With probability 10%, the bond will default. In this case,

43
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,039
we recover 40% of the $100 face value.

44
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,350
This gives us the expected payoff of $94.

45
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,930


46
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,390
Next, let's find the risk-neutral probabilities

47
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,700
of the good and bad states.

48
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,400
Recall that the market portfolio one year from now

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,590
either goes up by 25% or goes down by 25%.

50
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,390
Using our standard notation, this

51
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:37,050
implies that multiple u is 1.25 and multiple d is 0.75.

52
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,210
The risk-neutral probability of the up-move

53
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,590
is 1 plus r f minus d divided by u minus d.

54
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,420
Risk-free rate is 5%.

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,430
u is 1.25, and d is 0.75, which gives us

56
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,423
the risk-neutral probability of the up move of 60%.

57
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,340
This implies that the risk-neutral probability

58
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,710
of the down move is 40%.

59
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,270
Knowing risk-neutral probabilities

60
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,160
and expected payoffs from the bond

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,390
in the good and bad states, we can price this bond today.

62
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,450
Its current price equals the expected payoff one year

63
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,910
from now under the risk-neutral measure

64
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,330
discounted to present at the risk-free rate.

65
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,700
Plugging in the numbers from parts a and b of this question,

66
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,550
we find that the current price of this bond is $92.50.

67
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,080
Next, let's find the promised yield

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,260
on this bond, the expected yield, the default premium,

69
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,180
and the risk premium.

70
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,350
Since this bond pays no coupons and matures one year from now,

71
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,530
its promised yield equals its face value divided

72
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,560
by its current price minus 1.

73
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,690
Plugging in the numbers, we find that the promised

74
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,150
yield on this bond is 8.11%.

75
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,750
To compute the expected yield on this bond,

76
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,930
instead of using the face value that was promised to us,

77
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,280
we're using the payoff we expect to receive from this bond.

78
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,640
The expected payoff in year one is the physical probability

79
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,480
of the good state, which is 70%, multiplied by the expected

80
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,680
payoff in the good state, which is $99.20,

81
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,790
plus the physical probability of the bad state, which is 30%,

82
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,640
multiplied by the expected payoff in the bad state,

83
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,950
which is $94.

84
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,120
We see that the expected yield on this bond is 5.56%.

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,990
The default premium, by definition,

86
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,540
is the difference between the promised yield and the expected

87
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,500
yield.

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:36,000
In our case, this is 8.11% minus 5.56%, which equals to 2.55%.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
The risk premium is the difference

90
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,030
between the expected yield and the risk-free rate.

91
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:48,510
In our case, this is 5.56% minus 5%, which equals to 0.56%.

92
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,590
Therefore the default premium on this bond is 2.55%,

93
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,520
and the risk premium of this bond is 0.56%.

94
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,380
Finally let's find CAPM beta of this bond.

95
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,170
Recall by CAPM, the expected return on this bond,

96
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,610
which is its expected yield, equals to the risk-free rate

97
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,610
plus beta of this bond multiplied by the market risk

98
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,750
premium.

99
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,100
We know the expected yield.

100
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,290
And we know the risk-free rate.

101
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,480
We need to find the expected return on the market portfolio

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,260
so that we can solve this equation for beta.

103
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,910
The expected return on the market

104
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,130
equals to the probability of the good state, which

105
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,730
is 70%, times the return in the good state, which

106
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:35,010
is 25%, plus the probability of the bad state, which is 30%,

107
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,910
times the return in the bad state, which is negative 25%.

108
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,630
This gives us the expected return of 10%.

109
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,000
Solving the CAPM equation for beta,

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,360
we find that the beta of this bond is 0.1124.

111
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,650
Note that this beta is very close to zero,

112
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,550
implying that this bond has very low systematic risk.

113
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,470
Because of this, the risk premium on this bond,

114
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,820
which we found in part d of this question, is low.

115
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,500
Only 56 basis points.

116
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,000
