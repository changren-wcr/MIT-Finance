1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,500
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,560
consider an example of a firm with multiple tiers of debt

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,510
in its capital structure and learn

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,030
how to price debt and equity in such circumstances.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,460
Suppose that there are two possible states of the economy

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,380
next year: good and bad.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,770
The good state occurs with probability 80%,

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,390
and the bad state occurs with probability 20%.

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,330
Consider a small firm whose assets in year 1

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,110
will be worth $90 million in the good state and $40 million

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,400
in the bad state.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,840
This firm has two bonds outstanding, bond 1 and bond 2.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,830
Both bonds pay 0% coupon and mature in year 1.

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,035
The face value of bond 1 is $40 million,

15
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:43,950
and the face value of bond 2 is $10 million.

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,620
Bond 2 is junior to bond 1.

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,190
This means that, in the event of default, holders of bond 2

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,730
do not receive any payment until holders of bond 1

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,550
receive their promised payment in full.

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,490
We will assume that the one year risk-free rate is 5%

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,352
and that corporations do not pay corporate income taxes.

22
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:05,310
Suppose that the current market value of equity

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,490
is $28.57 million.

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,220
What are the current prices of bonds 1 and 2

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,610
and their promised yields?

26
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,940
What are the expected returns on both bonds and equity

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,840
of this firm?

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,690
Let's start by finding what the holders

29
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,330
of both bonds and equity receive in each state of the economy.

30
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,850
Recall that the face value of bond 1 is $40 million.

31
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,950
And this bond is the most senior claim on this firm's assets.

32
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,870
Since the assets are worth $90 million

33
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,470
in the good state and $40 million in the bad state,

34
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,190
holders of bond 1 will receive their full promised payment

35
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,880
of $40 million in both states.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
Holders of bond 2, however, will not receive anything

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,910
in the bad state because the assets of the firm

38
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,570
will be worth zero after the firm makes the payment

39
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,880
to holders of bond 1.

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,430
The firm will default on its promised payments

41
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,140
to the holders of bond 2.

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,710
Equity holders are residual claimants on firm's assets.

43
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,009
In the good state, they receive $40 million of the payments

44
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,790
to holders of bond 1 and bond 2 are made in full.

45
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,040
In the bad state, however, the value of equity

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,290
is zero since the value of assets

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,240
is large enough only to satisfy the claim of holders of bond 1.

48
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,550
To price both of these bonds, let's start

49
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,350
by finding risk-neutral probabilities

50
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,630
of the up and down states.

51
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,620
We don't know the current value of the firm.

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,460
However, we know its current value of equity.

53
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,950
It is $28.57 million.

54
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,680
Therefore, we can use the current value of equity,

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,120
together with the risk-free rate,

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,290
to find risk-neutral probabilities.

57
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,600
We can write down the following equation.

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,230
The current value of equity should

59
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,990
equal to the risk-neutral probability

60
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,960
of the up state multiplied by the equity value

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,930
in the up state plus the risk-neutral probability

62
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,570
of the down state multiplied by the value of equity

63
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,890
in the down state discounted to present at the risk-free rate.

64
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,460
Note that the value of equity in the down state is zero.

65
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,290
Solving this equation for qu, we get 0.75.

66
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,790
This means that the risk-neutral probability of the up state

67
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,480
is 75%, and the risk-neutral probability of the down state

68
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,190
is 25%.

69
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,960
Knowing risk-neutral probabilities,

70
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,050
we can find current prices of bonds 1 and 2.

71
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,990
The price of bond 1 equals to the risk-neutral probability

72
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,310
of the up state, which is 0.75, times the payoff

73
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,890
from the bond in the up state, which is $40 million,

74
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,640
plus the risk-neutral probability of the down state,

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,940
which is 0.25, times the payoff from the bond

76
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,130
in the down state, which is also $40 million,

77
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,210
discounted to present at the risk-free rate.

78
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,240
Since this bond pays face value in both states,

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,720
its price effectively equals to the face value

80
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,600
discounted to present at the risk-free rate.

81
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,730
It is easy to understand why.

82
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,700
This bond never defaults and always pays in full.

83
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,150
Therefore, it is effectively a risk-free bond.

84
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,750
The price of bond 2 equals qu multiplied

85
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,490
by 10 plus qd multiplied by 0 discounted to present

86
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,120
at the risk-free rate.

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
This gives us $7.14 million.

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,570
The promised yield on the first bond

89
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,800
is simply 5% because this bond is risk free.

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,840
The promised yield on the second bond

91
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,210
is its face value, which is $10 million,

92
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,750
divided by its current price, which is $7.14 million,

93
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,220
minus 1.

94
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,530
This equals to 40%.

95
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,340
This high yield indicates the riskiness of this bond.

96
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,250
Note that, in the down state, holders of this bond

97
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,980
incur a 100% loss rate.

98
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,380
Finally, let's find expected returns

99
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,120
on both bonds and equity of this firm.

100
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,690
The expected return on bond 1 is 5% simply

101
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,210
because it is risk free.

102
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,380
The expected return on bond 2 equals its expected payoff,

103
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,150
which is physical probability of the up

104
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,380
state, 80%, times the payoff in the up state, which

105
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,730
is $10 million, plus physical probability of the down state,

106
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,930
20%, times the payoff in the down state, which is 0,

107
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,230
divided by the current bond price minus 1.

108
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,720
This gives us 12%.

109
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,020
We can decompose the promised yield of the second bond, which

110
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,170
is 40%, into the default premium, risk premium,

111
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,360
and the risk-free rate of return.

112
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,980
We see that the default premium is 28%, four times as large

113
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,000
as the risk premium, which is 7%.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,520
Finally, the expected return on equity of this firm

115
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,810
equals to the expected payoff, which is 80% times $40 million

116
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,710
plus 20% times 0, divided by the current price, which

117
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,640
is $28.57 million, minus 1.

118
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,670
This gives us 12%.

119
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,160
Note that the risk premium on equity of this firm

120
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,920
and on bond 2 are the same.

121
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,610
This should not be surprising because both equity and bond 2

122
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,260
only pay in the up state.

123
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,040
And, in the down state, they're both worthless.

124
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,880
In other words, bond 2 and equity of this firm

125
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,620
are effectively identical securities.
