00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,770
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,500
consider a corporate acquisition and learn

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,880
how to estimate the risk of equity of the merged entity.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,980
Suppose that corporation Y is planning

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,820
to acquire corporation X. We are given the following information

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,110
on firm X.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,120
Its market value of debt is $40 million.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,180
Its market value of equity is $160 million.

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,340
Its cost of debt capital is 7%.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,980
And its equity beta is 1.2.

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,680
We are also given the following information on firm

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,830
Y. Its market value of debt is $100 million.

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,190
Its market value of equity is $900 million.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,960
Its debt is risk free.

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,960
And its asset beta is 0.76.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,980
Transaction details are as follows.

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,980
Y will be financing the acquisition

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,190
with the issuance of new debt.

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,970
The old debt of X will be repurchased.

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,960
The cost of debt for the combined entity will be 8%.

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,740
X will get acquired at the current market value,

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,260
and there will be no synergies in this transaction.

23
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,670
We are also given the following additional information.

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,940
Risk-free rate is 5%.

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,110
The expected return on the market portfolio is 15%.

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,900
Corporations do not pay income taxes.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,750
And there are no other market imperfections.

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,570
What is the equity beta and the expected return

29
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,890
on equity of firm Y after this acquisition is complete?

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,030
Let's start by thinking how to approach solving this problem.

31
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,480
First, to find equity risk of the combined entity,

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,820
we would need to know its capital structure

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,152
and its return on assets.

34
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:45,860
We will be able to figure out the capital

35
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,680
structure of the combined firm from the information

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,350
on the current capital structure of firms X and Y

37
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,020
and on how Y is planning to finance

38
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,770
the acquisition of X. The return on assets of the combined

39
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,130
entity is equal to the weighted average of returns on assets

40
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,210
of firms X and Y. Therefore, to find it,

41
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,380
we first need to find return on assets of X and Y.

42
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,560
With this in mind, we will implement the following steps

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,330
to solve this problem.

44
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,770
First, we will find asset beta of firm X.

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,860
Note that we already know asset beta of firm Y. Second,

46
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,670
we will find the asset beta of the new combined entity.

47
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,680
And, third, we will find equity beta and the return

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,290
on equity of the new firm.

49
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,750
Let's start with asset beta of firm X. Recall

50
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,790
that asset beta is the weighted average of debt and equity

51
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,870
betas.

52
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,960
We know the market values of debt and equity of firm x

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,180
as well as its equity beta.

54
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,280
Therefore, in order to find asset beta,

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,800
we need to find debt beta first.

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,710
To find debt beta, we will use the capital asset pricing

57
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,980
model.

58
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,000
Recall that the cost of debt capital of firm X is 7%.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,830
The risk-free rate is 5%.

60
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,000
And the expected return on the market portfolio is 15%.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,040
Solving this equation for beta, we

62
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,810
find that debt beta of firm X equals to 0.2.

63
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,970
Having found debt beta, we can now

64
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,130
find asset beta of firm X. Recall

65
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,550
that the market value of debt of firm X is $40 million.

66
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,550
The market value of its equity is $160 million.

67
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,950
And its equity beta is 1.2.

68
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,180
Therefore, asset beta of firm X equals to 1.

69
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,540
Let's now move to step two and find asset beta of the combined

70
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,710
firm.

71
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,920
Asset beta of the combined firm equals to the weighted average

72
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,890
of betas of the merging firms where the weights

73
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,100
are computed based on the market values of firms X and Y

74
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,720
in the combined firm.

75
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,790
The market value of firm X is computed

76
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,790
by adding its market value of debt, which is $40 million,

77
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,830
and its market value of equity, which is $160 million.

78
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,330
Hence, the market value of firm X is $200 million.

79
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,690
For firm Y, recall that its market value of debt

80
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,770
is $100 million, and its market value of equity

81
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,570
is now $900 million.

82
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,960
Therefore, the market value of firm Y is $1 billion.

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,180
Recall also that asset beta of firm X, which we just computed,

84
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,170
is 1.

85
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,660
And the asset beta of firm Y is 0.76.

86
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,480
Therefore, the asset beta of the combined firm is 0.8.

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,860
Now, we are ready to implement the final step, step three.

88
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,980
To find equity beta, we will use Modigliani-Miller proposition

89
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,460
2, which states that equity beta equals to the asset

90
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,310
beta plus debt-to-equity ratio multiplied

91
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,520
by the difference between asset beta and debt beta.

92
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,810
We know asset beta.

93
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,500
So what's left to find is the debt-to-equity ratio and debt

94
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,810
beta of the new firm.

95
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,870
To find debt-to-equity ratio of the new firm,

96
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,330
we need to find its value of debt and its value of equity.

97
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,360
Let's start with debt.

98
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,250
The new value of debt will be the value

99
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,890
of the old debt of the acquiring firm, which

100
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:08,740
is firm Y, plus the value of new debt issued to acquire firm X.

101
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,370
To acquire firm X, we need to purchase its equity, which

102
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,390
is valued at $160 million, and to purchase its existing debt,

103
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,670
which is valued at $40 million.

104
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,780
Therefore, we need to issue $200 million of new debt.

105
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,900
This implies that the total value of debt of the new firm

106
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,810
will be $300 million.

107
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,660
To find the value of equity of the combined firm,

108
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,390
we subtract the value of debt from the value of the firm,

109
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,405
which gives us $900 million.

110
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:40,110


111
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,900
Therefore, debt-to-equity ratio of the new firm will be 1/3.

112
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,400
To find debt beta of the new firm, we will use the CAPM.

113
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,510
Recall that the cost of debt of the new firm will be 8%.

114
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,240
Given the risk-free rate of 5% and the return

115
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,760
on the market portfolio of 15%, we

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,410
find that debt beta of the new firm will be 0.3.

117
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,350
Having found debt-to-equity ratio and debt beta,

118
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,180
we can finally find equity beta of the new firm.

119
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,070
We find that it equals 0.967.

120
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,100
To find the expected return on equity of the new firm,

121
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,220
we will use the CAPM.

122
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,220
This slide shows that the expected return will be 14.67%.

123
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,000
