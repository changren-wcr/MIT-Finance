00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,020
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,870
learn how to estimate a weighted average cost of capital

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,810
for a firm in a situation when the firm does not

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,670
pay corporate income tax.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,830
Recall that this is one of the assumptions

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,620
in the Modigliani-Miller theorem.

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,620
Later in the course, we will relax this assumption.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,960
Suppose that you work as an equity analyst

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,645
at an investment bank.

10
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:24,770
You need to find a weighted average cost of capital

11
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,910
for a firm, which you will use in your valuation model.

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,780
You found the following information for this firm.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,360
It is financed with equal amount of debt and equity.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,070
In other words, its debt-to-equity ratio is 1.

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,250
Its cost of debt is 3.5%.

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,370
You have also estimated equity beta of this firm

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,550
and found that it equals to 1.2.

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,220
The economic forecasting division of your bank

19
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,580
advises you to use the market risk premium of 6%

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,490
and the risk-free rate of 2% in your model.

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,550
Suppose that the assumptions of the Modigliani-Miller theorem

22
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,750
hold.

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,209
In particular, assume that corporations do not

24
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,220
pay corporate income taxes.

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,950
What is the weighted average cost of capital of this firm?

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,760
Let's start with the definition of the Weighted Average

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,880
Cost of Capital or WACC.

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,190
It equals to the fraction of debt in the firm's capital

29
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,040
structure multiplied by the cost of debt

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,040
plus the fraction of equity in the firm's capital structure

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,110
multiplied by the cost of equity.

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,320
The fraction of debt is measured by the ratio of debt

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,500
to firm value, which is the sum of debt and equity.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,710
And the fraction of equity is measured by the ratio of equity

35
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,300
to firm value.

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,240
We know that debt-to-equity ratio equals to 1.

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,960
And we know that cost of debt equals to 3.5%.

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,330
Therefore, in order to find WACC,

39
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,880
we need to find the cost of equity.

40
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,000
To find the cost of equity, we will use the capital asset

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,560
pricing model.

42
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,900
Recall that you were advised by your colleagues

43
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,910
in the economic forecasting department

44
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,060
to use the risk-free rate of 2% and the market risk

45
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,290
premium of 6%.

46
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,190
Recall also that you have estimated equity beta

47
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,490
and found that it equals 1.2.

48
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:15,280
These inputs imply that the cost of equity of this firm is 9.2%.

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,250
As a final step, we need to find the fraction of debt

50
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,950
and the fraction of equity in the firm's capital structure.

51
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,280
In other words, we need to find the ratio of debt

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,010
to debt plus equity and the ratio of equity

53
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,010
to debt plus equity.

54
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,830
Recall that we are given only debt-to-equity ratio.

55
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,160
Let's rearrange debt to debt plus equity ratio.

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,820
First, divide the numerator and the denominator

57
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,930
by D. We get 1 divided by the sum of 1

58
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,060
plus equity-to-debt ratio.

59
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,970
Second, flip equity-to-debt ratio,

60
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,630
and write it as 1 divided by debt-to-equity ratio.

61
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,420
We know that debt-to-equity ratio equals to 1.

62
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,230
Hence, the debt-to-debt plus equity ratio

63
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,350
equals to 1 divided by 1 plus 1 divided

64
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,500
by 1, which equals to 1/2.

65
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,390
This means that the fraction of debt in this firm is 50%.

66
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,580
This should not surprise us.

67
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,760
If this firm is equally financed with debt and equity,

68
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,830
then the fraction of debt in this firm

69
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,560
has to be equal to 50%.

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,720
Same holds for the fraction of equity.

71
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
It equals to 50% as well.

72
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,020
Putting this all together, we can compute the WACC.

73
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,010
It equals to the fraction of debt,

74
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,760
which is 1/2, times the cost of debt, which

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,920
is 3.5%, plus the fraction of equity, which is also 1/2,

76
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,210
times the cost of equity, which is 9.2%.

77
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,740
This gives us the WACC of 6.35%.

78
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,000
