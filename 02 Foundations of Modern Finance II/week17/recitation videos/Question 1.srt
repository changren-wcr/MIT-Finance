00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:01,440
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,960
consider corporate financial transaction known

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,660
as leveraged recapitalization and we

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,870
will determine its impact on equity of the firm.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,660
Teradyne is automatic test equipment designer

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,079
and manufacturer located in Boston, Massachusetts.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,030
It is currently an all-equity firm

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,000
with an expected return of 12%.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,970
It is considering a leveraged recapitalization

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,510
in which it would borrow and repurchase existing shares.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,460
Suppose Teradyne borrows to the point

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,790
that its debt-equity ratio is 0.5.

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,110
With this amount of debt, the debt cost of capital is 6%.

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,760
What will the expected return on equity

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,770
be after this transaction?

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,080
To answer this question, first, note

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,200
that since Teradyne is currently all-equity firm,

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,350
it's expected return on equity and assets are the same,

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,960
and both equal to 12%.

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,360
Second, recall the Modigliani-Miller proposition

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,030
II, which states that return on equity

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,960
equals the return on assets plus debt equity ratio multiplied

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,420
by the difference between the expected return on assets

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,470
and debt.

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,190
Recall that the return on assets of Teradyne is 12%.

26
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,500
Under the proposed capitalization plan,

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,510
the debt equity ratio is 0.5 and the cost of debt is 6%.

28
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,170
This gives us the return on equity of 15%.

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,060
Therefore, if there Teradyne proceeds

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,070
with this leverage recapitalization plan,

31
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,390
its expected return on equity will increase from 12% to 15%.

32
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,940
Suppose instead, Teradyne borrows to the point

33
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,730
that its debt-equity ratio is 1.5.

34
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,860
With this amount of debt, Teradyne's debt

35
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,630
will be much riskier.

36
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,810
As a result, the debt cost of capital will be 8%.

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,670
What will the expected return on equity be in this case?

38
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,800
Using the Modigliani-Miller proposition II

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,660
with debt equity ratio of 1.5 and cost of debt of 8%,

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,208
we obtained the new expected return on equity, which is 18%.

41
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,750
We see that the higher amount of debt

42
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,030
increases the expected return on equity of Teradyne.

43
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,970
One of senior managers argues that option B

44
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,039
is in the best interest of shareholders

45
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,760
because it leads to high expected return on the stock.

46
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,690
How would you respond to this argument?

47
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,410
Your response should point out that option B leads

48
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,330
to high expected return on equity

49
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,650
because under larger debt load, equity becomes riskier.

50
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,590
Returns are higher because the risk is higher.

51
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,740
The higher return simply compensates our shareholders

52
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,580
for this additional risk.

53
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,520
In other words, there is no free lunch.

54
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,660
If our shareholders want to obtain higher expected return,

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,450
they can do so themselves through transactions

56
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,500
in the financial market.

57
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,000
