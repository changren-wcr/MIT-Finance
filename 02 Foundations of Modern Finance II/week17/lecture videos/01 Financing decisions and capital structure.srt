00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,810
PROFESSOR: So far, we have focused on the valuation

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,080
of assets, financial or real.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,710
In particular, in the corporate finance context

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,100
we have applied the general asset valuation methodology

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,180
using market prices to the valuation of real assets

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,990
or investments.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:25,080
This is about the question of what projects to invest in.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,510
What we want to consider next is how

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,410
a firm makes its financing, payout, and risk management

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,310
decisions.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,110
We examine these decisions one at a time.

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,860
We first consider a firm's financing decisions,

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,560
namely how to meet the firm's funding needs.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,840
We will start out by taking investment decisions as given,

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,320
and focusing on how to fund them.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,060
Later in lecture 19 we will further consider situations

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,280
in which investment and financing

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,379
decisions are connected and how to make them jointly.

19
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,970
Given a firm's funding needs, determined by its investment

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:14,610
decisions, there are often multiple funding sources.

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,850
They include internal funds like cash, debt by borrowing,

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,160
equity by issuing stocks, other financial claims like warrants,

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,170
convertibles, and so on.

24
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,660
The question is, what is the best source of funds?

25
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,010
In addition, even within each type of funding source

26
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,980
there are a rich set of choices.

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,590
For internal funds, for example, we

28
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,510
can choose between cash reserves versus cutting dividends.

29
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,620
For debt we can choose between bank loans versus bonds.

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:03,650
For equity there's VCs versus IPO, PE versus SEO, and so on.

31
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,660
In general, we refer to how a firm's assets

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,910
are financed or funded as its capital structure.

33
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,300
It represents the set of financial claims

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,790
against the firm's assets or cash flows,

35
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,110
which is the liability side of the balance sheet.

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,520
These claims typically differ in their financial

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,450
characteristics, such as pay off structure,

38
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,860
like fixed promise versus discretionary payments;

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,990
priority, like debt paid before equity; maturity, for example,

40
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,900
long versus short term debt; covenants, voting and control

41
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,490
rights, options, and so on.

42
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,070
We will start with the simplest and most basic claims, debt

43
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,230
and equity.

44
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,760
The mix of debt and equity is also referred to as leverage.

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,250
No leverage means no debt.

46
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,800
And higher leverage means more debt

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,510
relative to equity or total capital.

48
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,080
Therefore, the basic question we're interested in

49
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,710
is, is there an optimal capital structure

50
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:27,120
or mix of debt and equity given the firm's assets?

51
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,010
More generally, the question is, can we add value to the firm

52
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,710
by following a good financing policy,

53
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:40,430
or choosing the right hand side of the balance sheet?

54
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,880
If the answer is yes, the next question

55
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,960
is, what determines this optimal financing policy, and how?

56
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,450
In this course, we will mainly focus

57
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,080
on leverage, or the choice between debt and equity,

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,180
and how it affects the firm's value.
