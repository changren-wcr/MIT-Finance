1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,720
PROFESSOR: We now start our analysis on capital structure.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,920
The game plan is as follows.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,850
First, we'll start with the simple situation

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,750
when there are no frictions in the financial market.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,120
Under these ideal conditions, we will

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,210
find that capital structure is irrelevant.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,560
That is, given the SSI of a firm's balance sheet,

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,230
choices on the right-hand side of the balance sheet

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,260
does not change the firm's value.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,759
This is the well-known Modigliani-Miller theorem.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,700
We will then incorporate different types of frictions

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,960
into the analysis and see how they may influence a firm's

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,910
capital structure choices.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,860
These frictions include taxes, cost of financial distress

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,850
when there's debt, other frictions in a financial market

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,140
such as transaction costs, asymmetric information, agency

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,140
costs, and so on.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,850
In general, capital structure is no longer irrelevant

19
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,310
when there are frictions.

20
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,280
Finally, we will put the different pieces together

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,430
to arrive at a more comprehensive perspective

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,250
on capital structure choices.

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,090
We focus on 1 in this lecture, and we turn to 2 and 3 later.

24
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,720
Let us consider the world without frictions.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,970
In particular, we'll assume the following.

26
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,060
First, a complete financial market,

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,080
which means that we have a rich set of traded securities

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,150
in a market; second, an information-efficient market

29
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,840
and no information asymmetry; three, no taxes;

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,640
four, no transaction and bankruptcy costs; five,

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,000
hold constant the firm's investment or asset.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,030
Under the assumptions above, we have

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,960
the Modigliani-Miller irrelevance theorem.

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,700
First, financing decisions are irrelevant for a firm's value.

35
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,120
Second, in particular, the choice of capital structure

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,810
is irrelevant.

37
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,560
As we will see, the first part of the MM theorem

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,310
is quite general.

39
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,360
The second part is a specific corollary

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,740
of the irrelevance theorem for capital structure.

41
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,700
It is sometimes also referred to as the MM theorem 1.

42
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,180
What we want to do next is to provide

43
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,660
a more formal proof of MM 1.

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,040
The purpose of this is not for mathematical exercise,

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,820
but to gain deeper understanding of the profound insight of MM.

46
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,390
For convenience, let's introduce some notation.

47
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:02,560
Let V denote the value of a firm's asset or a project's.

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,590
Let D denote the value of its debt;

49
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,970
E denote the value of its equity.

50
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,210
All values are in market values.

51
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:20,450
Let rA, rD, and rE denote the required rates of return

52
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,690
on the firm's asset, debt, and equity respectively.

53
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,770
Furthermore, let CFA denote the total payoff

54
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,230
from the firm's asset.

55
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,870
CFD and CFE denote the payoff to the firm's debt and equity

56
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,160
respectively.

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,920
Then we have CFD plus CFE equals CFA.

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,500
That is, the payoffs to debt and equity must sum to the payoff

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,210
to the firm's asset.

60
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,270
Since the firm's asset is held constant,

61
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,920
all its payoff must be paid out either to debt holders

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,190
or to equity holders.

63
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,940
By no arbitrage, we'll have the following--

64
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,100
the present value of the cash flow

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,730
to debt plus the present value of the cash flow to equity

66
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,500
must equal to the present value of the cash flow to the asset,

67
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,240
or D plus E equals A.

68
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,340
We then have the following conclusions.

69
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,830
First, a firm's value is determined by the total cash

70
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,540
flow of its asset.

71
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,780
Second, capital structure only determines

72
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,740
how the total cash flow is distributed between debt

73
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,640
and equity holders.

74
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,910
Given its asset, a firm's capital structure

75
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,750
won't influence its total market value.

76
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,600
The idea behind the MM theorem can also

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,180
be shown more intuitively as follows.

78
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,680
If the firm's asset is fixed, the total size of the pie,

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,310
so to speak-- that is, its cash flow--

80
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,880
is also fixed.

81
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,450
The capital structure is only about how to slice up

82
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,000
this pie into two pieces--

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,710
payoffs to debt and equity respectively.

84
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,740
How to slice the pie clearly won't change

85
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,230
the total size of the pie.

86
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,600
In the absence of frictions, slicing incurs no costs.

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,350
Therefore, it won't change the total value of the pie,

88
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,850
that is, the value of the asset, which is held constant.

89
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:42,860
This is sometimes also referred to as "the Pie Theory of MM."

90
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,910
What if slicing changes the total size of the pie?

91
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,120
Then there will be an arbitrage.

92
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,110
Let's think about this.

93
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,780
Suppose that by dividing up the firm's asset into debt

94
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,890
and equity, the sum of the value of debt and equity

95
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,550
is higher than the value of the asset.

96
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,240
Well, we can then buy up an asset, issue debt and equity

97
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,050
against it, yielding more than what we paid.

98
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,880
This is an arbitrage.

99
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,390
If instead a levered firm's debt and equity

100
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,750
are trading at prices that sum to be lower

101
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,010
than the value of its asset, we can then

102
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,260
buy up the debt and equity and then

103
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,910
form an unlevered firm, which is simply the firm's asset,

104
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,940
and sell it for more than the cost.

105
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,770
This is again an arbitrage.

106
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,350


107
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,800
Therefore, in the absence of any frictions,

108
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,700
slicing a pie, that is, changing the firm's financing or capital

109
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,760
structure, is a zero NPV activity.

110
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,590
It does not create value.
