1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,640
PROFESSOR: We will start our analysis

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,850
by looking at some data on a firm's capital structure

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,850
choices.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,020
These data not only tell us about some facts on the ground,

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,620
but also provide valuable empirical guidance

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,750
to our analysis.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,130
The figure on the slide shows the average leverage level

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,680
of major US firms.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,930
The time span is from 1970 to 2019

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,510
as represented by the x-axis.

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,090
The y-axis shows the average leverage ratio,

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,320
which is defined here by the ratio of debt

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,620
to asset, which equals debt plus equity.

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,960
The blue bars show the debt to asset ratio using their book

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,950
values.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,950
And the red bars show the ratio using market values.

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,190
In terms of book value, the leverage level

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,840
is fairly stable.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,129
It moves around 50%.

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,550
There's a substantial rise in the average leverage

21
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,210
level after 2008 financial crisis,

22
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,930
but the trend is reversed in 2019.

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,320
In terms of market value, the leverage level

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,380
is lower and more variable.

25
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:28,330
It fluctuates between 25% and 50% during this time period.

26
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,210
Looking more closely, we also notice

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,640
that during the years of rising stock

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:41,620
market, such as in the 1990s, 2000s, and after 2016,

29
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,080
the market leverage level decreases,

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,770
mostly due to the rise in equity value.

31
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,410
In the years of large stock market declines,

32
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:59,000
such as 1990, 2001, and 2008, the market leverage level

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,940
spikes up substantially.

34
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,820
But on average, especially over the recent decades,

35
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,979
the market leverage ratio is mostly around 30%.

36
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,280
What is shown on this slide is how much

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,340
firms rely on different sources of funds.

38
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,920
The time span is from 1979 to 1997, shown

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,000
by the x-axis in the figure.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,550
The y-axis shows the percentage of new financing from three

41
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,530
major funding sources--

42
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,170
internal funds, debt issuance, and equity issuance for US

43
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,330
companies during this period.

44
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,760
The black bars show the percentage

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,070
of internal financing.

46
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,090
It ranges from 60% to above 80%.

47
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,450
Clearly, internal funds are the major source

48
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,940
of financing for most firms.

49
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,110
The purple bars represent the percentage of debt financing.

50
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,500
It varies from 10% to 40% roughly, depending on the year.

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,250
Equity financing is given by the gray bars.

52
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,810
It actually fluctuates around zero, ranging from minus 20%

53
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,230
to a few positive percentage points.

54
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,200
Here, negative equity financing simply

55
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,490
means that firms are buying back their shares, returning money

56
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,750
to the shareholders.

57
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,830
From this figure, we make the following observations.

58
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:41,770
Firms rely mostly on internal funds for investments.

59
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,970
When external funds are needed, they rely more on debt

60
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,500
than equity.

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,650
In particular, firms do not rely on equity

62
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,930
as a main source of external financing.

63
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,020
Although the sample shown in the figure

64
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,870
is a bit short and not up to date,

65
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,390
but the general pattern as outlined above is quite robust.

66
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,510
This pattern in firms' financing choices

67
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,920
is sometimes also referred to as the pecking order theory.

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,430
It is an interesting fact to keep in mind.

69
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,250
We will return later to discuss a bit more

70
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,560
about the possible reasons for such a phenomenon.

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,060
The data before shows the average leverage level

72
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,780
and funding patterns across all firms.

73
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,230
What we will consider next is the variation

74
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,090
in firms' leverage across different industries.

75
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,300
The table on the slide shows the capital structure

76
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,830
for a subset of industries in the US at the end of 2019.

77
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,850
The first column lists several major industries.

78
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,990
And the second column gives their market leverage level.

79
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,130
That is the debt to capital or asset ratio

80
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,880
in percentage terms.

81
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,450
The first industry in the table is telecom equipment,

82
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,850
shown in the second row.

83
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,340
The market leverage level for this industry

84
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,040
is 46%, which is on the high side.

85
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,660
Going down the list, we have coal and related energy,

86
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,760
chemicals (basic), food processing, paper and forest

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,100
products.

88
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,780
Their market leverage levels are all

89
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,020
in the 30s in percentage terms.

90
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,040
The next group is general retailers

91
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,110
and software, internet.

92
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,130
Their leverage level is in the teens.

93
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,860
The largest industry in the table

94
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,810
is software, entertainment.

95
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,690
Its leverage level is 1%.

96
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,940
That is, for this industry, there's

97
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,730
practically no leverage at all.

98
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,620


99
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,760
The last row in the table gives the average leverage

100
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,880
level across all industries, excluding

101
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,620
the financial industry due to its very high leverage level.

102
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,780
This average is 38% as we have seen before.

103
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,900
The data from the table clearly tells us

104
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,330
that leverage can be quite different

105
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,670
across different industries.

106
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,210
Naturally, we would like to understand why.

107
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,490
Our analysis on capital structure

108
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,830
should help us with this.

109
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,060
Before we move on, it's also helpful to briefly review

110
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,310
the return and the risk characteristics

111
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,560
of corporate debt and equity, which

112
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,250
we have examined in more detail in part one of this course.

113
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,060
The table on the slide lists the return and the risk

114
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,080
estimates for the major asset classes in the US

115
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,230
using their historic returns.

116
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,140
We're mostly interested in three of them--

117
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:10,570
long-term corporate debt, large stocks, and small stocks.

118
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,930
Long-term corporate bonds yield an average return

119
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:20,680
of 6.3% per year with a return volatility of 8.4%.

120
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,960
Large stocks yield an average return of 11.9% per year

121
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,680
and a return volatility of 19.8%.

122
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,940
Small stocks have an average return of 16.2%

123
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,680
and return volatility of 31.6% per year.

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,980
Clearly, corporate debt and equity

125
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,460
have significantly different return and risk

126
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,170
characteristics.

127
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,650
In particular, the markets' required rate of return

128
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,830
is much higher on stocks than bonds, for good reason

129
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,500
since stocks are much riskier.

130
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,000
