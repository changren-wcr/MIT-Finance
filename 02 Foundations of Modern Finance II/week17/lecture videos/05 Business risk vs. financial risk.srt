1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,150
PROFESSOR: We want to further explore

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,620
the implication of leverage on the risk of equity.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,770
We have learned that the required rates of return

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,380
on a firm's asset, debt and equity,

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,420
have the following relationship.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,960
That is, rA equals D divided by D plus E times rD plus E

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,770
divided by D plus E times rE.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,500
That's the weighted average of rD and rE

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,110
on the right-hand side.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,310
Rewriting this, we have the second MM theorem.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,620
The cost of equity of a levered firm

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,320
is given by the following equation--

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,790
rE equals rA plus D/E--

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,290
that's the debt-to-equity ratio-- times rA minus rD.

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,880
From this equation, we make the following observations.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,980
The required rate of return on asset,

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,540
rA, is independent of D/E, the debt-to-equity ratio,

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,290
which also measures leverage.

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,400
rE increases with the debt-to-equity ratio

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,880
if debt is risk-free.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,000
Equity becomes riskier, hence demands

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,760
a higher expected rate of return when

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,970
financial leverage increases.

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,570
rD may also increase with leverage,

25
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,860
as debt becomes risky.

26
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,120
What we want to do next is to understand a little better how

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,040
leverage changes a firm's risk.

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,130
The risk associated with a firm's asset

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,280
is referred to as its business risk,

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,170
which arises from the firm's real business activities.

31
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,970
When the firm's asset is kept constant, as we do now,

32
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,450
its business risk is also fixed.

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,590
Changes in risk only occurs for the different parts

34
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,510
on the liability side--

35
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,610
that is, equity and debt--

36
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,670
when we change leverage.

37
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,590
To see this, let's consider two firms labeled as U and L.

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,270
In particular, the two firms have the same assets.

39
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,020
Firm U is 100% equity-financed, that is, unlevered.

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,010
Firm L is financed by both equity and debt,

41
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,560
hence it's levered.

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,200
From MM II, we have the following.

43
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,420
First, Firm L's required rate of return on equity

44
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,570
is different from Firm U's. The required rate of return

45
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,040
of Firm U's equity compensates for its business risk,

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,500
that is, the risk of its asset.

47
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,390
However, for Firm L's equity, in addition to the firm's business

48
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,020
risk, it also involves an additional financial risk,

49
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,070
which arises from leverage.

50
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,380
Therefore, the difference between the required rates

51
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,780
of return on equity for Firm L and U

52
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,720
compensates for the financial risk in Firm L's equity.

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,690
In order to further illustrate the financial risk

54
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,980
in the firm's equity.

55
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,240
Let's assume that the CAPM holds.

56
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,390
Furthermore, we assume that the firm's leverage level is low

57
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,710
so that its debt is risk-free.

58
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,030
Using the market beta as the measure of systematic risk,

59
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,250
we have the following relationship--

60
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,950
beta A-- that's the beta of the asset--

61
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:48,790
equals wD, the weight of debt, times beta D plus 1 minus wD--

62
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,440
that gives the weight of equity--

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,410
times beta E. And that equals 1 minus wD times beta

64
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,500
E when beta of debt is 0.

65
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,300
We can also rewrite this as the beta E equals 1 over 1

66
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,240
minus wD times beta A.

67
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,960
From this equation, we observe the following.

68
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,700
Beta A captures the risk of the firm's asset or business, which

69
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,680
is independent of its financing.

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,970
Beta E minus beta A is in general different from 0.

71
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,540
This difference does depend on the firm's financing,

72
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,270
reflecting its equity's financial risk.

73
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,140
If D equals 0, that is, when there's no leverage,

74
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,350
then beta E equals beta A, and equity has no financial risk.

75
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,030
However, for D greater than 0, that is,

76
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,500
when there is leverage, we have beta E greater than beta A

77
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,830
when beta A is positive.

78
00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:00,540
This is also true even when beta D is not 0 but small.

79
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,240
For beta D equals 0, that is, when debt is risk-free,

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,090
we can also rewrite the following.

81
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,580
Beta E equals 1 plus D/E, the debt-to-equity ratio,

82
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:21,510
times beta A. Clearly, beta E increases with D/E.

83
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,600
The discussion above tells us the following--

84
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,040
firms with similar businesses can have very different equity

85
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,040
betas when they have different capital structures.

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,320
The discussion above also leads to

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,640
other important implications, in particular in capital budgeting

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,720
analysis.

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,890
In absence of taxes, only the required rate

90
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,630
of return on asset or project is needed in capital budgeting

91
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,010
decisions.

92
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,770
As we discussed above, we typically

93
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,940
try to obtain this discount rate from traded assets

94
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,010
in the market with similar risks,

95
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,890
in particular, similar systematic risks.

96
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,420
We do so as follows.

97
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:14,270
First, we find traded firms with comparable asset or business.

98
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,950
Next we use the equity returns as asset returns

99
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,490
to estimate the asset's systematic risk level,

100
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,390
like the beta in the CAPM, if these firms

101
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,460
are 100% equity-financed.

102
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,590
In this case, equity equals asset.

103
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,230
However, this may not always happen.

104
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,870
In particular, trade firms may not be 100% equity-financed.

105
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,460
When there's leverage, we cannot naively use the return

106
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,970
on equity to approximate the return on asset.

107
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,120
Instead, we need to unlever the equity return

108
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,910
to obtain asset return.

109
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,490
We develop this procedure using an example.

110
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,660
Suppose that we want to obtain the cost of capital

111
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,350
for a privately held software business.

112
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,560
There are two publicly traded software companies

113
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,470
who have similar business risks as the one we

114
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,130
are interested in.

115
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,470
However, these two firms are financed differently.

116
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,650
Their capital structure and related information

117
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,190
are given in the table.

118
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:32,210
Firm 1 has an equity beta of 1.42, debt beta of 0.24,

119
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,310
and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5, which are given

120
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,820
by the second row in the table.

121
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:48,260
Firm 2 has an equity beta of 1.56, debt beta of 0.57,

122
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,605
and a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.2,

123
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:55,950
which are given by the third row in the table.

124
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,300
Clearly, the equity beta is different for the two firms,

125
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,170
despite the fact that they are in the same line of business

126
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,500
and should have the same asset beta.

127
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,740
This difference arises from the fact

128
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,630
that the two firms have very different leverage levels.

129
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,270
Firm 2 has a debt-to-equity ratio

130
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,860
of 1.2, which is a lot higher than Firm 1's

131
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,740
debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5.

132
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,539
We also notice that both firms' debt are not risk-free

133
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,630
and have positive betas.

134
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,780
Because of higher leverage, Firm 2's debt has a higher beta than

135
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,340
Firm 1's.

136
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,360
What we are interested in, however,

137
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,790
is the asset beta of the two firms, not the equity betas.

138
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,230
Using MM II for the relationship between a firm's

139
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,360
cost of equity, asset, and debt, and assuming the CAPM holds,

140
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,815
we have the following equation for these two firms' betas.

141
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:09,510
For Firm 1, we have on the left-hand side

142
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:15,960
beta E, which is 1.42 for Firm 1 equals on the right-hand side

143
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,990
beta A plus 0.5, which is Firm 1's debt-to-equity ratio,

144
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:29,630
times beta A minus beta D, which is 0.24 for Firm 1.

145
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,300
For Firm 2, we have the same equation

146
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,030
but with Firm 2's numbers.

147
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,650
Beta E on the left-hand side, which is 1.56 for Firm 2,

148
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,770
equals on the right-hand side beta

149
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,660
A plus 1.2, Firm 2's debt-to-equity ratio,

150
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:55,210
times beta A minus 0.57, which is Firm 2's debt beta.

151
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,900
Solving for beta A from the two equations,

152
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:08,005
we have beta A1 equals 1.03 and beta A2 equals 1.02.

153
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:12,740
The two estimates are not identical but quite close.

154
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,380
This makes sense, since the two companies are

155
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,580
in the same business and should have similar systematic risks

156
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,620
for their assets.

157
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,700
Take the average of the two estimates, and round up,

158
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,050
we have the estimate beta for the asset beta

159
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,160
A, which is 1.03.

160
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,370
Using CAPM with the risk-free rate of 4%

161
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,340
and a market premium of 8%, the cost

162
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,740
of capital for the software business

163
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,830
should be 4%, the risk-free rate, plus 1.03, the asset

164
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:56,900
beta, times 8%, the market premium, which gives 12.24%.

165
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,000
