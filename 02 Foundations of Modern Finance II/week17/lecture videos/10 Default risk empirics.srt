1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,450
PROFESSOR: For the last part of our discussion on default

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,160
risks, let's take a look at some data

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,820
to get a better empirical perspective.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,670
What is shown in the figure on the slide

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,250
is the time series of the promise

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,270
yields on corporate bonds with different ratings.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:26,950
The x-axis is time from 1920 to June of 2020.

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,210
The y-axis gives the promised yield to maturity.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,900
The blue line gives the yield for Moody's AAA

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,040
corporate bonds.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,000
And the red line is for BAA bonds.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,620
The shaded intervals are times of economic recessions.

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,920
The overall time trend for the two yields

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,430
are mostly driven by the changes in interest rates,

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,000
as we have seen in our fixed income discussion in part

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,150
one of this course.

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,930
Our interest is on the difference or the spread

18
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,100
between the two yields, namely the vertical distance

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,990
between the two curves.

20
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,160
Given that AAA bonds are almost risk-free,

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,540
this yield spread roughly reflects the default premium

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,080
of BAA bonds.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,330
We make two observations.

24
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,050
First, the yield spread does change over time.

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,190
Sometimes it's quite small, less than one percentage point.

26
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,650
And sometimes it's quite large, more

27
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,330
than several percentage points.

28
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,470
This simply implies that the probability of default

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,140
and the recovery rate can both be

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,360
varying over time as the state of the economy evolves.

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,260
Second, during periods of economic recession,

32
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,100
the yield spread tends to widen, also

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,590
reflecting potential increases in default risk and loss ratio.

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,220
These results, although not unexpected,

35
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,550
do reflect how the market behaves

36
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,650
in pricing corporate bonds.

37
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,880
Next, we consider corporate bonds default probabilities.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,690
For this, we use the historic data on defaults.

39
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,180
What's plotted in the figure on the slide

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,230
is the historic default rates for corporate bonds globally.

41
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,530
The x-axis is time from 1920 to 2017.

42
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:44,240
The y-axis is the percentage of bonds defaulted in each year.

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,660
The light blue line is for all corporate bonds.

44
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,120
And the dark blue line is for speculative grade bonds.

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,390
From the data, we make several observations.

46
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,420
First, bonds of speculative grade

47
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,260
tend to have higher default rates on average.

48
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,180
This also means that the ratings are informative about bonds'

49
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,570
default risks.

50
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,810
Also, the average rate of default for all bonds

51
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,630
is below 4%, while the average rate

52
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:22,620
of default for speculative bonds can be substantially higher.

53
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,400
Second, the default rates are not constant over time.

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,680
There are large time variations.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,410
In the good years, the default rates

56
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,600
can be close to zero, even for junk bonds.

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,710
In the bad years, the default rate for speculative bonds

58
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:46,000
can be 6% or higher, sometimes even reaching double digits.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,430
This is an important fact.

60
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,550
It suggests that default risk has

61
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,920
systematic components in it.

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,750
In other words, defaults are correlated across bonds.

63
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,120
This should not be surprising.

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,700
In good economic times, we expect the default rates

65
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,550
to be lower for all bonds.

66
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,550
In bad times, we expect the opposite.

67
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,700
If default risk was all idiosyncratic,

68
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,950
we would expect the average default rate

69
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,040
to be flat over time.

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,520
The plot on this site shows similar results,

71
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,730
that is, global default rates for all bonds--

72
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,400
investment grade bonds and speculative grade bonds.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,230
The time span here is 1981 to 2019.

74
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,230
The dark blue line at the bottom gives the default

75
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,640
rates for investment grade bonds during this period.

76
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,230
Clearly, the default rates are generally very low.

77
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,440
The yellow line at the top shows the default rates

78
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,320
for junk grade bonds.

79
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,830
They are a lot higher than that of investment grade bonds.

80
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,530
More importantly, the default rates

81
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,670
vary substantially over time.

82
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,080
In particular, during periods of recession and stock market

83
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,945
correction, such as 1991, 2000, 2001, 2008,

84
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:19,310
and '09, the default rates really spike up.

85
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,520
This clearly demonstrates the systematic nature

86
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,870
of default risks.

87
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,790
The light blue line in the middle

88
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,670
gives the default rates of all bonds, which

89
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,980
is the average between investment

90
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,010
and speculative grade bonds.

91
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,890
Summarizing what the data reveals,

92
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,890
we have the following results on factors

93
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,900
affecting default risks.

94
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,410
First, most of default risks, as measured by default

95
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,020
probability, is idiosyncratic.

96
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,210
Second, a substantial part of the default risk is systematic.

97
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,670
That is correlated across bonds.

98
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,220
The systematic part of the default risk

99
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,540
is also related, at least partially to economic cycles.

100
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,810
Third, the systematic part of the default risk

101
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,750
may also exhibit fat tails.

102
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,900
How about recovery rates?

103
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,790
They seem to exhibit similar properties

104
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,580
as the default rates.
