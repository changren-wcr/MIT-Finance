00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,900
PROFESSOR: Let's now gather the results

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,830
we have obtained from Modigliani Miller.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,000
The key insight is that a firm's value is primarily

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,700
determined by its assets.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,720
That is, by its real investments.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,200
Holding the asset constant, financial transactions

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,250
such as the choice of financing do not change the firm's value.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,700
Although the MM theorem was originally

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,170
aimed at firms' financing or capital structure choices,

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,040
this insight it reveals actually applies to all aspects

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,660
of financial policy.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,870
In particular, in the absence of frictions

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,700
in the financial market, we have the following MM irrelevance

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,300
results.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,460
Capital structure is irrelevant.

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,500
Long-term versus short-term debt is irrelevant.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,590
Payout policy is irrelevant.

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,540
Risk management policy is irrelevant.

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,680
And so on.

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,030
Generally speaking, holding the asset side fixed,

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,600
financial transactions involving the liability side

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,020
are all zero NPV activities, since they're all

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,120
properly priced by the market.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,600
The MM insight is a powerful one,

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,740
but it holds only under its assumptions, which leave out

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,990
important aspects of reality.

27
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,680
It is the starting point of modern corporate finance, not

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,930
the end.

29
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,900
It helps us to avoid some potential misconceptions

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,530
and confusions, like the cheap debt fallacy,

31
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,140
but more importantly, it guides us

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,460
to ask the right questions, such as true reasons for capital

33
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,170
structure to matter.

34
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,800
For example, in the case of financing,

35
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,960
how the choice of capital structure

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,440
may change the total size of this pie--

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,040
that is, the total value of the firm in the presence

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,900
of various frictions.

39
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,140
We will extend analysis of financing

40
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,960
to these situations in the following lectures.

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,850
But before doing so, we would like

42
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,910
to spend the rest of this lecture to examine

43
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,960
the risk of corporate debt.
