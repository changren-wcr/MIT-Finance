00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,970
PROFESSOR: Since a firm's liabilities are really

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,500
claims on its asset, we can also view a firm

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,620
as the portfolio of financial claims.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,350
Using portfolio analytics, we have A equals D plus E.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,560
That is, a firm as a portfolio consists

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,810
of its debt and equity.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,730
Second, the rates of return on the firm's asset, debt,

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,120
and equity satisfy the following equation--

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,080
rA equals D divided by D plus E--

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,690
that's the relative weight of debt--

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,650
times rD plus E divided by D plus C--

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,570
that's the relative weight of equity--

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,300
times rE.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,040
The same equation also holds for the required rates of return

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,060
on asset, debt, and equity.

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,240
A firm's cost of capital is the required rate

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,540
of return on its asset, rA.

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,540
Similarly, the firm's cost of debt and equity

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,530
are the required rates of return on its debt and equity,

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,350
given by rD and rE respectively.

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,770
From the equation above, we have the following.

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,960
A firm's cost of capital rA also equals the weighted average

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,520
of its cost of debt, rD, and its cost of equity, rE.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,590
We therefore conclude-- when a firm is financed by both debt

25
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,010
and equity, its cost of capital rA

26
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:42,590
equals the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, also known as WACC,

27
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,820
which is given by the last equation on the slide.

28
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:53,480
That is, WACC equals D divided by D plus E times rD plus E

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,810
divided by D plus E times rE.

30
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,880
And that equals the relative weight

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,620
of debt times the return on debt plus the relative weight

32
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,170
of equity times return on equity.

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,760
The MM theorem and analysis above, although simple,

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
is fundamental.

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,060
It can help us to avoid various misunderstandings and fallacies

36
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,820
in thinking about financing.

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,410
As an example, let's consider the cheap debt fallacy.

38
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,730
The argument is that debt is a better source of financing,

39
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,030
because it is cheaper than equity.

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,020
Here are the reasons.

41
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,020
First, debt is safer than equity.

42
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,500
Therefore, investors demand a lower return

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,690
for holding debt than equity.

44
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,620
That is, rD is less than rE.

45
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,530
The average difference in the expected returns

46
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,700
is substantial--

47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,110
6% versus 12%, as we have seen before.

48
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,180
Therefore, companies should always

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,520
use debt to finance their assets,

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,600
as they pay lower returns on their debt.

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,170
Is this argument correct?

52
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,610
Let's think it over.

53
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,930
It is true that debt demands a lower return.

54
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,760
But using debt is not free.

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,130
It has hidden costs.

56
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,820
In particular, using more debt will make the existing equity

57
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,110
riskier.

58
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,880
Here's how.

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,110
Given the firm's investments, rA is fixed from the WACC formula,

60
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,480
increasing wD, that is leverage, tends to increasing rE.

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,820
This is unrelated to default risk.

62
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,750
It is true even if the debt remains risk-free.

63
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,120
We can demonstrate this point by an example.

64
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,690
Assume that CAPM holds.

65
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:01,250
Suppose that beta D is 0, that is, the debt is risk-free.

66
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,170
We then have beta A equals wD times

67
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:14,640
beta D plus 1 minus wD times beta E. If beta D is 0,

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,180
then that should equal to 1 minus wD times beta E.

69
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,580
Rewriting this equation, we have beta E equals 1 over 1

70
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:33,680
minus wD times beta A. Given A, the asset, beta A is fixed.

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,290
Increasing wD will then increase beta E. From this analysis,

72
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,955
we see that as we sell more of the safer cash flow to debt

73
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:47,180
holders, the remaining cash flow,

74
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,240
which goes to equity holders, becomes riskier.

75
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,620
Here we need to distinguish two meanings of "cheap."

76
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,760
One is "low cost," which may also imply low benefit.

77
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,160
The other is "good deal."

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,510
Clearly, in absence of market frictions, increasing leverage

79
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,500
itself is not a good deal.

80
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,000
