00:00:00,807 --> 00:00:02,390
PROFESSOR: In our previous discussion,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,390
we have learned that taking on debt

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,380
will usually increase the risk of a firm's equity.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,510
How about the risk of debt?

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,830
Sometimes, in a discussion, for simplicity, we

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,030
assume that debt is risk-free.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,940
Of course, in general, it's not.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,120
Here, we will examine the risk of corporate debt

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,860
in more detail.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,410
Corporate debt yields promised payoffs

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,230
of fixed amount at fixed times.

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,430
For this reason, it is often put in the fixed income category.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,800
But it's important to recognize that promises are promises.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,220
Unlike government debt, at least the good ones,

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,370
corporate debt has the risk of unable

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,110
to deliver the promised payoffs.

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,890
This risk is also called the default risk or credit

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,310
risk, which refers to the possibility

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,480
that a corporate debt fails to make the promised

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,350
payment on time, either interest or principal.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,320
It is important to note, in legal terms,

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,880
the definition of default is any failure in delivering promised

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,980
payments on time, independent of how much in amount and in time.

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,110
We will introduce several measures

25
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,940
to characterize default risk.

26
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,200
One gauge of default risk is provided by rating agencies

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,950
in the market.

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,190
Two of the major ones are Moody's and Standard

29
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,510
and Poor's, or S&P. They use a letter rating

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,500
system to indicate the likelihood of default

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,020
for debt securities.

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,890
The table on the slide gives a rough description

33
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,417
of this rating system, the first column

34
00:01:56,417 --> 00:02:01,810
lists the different grades for credit-worthiness

35
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,860
from high to low.

36
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,660
The top is gilt-edged, the highest grade, and the bottom

37
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,729
is low grade.

38
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,530
The second column lists Moody's ratings from high to low.

39
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:23,090
The highest is Aaa, the next is Aa, and single A, and then Baa,

40
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,490
and then Ba, and so on.

41
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,880
The third column is S&P's ratings, AAA, AA, and so on.

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,750
Clearly, the rating scheme between the two agencies

43
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,670
is quite similar.

44
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,770
It is also noted that the rating agencies rate

45
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,720
a wide range of debt instruments issued by firms, governments,

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,200
and various types of entities and financial vehicles.

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800


48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,470
Debt of different ratings is also

49
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,970
given two broad categories.

50
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:06,970
The investment-grade refers to debt of higher ratings, Baa

51
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,660
and above by Moody's or BBB and above by S&P. Speculative

52
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,900
or junk grade refers to debt of lower ratings, Ba

53
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,280
and below by Moody's, and BB and below by S&P. Again,

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,620
these ratings aim at capturing the chance of default, not

55
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,740
its magnitude.
