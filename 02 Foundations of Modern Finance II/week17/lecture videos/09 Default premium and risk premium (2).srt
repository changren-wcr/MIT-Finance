1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,690
PROFESSOR: In the following example,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,290
we explore further the underlying factors

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,390
influencing a bond's default risk premium.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,240
We're looking at Cambridge International Technologies,

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,980
or CIT, which is a company in tech services.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,420
CIT's asset has a market value of $10 billion

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,360
today, which is year 0.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,900
And it will be $15 billion or $5 billion next year, in year 1,

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,790
with probability 2/3 and 1/3, respectively.

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,700
CIT has a one-year zero coupon bond

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,095
outstanding with a par value of $6 billion.

12
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:50,400
The current risk-free rate is 5%.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,240
Clearly, CIT's debt is risky.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,210
In the case of a down state next year,

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,330
its asset value of $5 billion will not

16
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,600
be sufficient to pay off the debt in full,

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,910
which is $6 billion.

18
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,740
We would like to answer the following questions--

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,510
what is the payoff of CIT's bond next year?

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,470
What is the current price of CIT's bond?

21
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,600
What is the current price of CIT's stock?

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,110
What is the promised yield on CIT's bond?

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,360
What is the probability of default?

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,480
And what is the loss rate when default?

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,230
What is the expected yield on CIT's bond?

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,870
What is the default premium on the bond?

27
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,600
And what is the risk premium on the bond?

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,780
Given the information above, we can easily

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,440
write down the payoffs on CIT's asset,

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,620
bond, and equity, which are given

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,600
in the table on the slide.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,780
The second column gives the payoff in the good or up state,

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,060
when asset value goes up.

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,430
And the third column gives the payoff

35
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,780
in the bad or the down state, when asset value goes down.

36
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,530
The payoff of the asset is given in the third row, which

37
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,320
is 15 in the up state and 5 in the down state, which leads

38
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,640
to default. The payoff of the bond

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,540
is in the fourth row, which is 6 in up state

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,320
and 5 in a down state.

41
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,800
The payoff of the stock is in the last row--

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,390
9 in an up state and 0 in a down state.

43
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,450
In order to price the bond and the stock,

44
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,260
we need the state prices, phi u and phi d,

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,230
for the up and down state respectively.

46
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,120
From the price of CIT's asset in the risk-free rate,

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,310
we have the following equations on the slide.

48
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,880
The first equation is for the asset.

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,790
The price of the asset today, which is 10,

50
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,530
equals the sum of its value in the up and down state

51
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,070
multiplied by the corresponding state prices.

52
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,725
This gives 15 times phi u plus 5 times phi

53
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:20,080
d on the right-hand side.

54
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,170
The second equation is for the risk-free asset,

55
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,200
Assuming its payoff is $1 in year 1.

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,930
Its price, which is 1 over 1 plus 0.05

57
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,840
on the left-hand side, equals the sum

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,850
of the two state prices, which gives phi u plus phi d.

59
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,290
Solving for the two equations, we obtain the two state prices.

60
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:54,290
Phi u equals 11/21, and phi d equals 9/21.

61
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,840
With the above information, we can answer

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,940
all the questions listed above.

63
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,400
The current price of the bond and stock

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,130
is simply given by their payoffs in the two

65
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,150
states times the corresponding state prices.

66
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,860
The price of the bond D is given by 6,

67
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,440
which is its payoff in up state, times 11/21,

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,570
the price of the up state, plus 5 times 9/21.

69
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:31,680
That gives 111/21, which is 5.286.

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,460
The price of the stock E is a given by 9,

71
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,080
its payoff in the up state, times 11/21 plus 0,

72
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,460
its payoff in the down state, times 9/21.

73
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:51,870
That equals 99/21, which is 4.714.

74
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,870
These are all in billion dollars.

75
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,150
The promised yield on the bond, that

76
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,140
is, the yield when there's no default, is given by y.

77
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,950
That equals 6, the payoff in the no-default state,

78
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,280
divided by its price minus 1.

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,450
And that gives 6 over 5.286 minus 1.

80
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,900
And that leads to 13.5%.

81
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,730
The probability of default, which

82
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,140
occurs only in the down state, is simply 1/3.

83
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,700
The loss rate lambda is given by 6 minus 5

84
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,200
divided by 6, which is 16.7%.

85
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,870
The expected yield on the bond, y bar, is given by y bar

86
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,330
equals 2/3 times 6 plus 1/3 times 5.

87
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,420
That's the expected payoff on the debt divided

88
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,020
by its price, which is 5.286.

89
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,220
And minus 1, that gives us 7.2%.

90
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,060


91
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,270
The default premium of the bond is

92
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,400
given by the promised yield of 13.5% minus the expected yield

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,170
of 7.2%, which is 6.3%.

94
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,360
The risk premium of the bond is given

95
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,920
by its expected yield of 7.2% minus the risk-free rate

96
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,550
of 5%, which is 2.2%.

97
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,350
This example clearly shows how the price and different yields

98
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,010
of a risky bond are determined by its payoff

99
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,520
in different states, the probabilities of these states,

100
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,730
and the state prices.

101
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,360
Although we have used a simple binomial model

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,240
to illustrate these underlying connections,

103
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,270
as we have seen in the option pricing lecture,

104
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,700
more general binomial models can be

105
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:57,150
built to provide more precise valuations of corporate bonds.
