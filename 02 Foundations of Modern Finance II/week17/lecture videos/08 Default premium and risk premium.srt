1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,430
PROFESSOR: Default risk is also reflected in bond prices.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,810
We use bond prices or yields to define several measures

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,090
of default risk.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,120
We do so by using an example.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,010
For simplicity, we consider only zero coupon bonds

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,390
with a par value of $1,000.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,750
In particular, a 10-year treasury STRIPS

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:34,260
is trading at $463.19, yielding 8%.

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,580
A 10-year zero coupon bond issued by XYZ, Inc.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,940
is trading at $321.97.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,400
Since this bond has the same promised

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,620
payoff at the same time as the 10-year STRIPS,

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,800
the fact that it's trading at a lower price

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,660
simply reflects that it has substantial default risk.

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,060
The payoff from the 10-year STRIPS

16
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,630
is simply $1,000 for sure.

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,020
The payoff from XYZ's 10-year zero, however, is uncertain.

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,500
In the best scenario, it is $1,000.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,240
In the worst scenario, it will be 0.

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,580
Let us assume that the average across all possible scenarios,

21
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:33,780
the expected payoff is $762.22 on the XYZ bond.

22
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,690
We can then define two yields to maturity

23
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,400
to capture XYZ's default risk.

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,610
The first is the promised yield to maturity,

25
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,210
which is defined by the yield to maturity

26
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,490
using the bond's promised payoff and its current price.

27
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,960
It's given by the first equation on the slide.

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,120
Take the promised payoff of $1,000 divided

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,880
by the bond price, which gives the gross return over 10 years.

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,850
Taking the 10th root and minus 1,

31
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,760
we have the promised yield to maturity of 12%.

32
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,310


33
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,910
The second is the expected yield to maturity.

34
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,220
It is defined by the yield to maturity

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,510
using the bond's expected payoff and its current price.

36
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,980
This is given in the second equation on the slide.

37
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,820
The expected yield to maturity equals the expected payoff

38
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,850
of $762.22 divided by the bond's current price, which

39
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:49,470
is $321.97, taking the 10th root and minus 1.

40
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,630
It gives 9%.

41
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,530
Clearly, these two yields differ from the yield to maturity

42
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,170
on the Treasury, which is 8%.

43
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,770
In fact, if we apply the same formulas to the Treasury

44
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,210
STRIPS, we will get 8% for both the promised yield

45
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,630
and the expected yield.

46
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,250
With the two yields defined above,

47
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,840
we can further define two premiums--

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,710
the default premium and the risk premium.

49
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,140
The default premium is given by the difference

50
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,300
between the promised yield to maturity

51
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,040
and expected yield to maturity.

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,240
For XYZ's bond, we have 12%, its promised yield,

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,920
minus 9%, its expected yield, which gives 3%.

54
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,060
Intuitively, this premium reflects the actual yield

55
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:50,020
the bond has to promise to compensate its default risk.

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,750
Risk premium is given by the difference

57
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,790
between expected yield to maturity

58
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,760
and the risk-free yield to maturity.

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:06,120
In the case of XYZ bond, we have 9% minus 8%, which is 1%.

60
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,620
As always, the risk premium is expected excess return

61
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,230
on the bond.

62
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,380
To summarize, we list the four variables

63
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,550
we have introduced to capture different aspects of default

64
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,450
risk.

65
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,880
Promised yield to maturity is the yield

66
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,180
if default does not occur or the promise is met.

67
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,210
Expected yield to maturity is the probability

68
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,410
weighted average of all possible yields.

69
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,560
Default premium is the difference between the promised

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,090
yield and expected yield.

71
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,900
Risk premium is the difference between the expected

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,480
yield on the risky bond and the yield

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,200
of a risk-free bond of similar maturity and coupon rate.

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,740
It's worth noting that the promised yield only

75
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,050
depends on the bond's promised cash

76
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,900
flow and its current price.

77
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,840
Therefore, similar to the yield to maturity

78
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,850
for risk-free bonds, promised yield is really a different way

79
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,270
to quote prices for risky bonds.

80
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,640
Using the numbers for the XYZ bond, the figure on the slide

81
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,180
illustrates the different yields and premiums

82
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,960
we have just introduced.

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,800
The bond's promised yield is 12%.

84
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,290
It can be decomposed into three components from bottom up.

85
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,280
In absence of default risk, we have the default-free yield,

86
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,560
which is 8%.

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,840
Given the default risk, there will

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,960
be a risk premium, which is 1%.

89
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,120
The sum of the two gives 9%, which is the expected yield.

90
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,640
The default premium is the actual yield

91
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,850
the bond has to promise to compensate the default

92
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,140
scenarios.

93
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,330
It is 3% in this example.

94
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,810
Adding it to the expected yield gives us

95
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,740
the promised yield of 12%.

96
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,440
This is also the highest yield we can

97
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,230
obtain when the promise is met.

98
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,530
In all other scenarios, which means default,

99
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,690
the yield will be lower.

100
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,290
The lowest yield possible is minus 100%,

101
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,160
which is when the payoff from the bond is 0.

102
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
What we do next is to further examine

103
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,060
the factors that are affecting the default premium or bond

104
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,720
price.

105
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,050
The first is the likelihood of default.

106
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,510
If the probability of default is 0,

107
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,450
the default premium will also be 0.

108
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,250
This factor is what the rating agencies focus on.

109
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,450
The second factor is the amount of financial loss when default

110
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,530
occurs, or more precisely, the probability distribution

111
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,470
of potential losses.

112
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,130
Let's examine these two factors and their relationship

113
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,950
to default premium in more detail.

114
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,100
We do so by using an example.

115
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,560
Suppose that a firm wants to issue a one-year bond

116
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,820
with a par value of $1,000.

117
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,290
It has a non-trivial default risk.

118
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,300
Its probability of default, denoted by p, is 6%.

119
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,650
In the case of default, the loss rate, denoted by lambda,

120
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,820
is 10%.

121
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,080
That is, only 1 minus lambda, which is 90% of the promised

122
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,890
payment, will be paid in the case of default.

123
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,380
1 minus lambda is also called the "recovery rate."

124
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,770
The expected yield by the market, denoted by y bar,

125
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,350
is 10% for bonds with similar default risks.

126
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,570
The firm wants to issue the bond at par.

127
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,930
The question is, what should be the coupon rate?

128
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,470
Since the bond is selling at par,

129
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,400
the promised yield is the promise coupon rate.

130
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,350
Let it be y.

131
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,310
We then have the first equation on the slide.

132
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,760
That is, the gross expected return or yield,

133
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,020
1 plus y bar, which is the left-hand side,

134
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,290
equals the probability of no default, which

135
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,840
is 1 minus p, times the promise gross yield, 1 plus y,

136
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,870
plus the probability of default, p,

137
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,710
times the gross yield in the case of default, which

138
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,530
is given by the recovery rate 1 minus

139
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,600
lambda, times the promised gross yield, 1 plus y.

140
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,840
Solve for y, the promised yield, we

141
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,110
obtain the second equation on the slide--

142
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,940
y equals y bar plus p times lambda divided

143
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,920
by 1 minus p times lambda.

144
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,270
Substituting numbers, we have 0.1,

145
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,980
which is y bar, plus 0.06--

146
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,970
that's the default rate--

147
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,590
times 0.1, which is the loss rate, and then

148
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,730
divide by 1 minus 0.06 times 0.1.

149
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,995
Finishing the calculation, we get 10.66%.

150
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,490
That is, the promised coupon rate

151
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:32,710
should be 10.66% in order to issue the bond at par.

152
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,210
In this case, the default premium is 10.66 minus 10.

153
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,040
And that's 0.66%, which is pretty small.

154
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,940
The reason is that not only the default probability is not

155
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,050
very high--

156
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:55,560
nearly 6% plus the recovery rate of 90%, which

157
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,890
is quite high, in the case of default. Therefore,

158
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,200
the bond's default premium is mainly

159
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,550
determined by its default probability and recovery rate

160
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,700
when defaulted.
