JOHN CORE: Now for problem 1, so you've worked on problem 1.

1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,960
As a reminder, problem 1 asked you to do a balance sheet

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,600
equation for income taxes.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,180
Second, it asked you to do a balance sheet equation

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,610
for Tesla valuation allowance in 2019.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,550
And third, it asked you to think about what

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,810
would happen if Tesla's US taxable income was either

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,320
$1 billion higher than it was in 2019 or $1 billion lower

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,460
than it was in 2019.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,680
So let's first look at the balance sheet

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,500
equation for income taxes.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,470
We're taking all this information out of note 15

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,640
of the financial statements.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,630
Notice that this is the current taxes that we've seen before.

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:58,160
So Tesla paid cash taxes in 2019 of $91 million.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,150
Its accounting expense for taxes was $110 million.

16
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,100
And the difference between that is an increase in its deferred

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,100
tax liability of $19 million.

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,390
The second part of the question asked

19
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,780
you to do the balance sheet equation for Tesla's valuation

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,210
allowance in 2019.

21
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,720
Again, this comes out of this table in note 15.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,470
You can see that from the table the valuation allowance

23
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,390
increased by $91 million.

24
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,380
And to reflect that in the balance sheet equation,

25
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,540
we're going to want to increase the valuation allowance contra

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,580
asset.

27
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,650
And that's going to result in an increase in income tax expense.

28
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,670
And we can also see the same answer in a different format

29
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,670
in this table, which shows us the change

30
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,040
and the net operating loss carryforwards.

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,190
So Tesla's net operating loss carryforwards

32
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,540
increased in 2019, as did their valuation allowance.

33
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,650
So an answer of $150 million change

34
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,230
from the valuation allowance from this table

35
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,520
is also a good answer.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,110
And then finally, notice the Tesla in their annual report

37
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,400
said, we intend to keep increasing this valuation

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,640
allowance so long as we have increases

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,420
in deferred taxes or net operating loss carryforwards.

40
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,550
And essentially what Tesla is telling you

41
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,340
there is that they do not expect to be

42
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,180
profitable for US tax purposes for many years in the future.

43
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,430
So if you ever see this language change in their annual report,

44
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,530
that would be good news for somebody that

45
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,080
was positive on Tesla's stock.

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,172
So if Tesla's US taxable income was $1 billion higher,

47
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,630
we know that they've got $2 billion

48
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,420
of net operating loss carryforwards

49
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,810
from the prior slide.

50
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,160
So those net operating loss carryforwards

51
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,710
would offset those higher income.

52
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,360
And Tesla would owe $0 in extra taxes.

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,790
Conversely, if their taxable income was $1 billion lower,

54
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,900
because they've got currently negative US taxable income,

55
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,030
they're not paying US taxes.

56
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,020
That extra loss will make their taxable income even more

57
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,220
negative.

58
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,770
And it will create an additional net operating

59
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,480
loss carryforward.

60
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,500
So it will result in the near term in no extra taxes.

61
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,000
