00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,140
JOHN CORE: The problem with 3 asked you about Tesla's stock

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,080
offering in 2019.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,360
And so we're going to split this up into parts.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,480
First, I ask you about the par value

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,220
if Tesla issued r million shares of stock.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,010
And the reason I'm asking you it this way

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,040
is because Tesla in their annual report

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,250
rounds all their figures to $1 million.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,470
So then we want to think about what's

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,060
a par value of 4 million shares of common stock

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,420
if we round it to millions of dollars.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,560
Then finally, that will allow us to do the balance sheet

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,770
equation for this equity issuance.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,300
And then as a side issue, again, because of the rounding issues,

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,460
we're going to ask, based solely on the information in the 10K,

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,740
how many shares did Tesla actually issue in this offer.

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,310
So our first part is, what's the par value of 4 million shares.

18
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,880
So if Tesla sold 4 million shares of common stock,

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,590
what would be their par value?

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,450
So from the face of the balance sheet,

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,780
which is on page 65 of the 10K, we know that Tesla's stock has

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,220
a par value of 1/1,000 of $1.

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,380
So if we multiply 4 million times 1/1,000 of a dollar,

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,980
that gives us $4,000 as the par value of 4 million shares.

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,100
The trick, though, is Tesla reports in millions.

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,380
So what's the par value of 4 million shares of common stock

27
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,600
if we convert it to millions?

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,360
So we'll take that same $4,000 par

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,890
value, divide it by $1 million, and that

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,970
gives us a par value of 0.004.

31
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,940
And when we round that to the nearest millions,

32
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:06,490
the par value of that common stock is $0 millions.

33
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:12,100
So here's some data from the 10K on pages 68 and 69

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,470
of their 2019 10K.

35
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,870
So first of all, we look for evidence

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,620
from their statement of cash flows.

37
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,730
So in their cash flow from financing statement,

38
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:28,200
we see that they raised $848 million in this offering.

39
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,650
Then on page 68, we see that from their statement

40
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,600
on shareholders' equity that they issued three shares.

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,010
So that's rounded three shares.

42
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,440
And those three shares had a par value,

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,430
as we talked about a minute ago, of $0.

44
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,470
An additional paid-in-capital was $848 million.

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,070
And because of the fact, as we talked about before, because

46
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,450
of the fact that cash is equal to additional paid-in-capital,

47
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,320
we know that Tesla recorded the underwriting expenses, which

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,890
are in a red box there, of $15 million.

49
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,340
They recorded those underwriting expenses

50
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,180
as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital.

51
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,690
So here's our balance sheet equation taking

52
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,780
that information.

53
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,460
So cash went up when Tesla issued these shares

54
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,650
by $848 million.

55
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,530
We know that there was an increase

56
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,550
in the par value of common stock, but that rounds to $0

57
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,510
again.

58
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,930
An additional paid-in-capital goes up, again,

59
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,570
by $848 million.

60
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,100


61
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,310
Now the final question in this segment

62
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,500
is based solely on the information in the 10K.

63
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,060
How many shares did Tesla issue?

64
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,350
We know that Tesla raised $848 million.

65
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,140
We know that they paid $!5 million worth of offering

66
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,710
expenses.

67
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:03,200
We know that the issuance price of the stock was $243 a share.

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,050
So our best guess is the number of shares

69
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:12,070
that Tesla issued is 3,551,440.

70
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,430
And then if we're interested in exactly what the number is,

71
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,339
and this is not something I ask you to do,

72
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,760
we can go to their prospective supplement

73
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,960
where they actually tell you the details of this offering

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,760
after it happens.

75
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,740
They tell you that they issued 3.549 million shares

76
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,380
at a price of $243.

77
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,490
And that gives them gross proceeds of $863 million.

78
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,190
If we subtract $15 million of underwriting expenses,

79
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,560
then we come back to the number that we know,

80
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,910
which is $848 million net proceeds.

81
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,600
So that's problem 3.
