1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,420
PROFESSOR: Problem 4 is also asking you

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,140
about Tesla's offerings, but this is a convertible debt

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,610
offering.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,150
And I've broken this down into four questions.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,190
First, what's the value of the bond payment?

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,480
So that's principal and interest payments

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,480
that this bond is going to pay discounted

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,090
at the market rate of interest.

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,560
So we have to figure out what the market rate of interest is.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,980
And then once we figure that out,

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,860
what's the balance sheet equation for the issue ignoring

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,650
issuance cost?

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,330
And then we're just going to also say,

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,820
what's the balance sheet equation for the issuance

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,610
cost separately?

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,850
And then finally, just to summarize everything,

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,670
we're going to ask you to account for the first six

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,510
months of interest.

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,340
And here's some verbiage that I've collected out

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,500
of Tesla's annual report talking about these convertible senior

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,050
notes due 2024.

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,220
So we issued them in May 2019.

23
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:12,520
We issued $1.84 billion in 2% convertible notes.

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,110
Net proceeds from the issuance after issuance costs

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,620
were $1.82 million--

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,640
$1.82 billion.

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,310
So that we know the issuance costs from this

28
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,470
were $20 million.

29
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,440
And then it tells us the debt discount

30
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,350
is being amortized at an effective interest

31
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,890
rate of 8.68%.

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,840
So that's the market interest rate

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,930
that we're going to use for later computations.

34
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,510
And it also tells us that if Tesla had issued straight debt

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,900
with no conversion feature, the effective interest

36
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,140
rate on that straight debt would have been 8.68%.

37
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,540
So by including the conversion feature,

38
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,860
as we talked about in a recent session,

39
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,720
Tesla is saving the difference between 8.68% interest, which

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,660
is what it would have paid, versus 2% interest,

41
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,360
which is what it is paying.

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,340
And that 6.68% savings reflects the fact

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,540
that Tesla has attached a conversion feature, where

44
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,240
the holders of these notes can turn them

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,440
into a stock at an attractive rate sometime in the future.

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,050
So finally, what the verbiage here on the slide says

47
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,110
is that each of the $1,000 of the notes

48
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,820
is convertible into 3.2276 shares of stock.

49
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,190
So that's a conversion price of $310, basically.

50
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,970
And that was 28% above the price at the time

51
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,370
the things were offered.

52
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,960
And that, in turn, means that the shares issued on conversion

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,840
are $1.84 billion divided by 1,000 times the conversion

54
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,490
factor, or we would issue about 5.9 million shares

55
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,350
if these notes converted.

56
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,570
So this is a slide that we've seen before, and it seems--

57
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,670
8.68% interest seems huge in the current environment.

58
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,520
But notice that this slide shows the yields on Tesla's 5.3%

59
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,910
straight debt have gone up over time

60
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,040
since it was issued, up until the recent past

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,690
in the 9% range.

62
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,770
So at the time that they offered the 2024 notes,

63
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:47,250
the market interest rate on the 5.3% bonds were close to 9%.

64
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,810
And so that's where the 8.68% interest is coming from.

65
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,720
Now, in terms of discounting the payments

66
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,020
on the new convertible senior notes,

67
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,120
remember these are five-year notes,

68
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,020
so there'll be 10 payments.

69
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,090
The interest expense on the notes

70
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:13,350
is $1.84 billion times 2% divided by 2

71
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,000
to make it same semiannual.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,980
So the interest expense is $18.4 million semiannually.

73
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,320
Of course, the principal comes due

74
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,700
as well as the interest at the end of the fifth year,

75
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,380
or in other words, at the end of the 10th semi-annual period.

76
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,410
That's what's shown in the second column.

77
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,820
In the third column, we're just discounting those cash flows

78
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,430
at the market rate of interest, which is 8.68% divided by 2,

79
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,930
or 4.34%.

80
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,310
And then we come up with a present value of these notes

81
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:57,480
of about $1.35 billion.

82
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,255
So the difference between the value

83
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:03,240
of the straight debt, which is $1.35 billion,

84
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,220
and the notes themselves, which is $1.84 billion,

85
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,760
that difference is $490 million.

86
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,250
And remember, we talked in the class about convertible debt,

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,240
that this gives you a value for the conversion option.

88
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,020
And by contrast, Tesla calculates a number

89
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,910
that's very close but a little different,

90
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,280
which is $491 million for the conversion option.

91
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,380
And the difference, of course, is

92
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,190
there is probably some rounding error, and part of the fact

93
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,670
is that when we did our calculation a minute ago,

94
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,090
we didn't account for the fact that the debt maturity is not

95
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,470
exactly 10 years.

96
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,220
So here's our balance sheet equation having gathered

97
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,240
this information.

98
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,770
We know that we got cash of 18--

99
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,900
$1.84 billion, ignoring the issuance cost.

100
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,530
We issued notes with a face value of $1.84 billion.

101
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,840
The discount on the notes is $491 million.

102
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,280
So net notes payable is $1.349 billion.

103
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,415
And the difference between the face value

104
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:21,120
of the notes and the net notes payable

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,910
is going to, again, with these convertible notes, is

106
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,080
going to go to additional paid-in capital of $491

107
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,616
million.

108
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:31,680
And the balance sheet equation, of course,

109
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,790
with the issuance cost is that cash goes down,

110
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,040
and then we're going to capitalize those issuance

111
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,671
costs of $20 million.

112
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:45,310
Now, finally, this slide is just a reminder slide

113
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,850
from our bond discussion.

114
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,790
So remember, for financial reporting purposes,

115
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,370
interest expense is the market rate

116
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,990
at the time the bond is issued.

117
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,160
That's our 8.68% here, times the net bond payable,

118
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,580
which is $1.349 billion.

119
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,450
Conversely, interest payable is the coupon rate,

120
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:12,550
which is 2% times the face amount or the par amount,

121
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,580
which is the $1.84 billion.

122
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,350
And then as a reminder, any difference between these two

123
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,040
is going to be amortized against either the bond discount

124
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,070
account, which is what we have in this case,

125
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,350
or a bond premium account.

126
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,380
So accounting for the first six months of interest then,

127
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,310
looking over on the right.

128
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,940
So again, our interest expense is the net bond

129
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,280
payable of $1.349 billion times the market

130
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,990
rate at interest rate--

131
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,540
market interest rate, which is 8.68%,

132
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,680
divided by 2 to make it semiannual.

133
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,810
So the interest expense is $58.5 million.

134
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,150
As we saw earlier, the coupon payment is $18.4 million,

135
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,400
and the $40.1 million difference between these things

136
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,670
is the amortization of the discount.

137
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,750
So that's our accounting using the balance sheet equation

138
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,500
for the first six months of interest.

139
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,000
