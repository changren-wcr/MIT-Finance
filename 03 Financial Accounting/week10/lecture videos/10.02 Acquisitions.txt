PROFESSOR: So the second problem is a brief problem.
It just ask you to do the balance sheet equation
for Tesla's acquisition of Maxwell technologies.
Tesla talks about this on page 90 of their annual report.
Now recall that the total purchase price
consisted of $207 million in new stock
that Tesla issued for this.
But Tesla also converted to Tesla's stock a Maxwell
Technology equity compensation.
So the total purchase price then was $215 million.
And that consisted of tangible assets of $128 million,
intangible assets of $105 million.
And then the difference was goodwill of $79 million
and liabilities of $97 million.
