PROFESSOR: Problem 6 asks about Tesla's free cash flow.
Remember, from our discussions of the cash flow statement,
free cash flow is cash flow from operations
minus capital expenditures.
And after you subtract off capital expenditures
from cash flow from operations, free cash flow, which in 2019,
was $973 million.
That's how much money the Tesla could use to repay debt
or could use or give its stockholders a return.
