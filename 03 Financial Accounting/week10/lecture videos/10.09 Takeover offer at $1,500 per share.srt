1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,250
PROFESSOR: So the ninth problem, which

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,160
is a final problem that I asked you to do,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,310
is to think what happened-- what would the value of Tesla

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:16,219
be if there were a takeover offer at $1,500 a share?

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,250
I know that it's a little bit unrealistic,

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,030
because Tesla's stock price is obviously greater than $1,500

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,030
a share.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,210
But let's just suppose for this example

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,870
that they get a takeover offer at $1,500 per share.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,950
We want to value the shares outstanding.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,290
We want to value the options outstanding

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,820
using the Treasury stock method that we learned about earlier.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,840
And then we want to value the convertible notes outstanding

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,630
using the if converted method that we also

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,380
learned about earlier.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,040
So we get the data.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,730
Part of it is from the face of the balance sheet.

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,530
So the face of the balance sheet tells us

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,860
that Tesla has 181 million shares outstanding.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,400
In the footnotes-- and we talked about this in an earlier

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,510
problem--

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,190
we know about the information in the 2024 converts

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,470
from the footnotes for the financial statements.

24
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,520
And then we also can get stock option information

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,100
from the footnotes from the financial statement.

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,100
And that tells us there are about 30 million stock

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,390
options outstanding.

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,370
And the exercise price is $279.49 per share.

29
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,310
So first let's value the common shares outstanding.

30
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,200
So that's easy.

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,430
So there's 181 million shares outstanding.

32
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,910
We're assuming a share price of $1,500

33
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,010
in this pretend takeover.

34
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,060
And that gives us a value for the common shares outstanding

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,140
of 271 and 1/2 billion dollars, which is a big company.

36
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,400
So Tesla is now one of the biggest 20 companies

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,890
by market capitalization on the US stock exchanges.

38
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,520
Next thing we want to do is value the options outstanding.

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,789
So again, options outstanding, we

40
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,150
have about 30 million options outstanding.

41
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:18,090
The exercise price on these options is about $279.

42
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,880
And what the Treasury stock method does

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,750
is that we assume that all the options outstanding are

44
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,000
exercised at that $279 price.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,900
And then that would give us exercise price proceeds

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,010
of about $8 billion.

47
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:41,100
We use that $8 billion to repurchase shares

48
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,740
at a price of $1,500 a share.

49
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,530
So we could repurchase 5 and 1/2 million shares.

50
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,440
So the net new shares that are going

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,890
to be issued if all these options get exercised

52
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,680
at $1,500 a share are about 24.4 million shares.

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,150
And then if we value them at $1,500 a share,

54
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,560
that gives us a value of about $36.6 billion

55
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,460
in terms of the options outstanding.

56
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,870
Finally, we need to value the converts using

57
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,410
the if convert method.

58
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,120
So I'm just going to focus on what we were asked here, was

59
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,340
the 2024 notes.

60
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,480
Remember, there's $1.84 billion of 2024 notes outstanding.

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,990
They have a conversion ratio of 3.2276 shares per $1,000.

62
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,980
So if all the notes convert, there

63
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,990
would be about 5.9 million shares.

64
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,370
And if we value those 5.9 million shares

65
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,860
at $1,500 a share, we come up with almost $9 billion

66
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,900
for those shares.

67
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,000
And so here I presented a table that

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,460
shows the value of the common stock,

69
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,630
the value of the options, and the value of three

70
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,300
of the major converts outstanding.

71
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,950
And what's interesting about this

72
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,000
and what is a key takeaway for US professionals is

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,890
for a techie company like this, if you buy the whole company,

74
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,680
the common shares outstanding in Tesla's case

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,680
are only worth 83% of the company.

76
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,620
You've got to also come up with a lot of money--

77
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,940
in this case, that's over $55 billion from the options

78
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,510
and from the three convertible securities--

79
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,350
to buy out the options and to buy out the convertible shares

80
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,500
outstanding.
