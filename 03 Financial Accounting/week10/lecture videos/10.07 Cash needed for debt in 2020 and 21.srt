00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,130
JOHN CORE: Problem 7, we're starting

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,920
to look more deeply in the cash flow statement now,

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,830
asked how much cash does Tesla need for debt principal in 2020

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,240
and 2021.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,490
So one thing we want to know is how much

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,830
Tesla debt matures in 2020, how much Tesla debt matures

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,780
in 2021.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,300
And then recognizing that some of this debt

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,580
is convertible debt, it asked in 2020, how much of the debt

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,720
will turn into stock or convert into stock if the stock

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,550
price is greater than $300.

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,340
And then similarly, in 2021, how much of the debt

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,520
will convert into stock if the stock

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,570
price is greater than 360?

15
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,200
One place that we talked about looking for this information

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,660
is the contractual obligations table.

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,890
So on page 58 of the 10K, Tesla presents

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,590
their contractual obligations.

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,830
And it shows total amount of principal and interest,

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,380
so schedule interest, for 2020 and 2021.

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,930
But we're looking for just principle amount, not interest.

22
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,820
Fortunately, there's another table in note 12

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,580
which shows recourse debt and non-recourse debt, and then

24
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,430
total principal amounts coming due in 2020 and 2021.

25
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,650
And here we have the answers that we want,

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:43,700
which is about $1.4 billion in 2022, $2.3 billion in 2021.

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,750
Just as an aside, we haven't seen this concept

28
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,230
of recourse debt before, but non-recourse debt

29
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,180
is like your car loan.

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,060
So if you do not pay your car loan,

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,610
the bank will come and take your car,

32
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,100
but they can't take other assets from you.

33
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,440
So that's non-recourse debt.

34
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,290
Recourse debt is what you don't want to have,

35
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,990
is that the lender can take your car.

36
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,420
And then if you still owe money on the debt,

37
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,685
they can take your other personal assets.

38
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:17,090
So recourse debt for corporations

39
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,570
and for individuals is dangerous.

40
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,750
In terms of cash needed for debt,

41
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,140
this is answering the question of how much converts we have.

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,760
So at the top of the table, we see that there's

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,170
the 1.25% notes due in 2021.

44
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,970
And we know that they have a conversion

45
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,920
price of $360 a share.

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,410
So in 2021, if these notes come due

47
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,400
and the stock price is greater than $360,

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,620
these things will turn into stock

49
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,500
and we won't have to pay cash for them.

50
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,210
Similarly, the zero coupon convertible notes due in 2020

51
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,000
have a conversion price of $300 a share.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,810
So if these notes come due and the stock price is above $300

53
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,850
a share, the holders of the notes will choose to take stock

54
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,500
and Tesla will not have to pay these notes off in cash.

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,000
