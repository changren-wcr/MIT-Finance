00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,059
PROFESSOR: In this session, which is our last session,

1
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,130
we're going to use the Tesla case as a way to do a review

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,030
and to focus on liquidity and cash flow.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,100
As a review, remember that firms need operating cash flow,

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,160
also known as cash flow from operations,

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,830
to finance their investments.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,690
In order to grow, Tesla must build new factories.

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,270
And these investments in new factories

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,680
are investing cash flows.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,020
It needs operating cash flow to pay down its debt.

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,170
And it needs operating cash flow, ultimately,

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,620
to return capital to its shareholders.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,150
Paying down debt and returning capital to shareholders

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,060
are Tesla's financing cash flows.

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,800
In this session, we're going to use Tesla's 2019

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,090
financial statements to review, first, taxes,

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,150
then acquisitions, then equity and debt issues, then leases,

17
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,290
diluted shares, and finally, a review of cash flow.

18
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,390
I will give you one or more problems

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,820
for each of these topics.

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,000
After the problem, there will be slides

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,300
and a video discussing the solutions.

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,120
These Tesla case problems will not be graded.

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,160
The point of the problem is to help you review for the exam.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,180
Again, after the problems, there are slides

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,890
and a video discussing the solutions.

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,490
But to get the most out of the review,

27
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,130
I recommend that you do the problems first

28
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,300
as if you were taking an exam.

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,490
Then after you've tried the problems

30
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,150
and solved the problems, review the slides and video

31
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,950
discussing the solutions.

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,910
As background on Tesla, at the time of the case,

33
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,480
Tesla's primary business is building electric cars

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,980
and electric trucks.

35
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,940
Tesla came public in June of 2010,

36
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,130
when it executed its initial public offering, or IPO,

37
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,700
at a price of $17 a share.

38
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,400
Its financial performance since then has been very strong.

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,570
It has had high growth, high growth in revenues,

40
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,770
and high growth in its stock price.

41
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:38,170
In the middle of July 2020, its stock price was about $1,500

42
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,400
a share.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,310
However, Tesla has had a history of losses,

44
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,130
as startup companies often do, and has

45
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,990
had a history of negative cash flow from operations.

46
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:59,290
Although, in 2018 and 2019, that negative cash

47
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,630
flow from operations has turned positive.

48
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,660
In terms of concerns about Tesla,

49
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,590
competition is one concern with a company like this

50
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,310
that's so highly valued.

51
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,760
We know that there are other electric car and truck

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,460
companies coming into this industry

53
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,740
because the industry is so attractive.

54
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,350
Second, COVID has affected all of us.

55
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,400
COVID affected Tesla because its factories were shut down

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,990
for a while at the start of 2020, and demand for its cars

57
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,130
was lower.

58
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,890
This slide summarizes Tesla's performance

59
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:47,510
for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019.

60
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,080
The 2017 fiscal year is on the right.

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,370
The 2019 fiscal year is in the center.

62
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,470
Notice that Tesla has tripled the number of vehicles

63
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,230
it delivered from 2017 to 2019.

64
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,350
It has doubled its sales.

65
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,850
Its 2019 net income is still negative,

66
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,430
but it's less negative than it was in 2017.

67
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,390
Operating cash flow turned positive in 2018.

68
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,770
Investing cash flow, which is Tesla's acquisitions

69
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,040
of factories, new property, plant, and equipment,

70
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,500
has gotten smaller.

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,050
Therefore, because of the smaller shortfall

72
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,340
between operating cash flow and investing cash flow,

73
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,140
financing cash flow has decreased from $4.4 billion

74
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,920
in 2017 to $1.5 billion in 2019.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,290
Here's a slide that we've seen before when

76
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,110
we were talking about bonds.

77
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,510
In the middle of 2019, Tesla's main publicly-traded bond

78
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,310
was trading for about $0.82 on the dollar.

79
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,640
At that time, Tesla's bond price was

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,970
flashing a risk of bankruptcy.

81
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,940
Since then, the bond has recovered.

82
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,300
In early 2020, the price is back over 100.

83
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,940
This higher bond price is telling us

84
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,560
that the risk that Tesla goes bankrupt is now lower.

85
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,970
Here is a chart of Tesla's stock price for the five years ended

86
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,940
July 10, 2020.

87
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,200
Notice that Tesla initially sold off in 2020--

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,250
in early 2020-- when the rest of the market also sold off.

89
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,000
But since then, it's accelerated,

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,380
and it's gone up to a price of about $1,500 a share

91
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,700
as of July 10, 2020.

92
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,900
Later on, we're going to use this price of $1,500

93
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,510
as part of our case.

94
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,010
But please do the case as if you received these 2019

95
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,340
financial statements early in 2020.

96
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,160
Tesla's performance has substantially

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,420
improved since the time of the case in early 2020.

98
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,360
And I want to summarize, briefly, two developments

99
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,616
at Tesla since then--

100
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:22,520
since the time of the 2019 financial statements.

101
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,410
First, Tesla split its stock 5 for 1.

102
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,370
Second, Tesla has done a number of stock offerings

103
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,040
and raised a lot of equity capital.

104
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,600
But Tesla split its stock 5 for 1 on August 28, 2020.

105
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:47,350
Just before the split, Tesla's price was $2,213,

106
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,920
and it had 186.4 million shares outstanding.

107
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,520
Now, as a review of our discussions of stock splits,

108
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,910
how many shares did it have outstanding immediately

109
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,140
after the split?

110
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,780
Well, this was a 5-for-1 split.

111
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,920
Tesla started with 186.4 million shares.

112
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,960
We're going to multiply that by 5.

113
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
So immediately after the split, Tesla

114
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,860
had 932 million shares outstanding.

115
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,460
Also as a review, what was the price

116
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,160
immediately after the split?

117
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,890
Again, it was a 5-for-1 split.

118
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:33,140
The price before the split was $2,213.

119
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,890
We divide that by 5.

120
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:41,480
So the price immediately after the split was $442.60.

121
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,290
Also, we noted above that the July 10, 2020 presplit price

122
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,010
was $1,500.

123
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,230
What was the split-adjusted price?

124
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,290
So this one is a little bit easier, mathematically.

125
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,350
Again, it was a 5-for-1 split.

126
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,420
The price was $1,500.

127
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:07,870
We divide that by 5 to come up with a $300 postsplit price.

128
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,640
Now, the second major development

129
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,190
at Tesla since the 2019 financial statements

130
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,660
is related to the fact that, on December 31, 2020,

131
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,820
Tesla's stock price has risen to a price of $705.

132
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:30,000
Now, notice that this is equivalent to a price of $3,525

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,960
presplit.

134
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,350
So it's a big price increase in 2020.

135
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,710
And Tesla took advantage of this price increase

136
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,340
to do three stock offerings in 2020.

137
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,820
And in total, over these three stock offerings,

138
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,510
Tesla raised $12.3 billion.

139
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,940
Because of the money raised through these stock offerings

140
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:00,750
and because of strong cash flow in 2020, Tesla, in early 2021,

141
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,520
has low need for liquidity or extra cash.

142
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,710
In contrast, in 2019, at the time of our case,

143
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,120
Tesla had a big need for liquidity, a big need for cash.

144
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,990
I wanted to tell you about these developments at Tesla

145
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,350
since the 2019 financial statements

146
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,830
to give you background for you when you encounter

147
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,030
Tesla outside this course.

148
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,720
Again, though, please do the case

149
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,620
as if you received the 2019 financial statements

150
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,110
in early 2020.

151
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,170
Please conduct your analysis solely

152
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,600
based on these statements and what

153
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,210
was known about Tesla in early 2020.
