1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,580
PROFESSOR: So pulling this all together--

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,880
and this is our final segment here

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,330
that we're going to work through--

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,370
we're going to compute free cash flow to equity, which

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,330
is equal to cash flow from operations minus capital

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,270
expenditures minus required debt and least principal payments.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,350
Recall that CFO, or cash flow from operations,

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,980
reflects cash interest on debt and leases,

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,380
so we only subtract principal payments.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:39,510
So Tesla's estimated free cash flow to equity in 2021--

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,940
I'm going to assume that cash flow from operations

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,110
is the same, so it's about $2.4 billion.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,540
I'm going to assume capital expenditure's the same--

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,080
about $1.4 billion.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,880
That gives us the free cash flow that we computed

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,030
earlier of $973 million.

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,430
Remember, we talked about debt principal

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,530
that need to be repaid--

19
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,850
$1.4 billion in 2020, $2.3 billion in 2021.

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,870
But if we assume that the stock price is above $360 a share,

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,070
some of this debt-- $103 million of the debt

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,780
will turn into stocks, so we don't

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,440
have to come up with cash for it in 2020.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,760
And then $1.38 billion worth of the debt

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,190
will turn into stock in 2021.

26
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,720
And then here's where we computed--

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,440
the least principal do is $401 million in 2020

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,330
and $423 million in 2021.

29
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,620
So notice that, when we computed all of this out,

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,620
the free cash flow left over for the equity is about minus $800

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:08,090
million in 2020, and it's about minus $1.7 billion in 2021.

32
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,540
If this negative free cash flow from equity persists,

33
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,370
then stockholders will need to contribute more capital

34
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,360
through stock sales for Tesla to survive.

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Ultimately, for a company to have value for stockholders,

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,690
free cash flow from equity must be positive.

37
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,240
That means that Tesla has to sell equity in these scenarios

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,580
equal to $800 million in 2020 and equal to $1.7 billion

39
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,890
in 2021, because of the fact that it's not generating

40
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,070
enough cash flow from operations and it

41
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,670
has to repay lots of debt so that its free cash

42
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,060
flow to equity is negative.

43
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,830
So that's our base scenario.

44
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,960
Now, as we all know, we're living in a world of COVID,

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,770
and COVID affected Tesla, because Tesla's plants

46
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,460
were closed, among other ways that affected Tesla.

47
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,460
Tesla's California plant was closed

48
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,530
for most of the first quarter--

49
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,110
for all of the first quarter and part of the second quarter,

50
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,910
so Tesla's sales have dipped compared

51
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,580
where they were last year.

52
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,250
So that brings the question, if you

53
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,810
want to form a bear case for Tesla, maybe think about,

54
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,500
how much cash flow from operations, first of all,

55
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,530
would Tesla generate if Tesla's sales decreased by 50%?

56
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,870
And to make this a little simpler,

57
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,208
we're going to assume that all of Tesla's sales are for cash.

58
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,500
This is reasonable, because if you look at the balance,

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,710
sheet Tesla has small accounts receivable.

60
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:05,730
And then we that cash sales are going to go down by 50%,

61
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,660
so if cash sales go down by 50%, will cash operating

62
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,320
expenses also go down by 50%?

63
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,959
And this is a little bit subtle, but think

64
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,029
about depreciation charges.

65
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,290
So that's a non-cash charge.

66
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,530
Non-cash depreciation charges won't change,

67
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,810
so when sales go down by 50%, operating expenses

68
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,180
are going to go down by less than 50%,

69
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,080
because those fixed charges, like depreciation,

70
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,090
are not going to change.

71
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,210
And therefore, since cash expenses

72
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,540
are going to decrease slower than cash sales are going

73
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,200
to decrease, cash flow from operations

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,725
is going to decrease by more than 50%.

75
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:55,600
And what we're going to do in the next slides

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,020
is just try to ballpark how much of a decrease

77
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,800
there will be in cash flow from operations,

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,710
if cash sales decrease by 50%.

79
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,290
So to do this, let's just look at a summary of Tesla's 2019

80
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,480
income statement.

81
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,180
So I just put the income items into buckets.

82
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,110
So we've got revenue or sales.

83
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,140
We got operating expenses, which are cost of goods sold,

84
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,630
selling general expenses, research and development

85
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,270
expenses, and other expenses.

86
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,000
They're almost as big as revenue.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,740
We've got interest expense.

88
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,420
We've got taxes.

89
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,990
And then that gives us Tesla's net income, or net loss--

90
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,640
$775 million.

91
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,370
I'm going to do the same thing with their cash flow statement.

92
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,740
So this is their cash flow from operations.

93
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:58,105
It starts with their net loss of $775 million.

94
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:01,870
And then I'm at a group all these non-cash operating

95
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,720
expenses together-- so depreciation,

96
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,420
stock-based compensation, and other.

97
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,850
That's a $3.3 billion add-back.

98
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,380
And as we talked about earlier in the session,

99
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,530
part of the interest expense is non-cash,

100
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,080
so we're going to add back the non-cash interest

101
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,880
expense of about $188 million.

102
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,580
And as we noticed at the very beginning of this session,

103
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,100
there's deferred taxes of $19 million.

104
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,310
We're going to add back those, and then we're

105
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,850
going to subtract off the changes in working capital

106
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,460
to get cash flow from operations.

107
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,230
And then we're going to put it together.

108
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,620
So the first column that says income

109
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,830
is just the income statement that I just showed you.

110
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,850
The second column, which is called adjustments,

111
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,780
are the adjustments that we just saw in the cash flow statement.

112
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,860
And then, when we add those across, based on our assumption

113
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,980
that revenue is all cash--

114
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,276
so cash revenue is $24 and 1/2 billion.

115
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:12,046
Operating expenses that are cash are about $21 billion.

116
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:15,450
Cash interest, again, is about $500 million cash.

117
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,840
Cash taxes are $91 million.

118
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,550
Then we take the changes in working capital,

119
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,100
and that allows us to recharacterize the cash flow

120
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,340
statement as a cash income statement.

121
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,020
So having done that, we take this cash income

122
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,050
statement, which is the first column on this table--

123
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:46,250
we had $2.4 billion in cash flow from operations in 2019,

124
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,610
and this consisted of cash sales of about $24

125
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:56,780
and 1/2 billion minus cash expenses of about $22 billion.

126
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,710
And then pro forma for this 50% change--

127
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,130
revenue's going to drop by 50%.

128
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,730
Our cash operating expenses, we're going to assume,

129
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,350
are going to drop by 50%.

130
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,480
Cash interest is not going to change

131
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,200
because we can't change how much we pay back our debt holders.

132
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,870
Cash taxes are not going to change, again,

133
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,470
because we cannot change how much cash taxes we pay

134
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,690
to various governments.

135
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,330
We're going to assume that the working capital changes are

136
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,970
going to be cut by 50%.

137
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,790
And then, consistent with the intuition that we developed

138
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,840
earlier, pro forma cash flow from operations

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,250
in the third column is about $900 million,

140
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,910
which is well less than 50% of 2019 cash flow from operations

141
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,960
of $2.4 billion.

142
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,860
In this slide, let's recompute cash

143
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,220
flow to equity, assuming that Tesla sells

144
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,710
50% less in 2020 and in 2021.

145
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,340
So this is the same chart that we saw a few minutes ago,

146
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,460
except we're putting the lower cash flow from operations

147
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,660
in the top.

148
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,150
We're, again, subtracting off capex.

149
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,890
That gives us negative free cash flow.

150
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,770
We're subtracting off a debt principal.

151
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,090
And then, assuming that Tesla sales fall this much,

152
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,220
we're going to assume that maybe the price falls

153
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,440
below $300 a share.

154
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,750
So it's not going to be converting that debt

155
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,450
into stock, which saves cash, but it's

156
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,090
going to have to pay all the cash back

157
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,740
on the debt principal.

158
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,500
We got our lease principal, and then we've

159
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,310
got free cash flow from equity of minus $2.3 billion in 2020

160
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,930
and minus $3.2 billion in 2021--

161
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,110
so that Tesla, in this bear case,

162
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:02,070
if they, in fact, sold 50% less in 2020 than they did in 2021,

163
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,390
their free cash flow to equity would be very negative,

164
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,490
and this would push the company back

165
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,870
towards where we saw it in the middle of 2019, which

166
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,680
is flirting with bankruptcy.

167
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,790
So again, in this session, we essentially reviewed

168
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,130
material and synthesized material

169
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,750
that we learned early in the course.

170
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,110
So we reviewed taxes, we reviewed leases,

171
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,610
we reviewed debt and equity, and we reviewed a lot of things.

172
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,810
And we looked at Tesla's financial statement in detail

173
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,330
