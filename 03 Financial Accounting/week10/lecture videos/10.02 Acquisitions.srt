00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,340
PROFESSOR: So the second problem is a brief problem.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,150
It just ask you to do the balance sheet equation

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:12,430
for Tesla's acquisition of Maxwell technologies.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:18,050
Tesla talks about this on page 90 of their annual report.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,420
Now recall that the total purchase price

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,830
consisted of $207 million in new stock

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,290
that Tesla issued for this.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:33,470
But Tesla also converted to Tesla's stock a Maxwell

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,380
Technology equity compensation.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:43,400
So the total purchase price then was $215 million.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,780
And that consisted of tangible assets of $128 million,

12
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,680
intangible assets of $105 million.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,390
And then the difference was goodwill of $79 million

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,500
and liabilities of $97 million.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,000
