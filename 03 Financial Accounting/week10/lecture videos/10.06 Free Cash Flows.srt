PROFESSOR: Problem 6 asks about Tesla's free cash flow.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,560
Remember, from our discussions of the cash flow statement,

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,190
free cash flow is cash flow from operations

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,830
minus capital expenditures.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,500
And after you subtract off capital expenditures

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,840
from cash flow from operations, free cash flow, which in 2019,

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,840
was $973 million.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,400
That's how much money the Tesla could use to repay debt

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,658
or could use or give its stockholders a return.

10
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:35,158
