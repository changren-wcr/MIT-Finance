00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
PROFESSOR: So the next question, the eighth question,

1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,840
talks about how much lease principle

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,610
is due for finance leases.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,310
So here's a table that shows, starting

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,630
in 2021, how much is due for operating leases, how much is

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,050
due for finance leases, so that we see the two

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,700
totals there in 2020 and 2021.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,830
But remember, these lease payments

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,160
are partly principal and partly interest.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,870
So what we need to do is, assuming the interest

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,158
rate on these leases is 4 and 1/2%,

11
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:41,730
estimate how much interest there is on each of these payments.

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,790
Back that interest out and then come out

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,120
with a principal amount.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,020
So we're assuming that there's 4.5% interest.

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,740
Notice that the total present value of the leases

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,750
is $1.618 billion.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:02,940
So interest on the leases in 2020 is $73 million.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,640
So that tells us the principal on the leases that are

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,850
due in 2020 is $401 million.

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,300
Similarly, if we roll this forward one

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,480
more year, the next year, the principal of $1.618 billion

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,190
will have been reduced by $401 million.

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,650
We take 4 and 1/2% of that.

24
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,770
That's $55 million in interest.

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,320
That tells us that the principal in 2021 is $423 million.

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,440
And then just as a reminder, so when

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,420
we talked about finance leases, we had an amortization table.

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,370
Here's an amortization table I've

29
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,410
created to put this on a more familiar format for you

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,770
so that we have our beginning lease liability of $1.618

31
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,710
billion in 2020.

32
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,780
That's column B there.

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,880
Our interest expense on that at 4 and 1/2% is $73 million.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,560
The lease payment, which is given in the prior table,

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,440
is $474 million.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,070
So that tells us the principal reduction is $401 million.

37
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,320
That's column E.

38
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,010
And then column F tells us that the remaining principal

39
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,230
at the end of 2020 is $1.217 billion.

40
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,590
And the rest of the table rolls on from there.

41
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,370
So that's just a more familiar way for you

42
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,450
to think of the lease amortization.
