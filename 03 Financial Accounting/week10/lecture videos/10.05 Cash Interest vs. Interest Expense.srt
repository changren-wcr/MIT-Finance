PROFESSOR: Related to the previous problem, problem 5

1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,760
ask how much Tesla's interest expense was in 2019.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,270
First of all, how much was the interest expense?

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,960
And we can see from the income statement, it was $685 million.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:23,640
By contrast, how much interest did Tesla pay in cash in 2019?

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,980
That was only $455 million.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,190
We can pick that up from the bottom of the cash flow

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,450
statement.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,980
The question is, why is the difference?

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,120
And then as we saw in the prior problem,

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,070
they have a lot of convertible debt

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,620
that's treated as discount bonds.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,890
And for that convertible debt, the interest expense

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,260
is much greater than the cash coupon or the cash interest.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,730
This table shows cash coupon and interest expense

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,980
for Tesla's convertible bonds.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,970
In 2019, we see that cash interest, which

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,580
is the top row there, is much smaller than total interest

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,360
expense, which is the bottom row.
