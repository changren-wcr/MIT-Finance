PROFESSOR: Another method to account for equity securities
is the consolidation method.
This method is used when a firm has more than 50% equity
stake of another firm.
Suppose firm A owns 55% of the shares of firm B. In this case,
firm firm a exhibits control over firm B.
We refer to firm A as the parent and firm B as the subsidiary.
GAAP requires that the parent reports
consolidated financial statements.
This means that the parent's balance sheet
must include the subsidiary's assets and liabilities,
and similarly for other financial statements,
such as the income statement or statement of cash flows.
