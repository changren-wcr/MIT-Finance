1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,120
PROFESSOR: From this slide, we'll cover investments.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,900
In this section, we refer to investments as debt securities

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,260
or equity securities for other business entities.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,570
Why do companies make investments and purchase

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,040
securities?

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,000
Cash is often referred to as unproductive asset.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,550
This is because cash by itself does not

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,970
generate high returns especially if interest rates are low.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,520
Mature companies therefore will often

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,820
invest in this cash in equity or debt securities

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,730
rather than hold them at a surplus.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,250
Because these securities are highly liquid

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,950
and have quoted market prices, GAAP

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,650
has stated that they be held on the balance sheet

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,810
at fair value.

16
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,970
Accounting for these investments depends

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,580
on many factors, including the investment

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,960
horizon, the ownership stake, and the nature of the security.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,920
Is it debt?

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,290
Or is it equity?

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,130
This diagram shows how much investment classifications

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,970
are used.

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,330
First, the securities are divided through how much

24
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,430
ownership that company has.

25
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,760
For majority ownership, consolidate purchase method

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,960
is used.

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,270
This accounting method we have covered in the previous slides.

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,450
For minority investments, their classification

29
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,970
is further divided into passive and securities

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,160
with significant influence.

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,370
Reclassify investments as securities with significant

32
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,900
influence if the ownership stake is between 20% and 50%.

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,630
This method uses the equity method.

34
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,580
We'll also cover in this recitation.

35
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,070
Under passive investments, which are securities

36
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,950
that the firm holds under 20% ownership,

37
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,170
there are three methods to use--

38
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,280
trading, available for sale, and held-to-maturity.

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,320
Each classification is determined

40
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,480
by the firm's discretion.

41
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,560
Trading and available for sale securities

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,160
follow the fair value method for accounting.

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,210
And held-to-maturity securities follow the cost method.

44
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,199
We'll go over each method in this section.

45
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,150
As mentioned in the previous slide,

46
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,880
investments with more than 50% ownership

47
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,610
uses consolidation method.

48
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,060
Investments between 20% to 50% ownership,

49
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,130
we use the equity method.

50
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,220
For passive investments under 20% ownership,

51
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,850
we have trading securities, available for sale security,

52
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,590
and held-to-maturity securities.

53
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,960
How should we account for any changes in market

54
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,980
value of the investments?

55
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,980
First, held-to-maturity securities

56
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,100
do not have any effect for both balance sheet and income

57
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,390
statement.

58
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,630
Second, available for sale securities, changes

59
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,730
in the market value affects the balance sheet

60
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,010
but does not affect the income statement.

61
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,830
We will show this in a couple of slides how this can be done.

62
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,580
Finally, for trading securities, changes in the market value

63
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,310
affects both the balance sheet and income statement.

64
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,920
To reiterate, changes in market value

65
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,740
affect the balance sheet for available for sale and trading

66
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,880
securities.

67
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,090
Changes in market value affect the income statement only

68
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,050
for trading securities.
