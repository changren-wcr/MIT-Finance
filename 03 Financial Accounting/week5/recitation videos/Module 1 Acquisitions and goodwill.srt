PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,230
Welcome to fifth recitation of the Financial Accounting course.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,900
In this recitation, we'll cover acquisitions

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,110
and goodwill and investments.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,360
What is mergers and acquisitions?

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,200
Companies often engage in business combinations

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,710
or acquire other firms to enhance their business.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,290
This is informally referred to as M&A activity.

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,310
For example, Facebook acquiring Instagram or Heinz merging with

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,480
Kraft Foods are some good instances of M&As.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,020
We will often use the term net assets.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,360
Net assets equals assets minus liability.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,920
Remember from the BSE that assets minus liabilities

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,600
equals equity.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,300
The question I hope to go through in this recitation

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,030
is, how do we account for acquisitions?

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,270
Under purchase accounting, the entire acquisition payment

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,290
is added to the acquirer's balance sheet and distributed.

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,540
We do this in three steps.

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,480
One, account for fair value of tangible assets

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,720
and liabilities, such as PPE, financial assets,

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,060
and other assets and liabilities.

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,720
Two, account for identifiable intangible assets,

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,610
such as customer relationships, trade names, and patents.

25
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,370
And three, put everything else under goodwill,

26
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,170
which is an intangible asset that

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,830
is not separately identifiable.

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,670
This essentially is a plug-in account,

29
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,420
where you classify everything else from the two items listed

30
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,710
above.

31
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,110
This procedure as a whole is called

32
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,430
allocating the purchase price.

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,150
Let's dig a little deeper on goodwill and intangibles.

34
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,790
If you see goodwill on the balance sheet,

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,220
it represents purchase goodwill.

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,220
Goodwill will occur on firm A's balance sheet

37
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,550
only of firm A acquired firm B and purchased at a higher price

38
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,580
the firm B's book value.

39
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,420
Firms cannot estimate and report their own goodwill.

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,120
Similarly, identifiable intangibles

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,460
on the balance sheet, such as patents,

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,610
are the result of a purchase from another company.

43
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,790
The only exception is certain software development costs.

44
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,870
Identifiable intangibles are subject to amortization, which

45
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,890
we assume zero salvage value.
