1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,130
PROFESSOR: Let's solve an example.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,170
Trek Company purchases 100 shares

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,840
of Stark Company for $10 each.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,060
This is a 30% stake.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,230
Report the transaction in BSE.

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,550
Cash decreases by $1,000, and investment increases by $1,000.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,170
A year later, Stark Company shares rise to $15 each.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,600
Trek Company does not sell any of their shares.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,940
Record the BSE.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,710
There's no effect on the balance sheet,

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,450
because equity method does not record unrealized gains.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,190
The following year, Stark Company

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,260
issues a dividend of $1 a share.

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,770
Cash increases by $100, 1 times $100.

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,040
Investment, on the other hand, decreases by $100

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,690
to account for the dividend.

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,490
And recall that dividends affect the investment account, but not

18
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,930
the retained earnings account.

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,560
The following day, Stark Company announces earnings of $1,000.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,450
Trek Company sells all of their shares for cash at $13 each.

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,250
There are two transactions here.

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,640
First, we need to account for the earnings of $1,000.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,610
Equity method requires us to multiply earnings

24
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,890
times the percentage stake the company is holding,

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,740
which is 30%.

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,530
Therefore investment increases by $300

27
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,710
and retained earnings increase by $300.

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,680
The second transaction we need to realize

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,320
is that Trek Company should record

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,390
the selling of the securities.

31
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,070
Since we received $1,300 in cash by selling equity securities,

32
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,130
cash increases by $1,300.

33
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,000
On the other hand, investment decreases by 1,200.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,250
This is after accounting minus $100

35
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,670
from dividends and plus $300 from earnings.

36
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,060
Retained earnings increases by $100

37
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,170
to account for the realized gain.
