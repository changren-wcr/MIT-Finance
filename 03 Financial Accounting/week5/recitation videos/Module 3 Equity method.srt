00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,340
PROFESSOR: What about equity investments?

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,220
In this section, we'll go over the equity

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,630
method, a common method to account for equity securities.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,940
In one of the previous slides, I mentioned

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,790
that equity method is used for equity securities

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,790
with 20% to 50% ownership.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,190
When accounting using the equity method,

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,160
changes in market prices do not affect the balance sheet

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,640
or the income statement unless the loss or gain

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,470
has been realized.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,670
This is similar to the treatment for available for sale

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,400
securities.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,880
Dividends received affect the investment account directly

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,030
but not retained earnings.

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,030
Also, the company's earnings affect both the investment

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,810
account and retained earnings.
