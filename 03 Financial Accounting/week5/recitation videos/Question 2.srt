00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,580
PROFESSOR: Question is on held to maturity debt securities.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,450
Let's say Trek Company purchases 100 par bonds with a face value

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,150
of $10, which is a 10% stake.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,450
Trek intends to hold the bonds until maturity.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,810
What is the balance sheet equation for this transaction?

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,110
Cash decreases by $1,000, and investment increases by $1,000.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,060
A year later, bonds are trading at $15 each.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,990
Trek Company does not sell.

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,340
What is the BSE?

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,980
Before we go to the BSE equation,

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,940
we need to know what kind of security

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,510
this should be classified as.

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,670
As mentioned in the question, Trek

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,460
intends to hold the bonds until maturity

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,640
and they have 10% stake.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,340
Therefore, this would be classified as held to maturity

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,990
securities.

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,840
Knowing this, I mentioned held to maturity securities

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,000
does not have any effect on balance sheet,

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,830
despite any changes in market value.

21
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,840
Therefore, there is no change in the balance sheet equation.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,280
The following year, the bonds issue a coupon payment of $100.

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,640
Record this under the BSE equation.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,700
Cash increases by $100 because Trek

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,520
received $100 of interest income,

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,020
and retained earnings increase by $100.

27
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,050
At maturity, the bonds are trading at $10.

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,810
Trek Company receives back principle in cash.

29
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,850
Trek Company received the cash at maturity,

30
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,600
so cash increases by the principal amount, which

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,620
is $1,000, and investment decreases by the same amount,

32
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,870
$1,000.
