1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:01,960
PROFESSOR: In this question, we'll

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,610
cover available for sale, or AFS, securities.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,520
Trek Company purchased 100 bonds with a face value

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,000
of $10, same 10% stake.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,020
But instead, they classified the bonds as available for sale.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,860
Record the balance sheet equation.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,000
Again, cash decreases by $1,000 and investment increases

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,080
by $1,000.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,350
A year later, bonds are trading at $15 each.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,409
Trek Company does not sell.

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,900
Since this is available for sale securities,

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,030
the unrealized gains are reflected

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,260
on the balance sheet equation, but not on income statement.

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,700
Investment increases by $500, and other comprehensive income,

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,630
or OCI, increases by $500.

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,970
This OCI account does not affect income statement.

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,030
The following year, the bonds issue a coupon payment

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,080
totaling $100.

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,840
Record the B. Again, cash increases by $100,

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,720
and retained earnings increased by $100

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,410
to reflect the interest income.

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,310
The following day, bonds are trading at $13 each.

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,055
Trek Company sells all of their bonds for cash.

24
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:17,670


25
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,400
Again, cash increases by $1,300.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,360
Investment, on the other hand, decreases by $1,500.

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,460
OCI also decreases by $500, because the $500 increase was

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,800
reflected on the OCI account.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,320
In contrast to trading securities,

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,620
retained earnings increased by $300.

31
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,070
Why is this?

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,270
This is because OCI does not affect income statement.

33
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,030
And for AFS securities, you record only

34
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,900
realized gains or losses on the income statement.

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,380
In reality, Trek bought the bonds at $10

36
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,080
and sold them at $13 each.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,030
So the realized gain itself is $300.
