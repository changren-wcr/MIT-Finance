00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,800
PROFESSOR: Let's solve an example.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,640
AT&T acquired 100% of DirecTV stake,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,950
and AT&T needs to make adjustments,

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,440
using the consolidation method.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,820
The following table is AT&T and DirecTV's balance sheet post

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,480
acquisition, and both, unconsolidated,

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,460
reported in fair values.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,670
How does AT&T's consolidate a balance sheet look

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,140
like post acquisition?

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,260
After consolidation, AT&T increases

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,650
assets and liabilities by the fair value amount.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,910
For example, cash increases by $5,061, which

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,530
is DirecTV's cash holdings.

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:48,350
Other tangible assets increased by $14,943, and so on.

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,400
However, we need to adjust for the original investments

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,230
in DirecTV.

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,000
Here, in AT&T's unconsolidated balance sheet post acquisition,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,530
reports the book value of net assets of DirecTV,

19
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,100
which is $47,763 under investment

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,530
in DirecTV in the fourth row of this table.

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,980
The consolidation method requires to adjust this amount,

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,830
because we already incorporated all other assets

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,250
and liabilities into the consolidated AT&T balance

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,670
sheet.

25
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:28,180
Therefore, we subtract $47,763 from AT&T's balance sheet,

26
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,700
which used to be recorded under AT&T's unconsolidated balance

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,900
sheet.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,800
The final value of total assets of AT&T's consolidated balance

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,190
sheet is $402,737, and the book value of net assets

30
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,500
is $120,886.

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,000
