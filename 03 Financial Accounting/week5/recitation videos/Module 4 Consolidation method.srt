PROFESSOR: Another method to account for equity securities

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,410
is the consolidation method.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,150
This method is used when a firm has more than 50% equity

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,760
stake of another firm.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,310
Suppose firm A owns 55% of the shares of firm B. In this case,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,640
firm firm a exhibits control over firm B.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,220
We refer to firm A as the parent and firm B as the subsidiary.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,500
GAAP requires that the parent reports

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,990
consolidated financial statements.

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,300
This means that the parent's balance sheet

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,840
must include the subsidiary's assets and liabilities,

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,300
and similarly for other financial statements,

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,880
such as the income statement or statement of cash flows.
