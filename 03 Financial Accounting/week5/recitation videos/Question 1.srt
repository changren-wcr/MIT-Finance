00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,990
PROFESSOR: Question one-- acquisition.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,400
Suppose Big Company buys Little Company for $2,000.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,400
The following is Little Company's balance sheet.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,050
What is the balance sheet equation

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,140
to account for this acquisition?

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,030
In order to solve this question, we

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,640
need to know more information.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,910
First, we need to know what the fair value of tangible assets

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,680
and liabilities are.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,980
Fair value means what the acquirer valued or paid

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,940
for these assets and liabilities as opposed to the book value.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,630
We first know that the Big Company paid $2,000

13
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,640
to acquire Little Company.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,430
The market value of net assets of the Little Company

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,420
therefore is $2,000.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,300
In this problem, let's assume Little Company's land

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,220
is valued at $800 although the book value is $300.

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,620
All other tangible assets and liabilities

19
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,940
have not changed in value.

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,510
Therefore, the market value of tangible assets

21
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,000
after the merger becomes $1,150 rather than $650.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,090
This is because all other assets remain the same value,

23
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,500
but land was valued at $800 instead of $300.

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,280
This $800 is the market value after the merger.

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,420
Total liabilities stayed the same at $450.

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,300
We have the market value of liabilities and equity--

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,050
$450 and $2,000 respectively.

28
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,870
We can also obtain the market value of total assets

29
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,640
of Little Company.

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,390
This is $2,450.

31
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,580
For our second step, we need to know

32
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,210
what the identifiable intangible assets are valued at.

33
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,690
Let's assume Big Company identified intangible assets

34
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,340
valued at $100.

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,760
Our final step requires solving for goodwill.

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,010
We subtract tangible assets and intangible assets,

37
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,100
which we identified previously from the total assets.

38
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,580
Solving for goodwill gives us $1,200 on goodwill.

39
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,430
Again, goodwill works like a plug-in value

40
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,259
after considering the market values

41
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,940
of tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets.

42
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,530
We now have to identify the balance sheet equation.

43
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,420
The balance sheet equation to record

44
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,040
the acquisition of Little Company

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,960
becomes cash decreases by $1,900.

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,590
Accounts receivable increase by $200.

47
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,100
Inventory increases by $50.

48
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,290
Land increases by $800.

49
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,570
Intangibles or intangible assets increases by $100.

50
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,520
Goodwill increases by $1,200, accounts payable by $50.

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,970
And long-term debt increases by $400.

52
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,850
Here, note that cash decreases by $1,900 instead of $2,000

53
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,790
because Big Company paid $2,000 in cash

54
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:03,210
but Little Company had $100 in cash so net $1,900 decrease.

55
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,900
Suppose Big Company previously had $1,000 of goodwill

56
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,310
on their balance sheet.

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,770
What is the new amount of goodwill on the balance sheet?

58
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,350
If Big Company had $1,000 goodwill,

59
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,410
and acquiring Little Company adds $1,200,

60
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,140
so the final goodwill amount for Big Company is $2,200.
