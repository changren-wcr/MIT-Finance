00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,170
PROFESSOR: Question 3 deals with debt securities

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,090
classified as trading.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's say Trek Company now purchased 100 par bonds,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,920
with a face value of $10, with 10% stake, as before.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,050
Trek classifies the bonds as trading.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,740
Record the B.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,040
This transaction is the same as held for maturity securities.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,280
Cash decreases by $1,000, and investment

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,890
increases by the same amount.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,430
A year later, bonds are trading at $15 each.

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,560
Trek Company does not sell.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,360
Record the BSE.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,840
In this case, since the bonds are classified as trading,

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,810
we need to record the gains and increase in market value,

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,760
although the company did not sell.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,790
To reflect the increases in market value for trading

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,910
securities, investment increases by $500

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,310
because the market value per bond increased to $15 from $10.

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,420
On the other hand, retained earnings increases by $500

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,840
and is recorded as an increase in unrealized gains.

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,160
Later, the bonds issue a coupon payment totaling $100.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,950
As before, cash increases by $100,

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,100
and retained earnings increase by $100, which is

24
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,400
classified as interest income.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,940
The following day, bonds are trading at $13 each.

26
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,170
And Trek Company sells all of their bonds for cash.

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,360
Record the BSE.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,420
Since trucks sold all of their bonds at $13,

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,240
cash increases by $1,300.

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,660
Investments decreased by $1,500, because the book

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,050
value of the bonds was recorded at $1,500.

32
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,340
Finally, to balance the equation out, we record negative $200

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,160
in retained earnings and classify this as realized loss.
