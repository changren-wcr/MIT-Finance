00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
PROFESSOR: Let's talk about accounting now for available

1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,860
for sale.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,660
So we're going to use the same examples.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:15,580
Eva buys 100 Attila bonds for $100,000, gets a dividend.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,940
Available for sale and trading securities

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,280
give identical treatment for purchase and receipts

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,020
of dividends.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,810
So this accounting is exactly alike.

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,760
Now, the difference is going to be here.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,540
Now the bonds have gone up by $5,000.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,160
So marketable securities is going to go up by $5,000.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,570
But we want to keep this gain off of our income statement.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,700
So we're not going to put it in a retained earnings.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,640
We're going to put it in the holding tank, which

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,930
is other comprehensive income.

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,400
So we have an increase in value on our balance sheet.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,410
But that increase in value does not show up in income

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,005
because we're putting it in other comprehensive income.

18
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:06,820


19
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,860
So prior to the sale available for sale securities,

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,340
increases in value are not in retained earnings.

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,990
They're not in income.

22
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,795
Instead, we're keeping them in other comprehensive income.

23
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:22,160


24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,150
A year later, the bond price has dropped.

25
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,880
So the value of the bonds is $102,000.

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,640
We're going to draw marketable securities.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,070
And again, to balance the balance sheet equation,

28
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,290
we're going to put the amount into

29
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,655
other comprehensive income.

30
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:44,100


31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,100
And then finally, the bonds are worth $111,000.

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,650
Eva is going to sell all these bonds.

33
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,730
And notice this is very similar to the sale of property, plant,

34
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,040
and equipment.

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,490
We're going to recognize cash.

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,030
We're going to close the balance of marketable securities.

37
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,320
We're going to close the balance of other comprehensive income,

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,930
and then we're going to solve for the gain or the loss

39
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,800
on the transaction.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,420
So cash goes up by $111,000.

41
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,860
We close out marketable securities of $102,000.

42
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,050
We close out other comprehensive income of $2,000,

43
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,330
and then we solve for the realized gain of $11,000.

44
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,430
And notice that this realized gain

45
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:43,100
is $9,000 that we made in 2006 plus the $2,000

46
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,910
that we made in prior years that we had stored

47
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,200
in other comprehensive income.

48
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,990
So that illustrates the difference

49
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,560
between accounting for trading securities

50
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,780
and accounting for available for sale securities.
