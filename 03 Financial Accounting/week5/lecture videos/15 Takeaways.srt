1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,570
PROFESSOR: So takeaways, we got two takeaway slides

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,350
for this investment section.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,170
So passive investments, we mark 'em to market.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,720
With some not complete control, we're

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,760
going to do the equity method, which we just

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,860
saw was favorable.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,380
And if we got more than 50% ownership,

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,340
we're going to consolidate.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,330
So whether it's equity or consolidated

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,970
makes a big difference on the appearance of the statements.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,509
And as we saw, the leverage ratios

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,960
can be very different depending on whether you're

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,770
using equity method on your sub or whether you're

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,280
consolidating your sub

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,430
And then when there's changes in market values

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,190
as we talked about at the beginning of this class,

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:54,200
accountants make market valuation adjustments.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,140
So for inventory and PP&E, accounts

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,180
use lower cost to market in the US.

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,590
That just means if the market value of the property, plant

21
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,250
and equipment say falls below the book value

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,930
as we talked about in the class on property, plant

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,160
and equipment, we're going to impair the property, plant

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,480
and equipment.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,060
So for large investments, 20% plus either under the equity

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,825
method of accounting or under the consolidation

27
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:24,200
method of accounting, we're going

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,870
to use lower of cost or market.

29
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,980
Whereas for passive investments, either trading securities

30
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,840
or available for sale securities,

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,740
we're going to use mark to market accounting.

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,720
And the type of security is going

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,660
to determine the effect on income.

34
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,120
Trading securities realized gains

35
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,120
are going to be reported as part of net income.

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,220
Unavailable for sale securities, unrealized gains and losses

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,670
are going to be part of other comprehensive income

38
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,470
until they become realized gains and losses.
