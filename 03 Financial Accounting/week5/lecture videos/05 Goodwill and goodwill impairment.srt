1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,670
PROFESSOR: Now we want to talk about goodwill.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,680
So we've talked about it as goodwill

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,020
as the part of the purchase price

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,010
after you've allocated value to the tangible assets

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,070
and liabilities, after you've allocated values

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,440
to the intangible, identifiable assets.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,950
So what assets are at least, in principle,

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,490
included in the goodwill balance?

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,790
So it's intangibles that are not separately identifiable.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,220
And these are things like synergies, which

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,040
is, by nature, sort of vague.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,830
A better way to think about synergies

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,370
is, if we put AT&T and DirecTV together,

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,380
maybe profits will go up in the future.

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,400
So these future profit increases, maybe we

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,950
have ability to grow in the future,

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,660
and we're also acquiring employees.

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,110
So what happens to the goodwill going forward?

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,910
So, by US GAAP and by IFRS, we're

20
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,940
going to check the goodwill and evaluate it

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,440
for impairment annually.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,350
And we'll talk about how this is done in the next slide.

23
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,070
So goodwill impairment is a write down or a reduction

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,360
in the value of goodwill.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,740
And we're going to do this if management assesses

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,110
that the fair value of the goodwill or the market

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,300
value of the goodwill is less than the book value

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,550
the goodwill.

29
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,950
And then the intuition for this is just,

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,140
as always in this class, it's lower of cost or market.

31
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,820
So the cost of the goodwill is a book value.

32
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,010
We're going to check whether the market value is above or below

33
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,260
the cost of the goodwill.

34
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,970
Where does the fair value of the good will come from?

35
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,790
Well, this is a management estimate.

36
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,910
And it's very hard for outsiders to know

37
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,300
whether managers are estimating these things appropriately

38
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,910
or not.

39
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,088
What happens when goodwill is impaired?

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,380
So we're going to write down the value of the goodwill.

41
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,210
So the asset is going to go down in value.

42
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,479
And then we'll have a loss in our income statement.

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,630
We'll see some examples of this coming up.

44
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,260
So, coming back to Autonomy, which

45
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,420
was bought by Hewlett-Packard company in 2011,

46
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,690
here's Hewlett-Packard's discussion of the purchase

47
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,370
price allocation.

48
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,530
So Hewlett-Packard's largest acquisition in fiscal 2011

49
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,300
was Autonomy.

50
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,960
Our fair value consideration, so what we paid for Autonomy,

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,530
was $11 billion in cash.

52
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,355
And, when we bought it, we recorded $6.6 billion

53
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:45,990
worth of goodwill.

54
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:53,880
And then we recorded intangible assets of $4.6 billion.

55
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,690
So, using this little snippet from the financial statements,

56
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,510
we can see that the balance sheet equation

57
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,140
entry was we paid $11 billion in cash for it.

58
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,390
That was the purchase price.

59
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,870
What we got was $6.6 billion in goodwill.

60
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,330
We got $4.6 billion in identifiable intangibles.

61
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,310
And then, to balance the balance sheet equation,

62
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,360
we can figure out that the fair value of net assets

63
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,380
added was minus $0.2 billion.

64
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,350
So everything is fine.

65
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,510
This is 2011.

66
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,440
A year later, also in Hewlett-Packard's

67
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,190
annual report, they say we're writing down

68
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,880
the goodwill associated with the Autonomy reporting unit.

69
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,000
And it's because our projected operating results of Autonomy

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,790
include accounting improprieties,

71
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,420
incomplete disclosures, and misrepresentations

72
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,720
at Autonomy that occurred prior to the Autonomy acquisition.

73
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,050
So, in other words, the future profits

74
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,750
that we thought we were going to get from Autonomy

75
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,330
are much lower than they were.

76
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,940
And, because we based our goodwill estimate

77
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,130
on those future profits, we're going

78
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,430
to have to write down or impair the goodwill

79
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,240
to reflect the fact that future profits are much lower

80
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,170
than anticipated.

81
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,860
So let's look at how this plays out

82
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,090
in the balance sheet equation.

83
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,350
So Hewlett-Packard, at the acquisition date,

84
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,530
created $6.6 billion of goodwill related to Autonomy.

85
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,580
It decides that the fair value of that goodwill is zero.

86
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,230
Remember, we're writing down $8.8 billion.

87
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,950
Where's the rest of that?

88
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,430
Or the $2.2 billion is probably coming

89
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,830
from identifiable or amortizable purchased intangible assets.

90
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,920
So our balance sheet equation entries

91
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,350
are we write down the goodwill asset by $6.6 billion.

92
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,950
We take an impairment charge in income of $6.6 billion.

93
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,990
We write down the intangible assets by $2.2 billion.

94
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,580
And we take an impairment charge on the intangible assets

95
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,370
of $2.2 billion.

96
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,110
So that's example one.

97
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,730
So HP ended up overpaying for Autonomy

98
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:36,540
because, at least as HP alleges, Autonomy was committing fraud.

99
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,390
Once Hewlett-Packard understood the fraud,

100
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:45,440
they had to write down the value of the Autonomy investment.

101
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,010
Here's another one that's more recent.

102
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,520
So, back in 2005, Procter & Gamble

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,300
bought Gillette, which is the shaving business.

104
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,380
OK, now they're writing down the value of the Gillette brand

105
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,510
by $8 billion.

106
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,190
And the executives attributed this write down

107
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,680
to lower shaving frequency.

108
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,000
Now does this make sense?

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,840
So, if you look around, at least in the US,

110
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,340
probably half of men of shaving age have beards now.

111
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,950
So they don't shave anymore, OK?

112
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,600
And so Gillette finds that the market for shaving products

113
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,320
has shrunk by 11% the past five years.

114
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,900
It's got competition from internet companies like Dollar

115
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,330
Shave Club and Harry's.

116
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,510
And, as a result of this, its sales

117
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,750
have declined in 11 of 12 quarters.

118
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,730
So sales come down.

119
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,480
Profits come down.

120
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,890
That means that the value of that goodwill

121
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,120
comes down as well.

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,800
So here's how P&G reflects this in its income statement.

123
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,160
So we've got this is a December 2019 income statement.

124
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,330
We've got sales, cost of goods sold, SG&A,

125
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,340
and then the goodwill write down of $8.345 billion.

126
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,750
And then they also show it in their balance sheet

127
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,410
where they show goodwill and intangible assets.

128
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,530
So P&G is a company that's always doing acquisitions.

129
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,070
So it's got beauty segment.

130
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,280
It's got a grooming segment where Gillette is.

131
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,970
It's got health care, feminine care, et cetera.

132
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:39,000
And all this growth came through acquisitions with goodwill.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And P&G is showing you how it writes down

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,540
the value of goodwill by $6.7 billion in 2019.

135
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Now, coming back briefly to DirecTV,

136
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,340
this is an article from 2018 CNBC that

137
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:08,840
talks about how DirecTV reported a staggering loss of 350,000

138
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,880
net subscribers.

139
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,730
This quarterly net loss is about 2%

140
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,590
of total subscribers at that time.

141
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,580
And, if we annualize it, then it's about 8%

142
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,120
on an annualized basis.

143
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,720
And, of course, we know why this is happening.

144
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,830
Because consumers or viewers, they're cutting the cord.

145
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,930
They don't want TV packages.

146
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,070
They don't want cable.

147
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,960
They don't want DirecTV.

148
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,860
They want cheaper streaming video like Netflix and Hulu.

149
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,900
Now, because of this, you might expect an impairment of DirecTV

150
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,360
goodwill, but, at least through 2019, this has not happened.

151
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,510
So, even though the news on the DirecTV unit is bad,

152
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,565
management still hasn't written down the DirecTV goodwill.

153
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:04,680
And, remember, this is a management estimate,

154
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,990
and this impairment is somewhat discretionary.
