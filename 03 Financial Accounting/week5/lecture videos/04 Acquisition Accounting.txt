0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
PROFESSOR: So under purchase accounting,

1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,370
the whole acquisition payment, which is, again, $47.8 billion,

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,230
is added to the acquirer's balance sheet.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,620
And we're going to distribute it across the fair value

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,630
tangible assets and liabilities, identifiable intangibles,

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,400
and goodwill.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,120
Remember, our total purchase price is $47.8 billion.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,740
We're paying this purchase price with cash of $14.4 billion.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,140
And we're issuing new stock of $33.4 billion.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,900
So that's the acquisition payment.

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,020
Now, what did we get for that acquisition payment?

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,450
Well, we got fair value intangible assets

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,280
of $20 billion, fair value of liabilities about $43 billion.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,110
We got our intangibles of $36.2 billion.

14
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,970
And then we plug for what we saw for goodwill.

15
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,520
So that's the balance sheet equation

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,410
under purchase accounting.

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,040
And this shows how AT&T's balance sheet

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,830
changes as a result of the DirecTV acquisition.

19
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,880
So notice that in our calculations here,

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,190
we had book value before the merger, book value

21
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,320
of net assets, was minus 3,463.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,060
Market value after the merger was $47.88 billion.

23
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,530
And you can see all the changes in the assets and liabilities,

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,460
which are the acquisition adjustments we just discussed.

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,370
So what companies will often show

26
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,070
you is a pro-forma combined balance sheet.

27
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,660
So they'll show you AT&T right before the merger.

28
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:56,050
So it's a big company with $87.5 billion in net assets.

29
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,960
DirecTV, a smaller company, with minus $3.5 billion

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,090
in net assets.

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,510
There's a column there showing the acquisition payment,

32
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,210
a column there showing the changes

33
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,700
in the value of the assets and liabilities.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,460
And then that gives you the pro-forma balance sheet of AT&T

35
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:24,240
pro forma for having executed this merger.

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,680
So in a more familiar example, Facebook back in 2014

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,160
spent $18 billion to buy WhatsApp.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,950
WhatsApp was a private company which

39
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,370
had mainly an international texting service.

40
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,870
And you can see the purchase price allocation.

41
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,860
About $2 billion went to intangible assets

42
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,170
in terms of acquired users.

43
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,570
There was a little bit that went to trade name,

44
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,630
acquire technology, and other.

45
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,510
Most of the purchase price went to $15 billion

46
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,630
worth of goodwill.

47
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,170
So right after the acquisition, Facebook

48
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,390
put out a pro-forma combined balance

49
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:14,300
sheet as of June 30, 2014.

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,250
And the first column of the balance sheet

51
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,360
shows Facebook's historical financial statements,

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,360
shows WhatsApp's historical financial statements.

53
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,010
Notice what a tiny little company WhatsApp was.

54
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,850
Then it shows how much it paid for the tiny little company,

55
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,530
which was close to $18 billion.

56
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,120
And then it shows what it got for the tiny little company,

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,750
WhatsApp, which was $18 billion, mainly

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,600
goodwill, and also intangible assets.

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,820
And then the final column shows the pro-forma combined balance

60
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,430
sheet, so what Facebook would look

61
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,940
like after the WhatsApp acquisition

62
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,040
had been consummated.

63
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,770
Now, one sort of note here.

64
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,710
Those of you that know don't this,

65
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,770
was an incredibly successful acquisition.

66
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,500
So by acquiring those users, which

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,190
were a different set of users than Facebook ordinarily had,

68
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,800
mainly international users, Facebook

69
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,540
was able to cross-sell Facebook to those international users.

70
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,450
And this was a huge win for Facebook.

71
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,080
So the goodwill here of $15 billion

72
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,850
is probably an understatement of the amount of synergies

73
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,950
that Facebook created here.

74
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,480
And I want to say that because we're

75
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,220
going to get into several examples

76
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,740
here where we're writing off goodwill

77
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,010
because the acquisitions did not turn out so well.

78
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,180
Now, just continuing on for a second on purchase accounting,

79
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,670
so post acquisition, basically what happens

80
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,420
is you add the income and revenue of the acquirer

81
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,650
and target.

82
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,260
And you make sure to eliminate any kind of intercompany sales.

83
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,150
Income in the later years is going

84
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,360
to be reduced by if you've written up the property, plant,

85
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,590
and equipment, so you may have some extra depreciation.

86
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,640
And then you've written up the intangibles,

87
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,090
so you'll have extra amortization

88
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,460
charges on those intangibles.

89
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,300
And then later on we'll talk about goodwill impairments,

90
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,400
if those things happen.

91
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,000
So again back to Facebook, so Facebook is saying its purchase

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,590
price allocation is mainly going to acquired users, $2 billion;

93
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,250
and to goodwill, $15 billion.

94
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:49,780
Now, it's also showing how it's going to amortize

95
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,470
those intangible assets.

96
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,770
So for example preliminary fair value of acquired users

97
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,404
was $2 billion.

98
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:03,920
We're going to estimate a useful life of that with no salvage

99
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,930
value of seven years.

100
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,910
And you can see how the 289 per year comes to be calculated.

101
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,760
So Facebook and companies will also put out a pro-forma income

102
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,000
statement.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,520
So for the six months ended 6/30/2014,

104
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,640
first we see Facebook's income statement.

105
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,350
Then we see WhatsApp's income statement.

106
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,190
Notice that WhatsApp is losing lots of money

107
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,470
on almost no sales.

108
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,290
Then we see the pro-forma adjustments.

109
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,270
And those pro-forma adjustments are

110
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,300
going to include the amortization of intangibles

111
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,090
we were just looking at on the prior slide.

112
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,810
And then it shows Facebook's pro-forma income statement.

113
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,650
And notice as a result of this acquisition,

114
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:58,950
Facebook's net income went from $1.4 billion to $0.7 billion.

115
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,100
So its net income got cut in half.

116
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,360
But over time, again, this was a hugely successful acquisition,

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,620
and the profits came in over time.
