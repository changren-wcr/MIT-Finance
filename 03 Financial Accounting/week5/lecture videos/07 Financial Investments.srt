1
00:00:00,223 --> 00:00:02,140
PROFESSOR: So for the remainder of this class,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,050
we're going to talk about financial investments.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,920
And we'll come at the end of this section

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,640
to realize that acquisitions are a special case

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,260
of financial investments.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,350
But we're going to broaden our focus a little bit.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,680
So our remaining agenda is to talk about when accounting

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,380
departs from transactions-based or historical cost model

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,110
and moves towards market-driven valuations.

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,140
We're going to talk about how financial investments are

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,870
valued on company's balance sheet

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,380
and how these financial investments affect the income

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,510
statement and cash flow statement

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,290
when there are valuation adjustments.

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,110
So backing up to earlier in the course,

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,840
so we talked about a variety of transactions related to assets.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,720
And we've talked about implicitly

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,110
when and how are the market value of assets reflected

19
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,310
in financial statements.

20
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,870
Let's go back and do an example of PP&E. Let's

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:13,570
pretend like on the 1st of January, 2000,

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,420
Delta buys an airplane for $20 million.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,030
And let's assume for simplicity that it has no salvage value

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,530
and a 10-year useful life.

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,510
So what transactions does it record in 2000?

26
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,110
So cash is going to go down by $20 million.

27
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,240
We're going to put the plane on our balance sheet

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,990
at $20 million.

29
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,600
What else is going to happen?

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,980
We're going to charge depreciation of $20 million

31
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,930
divided by 10 years.

32
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,420
So depreciation expense will be $2 million a year.

33
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,220
Accumulated depreciation will go up.

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,580
And then we'll have the expense for $2 million,

35
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,380
a depreciation expense.

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,720
Now a year later, let's pretend that Delta sells

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,310
this airplane for $20 million.

38
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,820
What's going to happen then?

39
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,210
We're going to get $20 million worth of cash.

40
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,430
What's going to happen to PP&E?

41
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,320
It's going to go down by $20 million.

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,490
What's going to happen to accumulated depreciation?

43
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,740
It's going to go down by $2 million.

44
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,990
And then we'll solve for the gain or loss.

45
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,020
So cash goes up.

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,840
Property, plant, and equipment goes down.

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,610
Accumulated depreciation goes down.

48
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,150
So we're getting cash, $20 million,

49
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,012
for an asset that has a net book value of $18 million.

50
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:42,470
So we're going to have a $2 million

51
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,120
gain on this transaction.

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,790
So notice at the beginning, we involved the market value

53
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,440
of the plane.

54
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,070
So we bought the plane for its market value at $20 million

55
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,910
at the time.

56
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,680
And at the end when we sell the airplane for $20 million,

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,260
we're also reflecting a change in market value.

58
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,280
But it's in the middle before the time

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,210
that we bought the PP&E and the time of the sale

60
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,700
that things get complicated.

61
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,930
Under US GAAP, the way that we handle this complication

62
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,220
is the lower of cost or market rule, or LCM.

63
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,070
So lower cost or market just says,

64
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,890
if the market value of an asset is

65
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,320
less than the book value of an asset,

66
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,460
then the firm must reduce the book value of the asset

67
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,360
and recognize a loss in the income statement.

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,110
And remember, we talked about this

69
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,510
in terms of the impairment of property, plant, and equipment.

70
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,800
So if the market value of property, plant, and equipment

71
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,790
is less than its book value, we impair the book value

72
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,660
of the asset.

73
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,430
And we recognize an impairment loss in the income statement.

74
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,640
On the other hand, under US GAAP,

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,790
if the market value of the asset goes above its book value,

76
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,290
we don't have to do any accounting transaction.

77
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,280
In fact, we cannot do any accounting transaction.

78
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,610
So PP&E is an example.

79
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,670
Inventory's another example.

80
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,310
In this part of this class, we're

81
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,880
going to talk about one set of accounting transactions

82
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,410
that deviate from lower costs or market principle, which

83
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,050
is passively owned financial assets.

84
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,110
So what are financial investments?

85
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,330
So some of you are familiar with common stock.

86
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,660
So you can buy stock in companies.

87
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,000
This is also called equity.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,570
Companies often issue bonds.

89
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,220
So you can buy corporate bonds, which

90
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,700
are bonds issued by companies.

91
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,010
There are also government bonds, which are

92
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,000
bonds issued by governments.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,250
It could be the US government.

94
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,710
It could be other governments.

95
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,990
It could be state governments.

96
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,350
And the accounting questions here is, number one,

97
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,300
should we recognize changes in the market value

98
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,770
of these financial investments on our balance sheet?

99
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,280
Now, notice the intuition for why we should is

100
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,610
that a lot of these things are traded in liquid markets.

101
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,220
And you can just look up the value

102
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,670
of a common stock in the newspaper or on the internet--

103
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,290
so makes sense to put market values of financial instruments

104
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,510
on our balance sheet.

105
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,660
And if the second question is yes, if we should put them

106
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,630
on our balance sheet, the second question is,

107
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:49,030
should we put changes in market value on our income statement?

108
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,870
Just as an aside as to how important financial investments

109
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,370
are to certain companies, let's look at this company.

110
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:03,060
So this is their balance sheet as of July of 2017.

111
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,380
Notice that this company has cash and cash equivalents

112
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,890
and short-term investments of about 16--

113
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,770
of about 20% of its assets.

114
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,160
And then it's got long-term investments of about 50%

115
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,520
of its assets.

116
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,600
So in total, this company has over 70% of its assets

117
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,750
in investments or in financial investments.

118
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,940
And when you guess what company is this,

119
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,910
you would think of it as maybe this is a bank,

120
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,040
or maybe it's an insurance company.

121
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,140
But this is actually Apple.

122
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,190
So Apple, which is a big computer manufacturer, almost

123
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,100
all of its on-balance sheet assets

124
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,720
are financial investments.

125
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,370
And then as an aside, why does a company like Apple

126
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,740
have so many financial investments?

127
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,460
So part of it is we're generating excess cash.

128
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,660
We might have that cash on hand for financial flexibility.

129
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,100
Things might go bad.

130
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,140
So we have rainy day money.

131
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,980
We might have it on hand to fund future R&D.

132
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,640
So lots of technology companies and drug companies,

133
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,630
when they come public initially, they raise all this money.

134
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,540
And then they keep this money on their balance sheet

135
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,010
to fund their money-losing operations until such time

136
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,030
ideally as they will start making money.

137
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,820
And then another big thing-- and this is what's going on with

138
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,580
Apple--

139
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,180
is because of tax considerations,

140
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,230
lots of US companies have cash that is trapped overseas.

141
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,060
Another reason for it is--

142
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,620
and we saw this with Amazon, building up cash so

143
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,660
that they could buy Whole Foods-- is maybe

144
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,690
were just saving cash, because we're going

145
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,850
to make a long-term investment.

146
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,770
We're going to buy another company.

147
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,880
We're going to expand.

148
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,480
Or we're going to do a strategic investment.
