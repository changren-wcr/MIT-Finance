1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,470
PROFESSOR: Final thing we want to do is consolidation.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:08,010
So we've done less than 20% ownership, which is passive.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,920
We've done 20% to 50% ownership, which is equity method.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,420
Once we get over 50%, we're thought to control the firm,

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,680
and we're going to consolidate it.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,600
So we'll work through this in a second,

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,140
but essentially what happens in consolidation accounting is

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,360
we're going to replace the investment

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,190
balance with the investee's assets and liabilities.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,010
We're going to replace the firm's portion of reported

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,050
income of the investee with the investee's sales and expenses.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,050
And then if the investee and the investor

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,180
sell stuff to each other, we're going

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,730
to eliminate intercorporate transactions.

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,560
Looking back to AT&T's acquisition of DIRECTV,

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,010
remember that this is what DIRECTV's balance sheet looked

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,060
like after the acquisition adjustments.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,550
AT&T's unconsolidated balance sheet after the acquisition

19
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:15,070
reflects that it made a $48 billion investment in DIRECTV

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,410
and paid for it with $14 billion in cash and $33 billion

21
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,295
in stock.

22
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:24,290


23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,350
The first two columns of this slide

24
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,400
shows the previous unconsolidated balance sheets

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,450
of AT&T and DIRECTV.

26
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,600
The third column shows the consolidating adjustments.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,930
We eliminate the investment in DIRECTV,

28
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,670
and we eliminate DIRECTV's book value.

29
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,320
Then we add all of DIRECTV's other assets and liabilities.

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,940
The final column then shows the consolidated balance sheets

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,870
of AT&T.

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,740
Now, a simpler example is this.

33
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,850
So let's suppose a parent owns 100% of a subsidiary,

34
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,660
so this is similar to our DIRECTV example.

35
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,860
So the parent shown in the far left column

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,740
has $10,000 of current assets.

37
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,710
It has the investment in the subsidiary.

38
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,550
It's got total assets of $24,000.

39
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,030
It's got liabilities of $8,000, which

40
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,680
are a third of total assets, or 33% of total assets.

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,020
It's got some contributed capital.

42
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,820
It's got some retained earnings.

43
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,760
And then again, its total liabilities and equities

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,610
are $24,000.

45
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:51,160
The subsidiary has total assets of $8,000,

46
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,680
of which half of those total assets

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,250
are book value in terms of contributed capital

48
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,740
and retained earnings.

49
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,270
Now, when we consolidate these, we're

50
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,436
going to eliminate the investment in the sub,

51
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,390
we're going to eliminate the subsidiary stockholders'

52
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,690
equity, so those are the consolidated adjustments,

53
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,330
and then we're just going to add across.

54
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,710
And notice that we're adding all the assets of the subsidiary,

55
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,210
and we're adding all the liabilities of the subsidiary,

56
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,800
and the effect of this is to raise our leverage measured

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,613
by liabilities to total assets.

58
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:33,030
We're going to raise that leverage

59
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,710
amount from 33% to 43%.

60
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,190
So now let's think about what happens

61
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,880
if the parent doesn't own 100% of the subsidiaries

62
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,140
in our last two examples.

63
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,310
So what happens if the parent owns less than 100%

64
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,090
of the subsidiary?

65
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,750
So we're going to continue to consolidate.

66
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,040
We control the subsidiary.

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,580
We're going to continue to consolidate,

68
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,950
but we're going to create this account called

69
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,090
non-controlling interest and equity of subsidiary

70
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,050
to represent the part that we don't control.

71
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,370
And then on our income statement,

72
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,700
we're also going to have a line item that's

73
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,279
called non-controlling interest and earnings of subsidiary.

74
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,560
Now, it's important to note here,

75
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,960
as with many things in accounting,

76
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,580
different firms are going to use different words.

77
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,460
So non-controlling interest is what

78
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,040
we're going to look at here, but you'll often

79
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,570
see the words minority interest, and non-controlling interest

80
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,290
and minority interest mean the exact same things

81
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,290
as each other.

82
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,600
So understand the concept, and then the vocabulary

83
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,620
will come along with it.

84
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,490
So going back to our earlier example,

85
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,820
now let's pretend that the parent owns only 50%

86
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,530
of the subsidiary.

87
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,050
And to do this in this context of this example,

88
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,470
we're going to pretend that the parent sells

89
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,380
50% of the subsidiary to somebody else.

90
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,720
So now the parent has $2,000 more cash

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,160
and that it's investment in the subsidiary is $2,000 less.

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,130
Then when we consolidate, so the column

93
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,830
showing consolidating adjustments,

94
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,450
we're going to remove the $2,000 investment in the subsidiary.

95
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,960
We're going to get rid of contributed capital.

96
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,100
We're going to get rid of retained earnings

97
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,430
of the subsidiary, but then we're

98
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,420
going to add this line item called non-controlling interest

99
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,500
that shows that somebody else owns half of our subsidiary.

100
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,110
And know what this did to our leverage ratio

101
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,270
because we're only consolidating half of those subsidiaries,

102
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,800
so to speak.

103
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,410
Our leverage ratio is only going to be 40% of assets as opposed

104
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,190
to 43% of assets in the prior slide.

105
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:12,250
Let's suppose now that we only own 49% of the subsidiary.

106
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,630
And to get here, we're just going

107
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,350
to adjust the prior slide.

108
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,960
We're going to pretend that the parent sells

109
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,220
1% of the subsidiary for $40 in cash.

110
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,620
So cash goes up by $40.

111
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,810
Investment in subsidiary goes down by $40.

112
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,090
Now, if the parent owns 49% of the sub,

113
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,300
are we now using consolidation--

114
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,980
are we now using consolidated accounting?

115
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,340
The answer is no because we don't own 50% any longer.

116
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,760
We only own 49%.

117
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,180
So now we're going to use equity method accounting

118
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,370
so that nothing comes on to our balance sheet,

119
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,010
as you can see in those adjustments

120
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,390
there, except for the investment in the sub.

121
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,910
And then notice now that the subsidiary, which

122
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,130
is more highly levered than the parent company is, none

123
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,010
of the subsidiary's liabilities come on balance sheet,

124
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,880
so our leverage ratio drops to 33%.

125
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,300
And this is what's known as Coca-Cola's 49% solution.

126
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,260
There's a little article about this here.

127
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,060
So Doug Ivester, who was the Chief Financial

128
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:38,610
Officer of Coke in 1986, devised the 49% solution.

129
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,900
And the 49% solution is instead of having control

130
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,170
of the bottling company and consolidating the assets

131
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,600
and liabilities on the balance sheet,

132
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,860
we're going to just take it back just a little bit

133
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,750
and have only 49% of the ownership,

134
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,390
so we no longer have to consolidate.

135
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,050
So we no longer put the assets and liabilities

136
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,590
on the balance sheet.

137
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,080
So the bottom line of the article there is here's

138
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,400
the magic.

139
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,040
By reducing its investments from 50% to 49%,

140
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,220
Coke lost billions in debt and a low-return, capital-hungry

141
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,830
business off of its books.

142
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:28,200
So this is creative accounting as practiced by Coca-Cola

143
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,740
in trying to get equity method accounting, which

144
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,220
is more favorable than consolidation accounting.
