PROFESSOR: Accounting for passive investments

1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,492
in an extended example--

2
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:08,200
so first we're going to do the accounting

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,260
for the security, which is a bond, as a trading security.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,260
And then we'll do the accounting as an available for sale

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,480
security so that we can see the differences in the accounting.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,420
So the SPY transaction--

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,710
so Attila is a company that has a bond that's

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,410
trading at $1,000 a bond.

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,205
Eva is a company that buys 100 of these bonds.

10
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:36,750


11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,350
11 months later, Eva receives $1,250

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,580
in interest on the bonds, or $1,250 per bond.

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,430
A year later, Attila is now trading at $1,050 a bond.

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,410
Eva keeps the bonds.

15
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,870
A year after that, the bond price drops back to $1,020.

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,390
Eva still keeps the bonds.

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,560
Finally, a year after that, the bond price

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,010
goes up to $1,010 per bond.

19
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,680
And then Eva, at that point, sells all of the bonds.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,570
So first let's do the example where the accounting is

21
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,700
a trading security.

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,400
So we buy the bond.

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,070
We buy 100 bonds at $1,000 a bond.

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,930
So cash goes down $100,000.

25
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,470
And then we've got marketable securities, or the bonds,

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,850
of $100,000.

27
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,290
In November, we get interest.

28
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,260
So cash goes up.

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,850
And then we're going to recognize

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,102
interest income of $1,250.

31
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:51,200
One point on the third column on the chart

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,500
there, which is called OthCI, or other comprehensive income.

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,330
We'll see in a few minutes that this

34
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,120
is a stockholder's equity account that

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,400
does not affect net income.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,430
And it's used to record gains and losses

37
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:14,430
on available for sale securities, among other things.

38
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,010
A year later, Attila's gone up to $1,050 per bond.

39
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,830
So how much are the bonds worth at this point?

40
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,180
So 1,050 times 100, so the bonds are worth $105,000.

41
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,750
So to reflect that, we're going to increase

42
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,660
marketable securities by $5,000.

43
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,630
So now we've got marketable securities

44
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,730
that have a value of $105,000 on our balance sheet.

45
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,770
And then we're going to put a gain on our income statement.

46
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,550
And this is an unrealized gain, which

47
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,240
means that we haven't sold the bonds to realize the gain.

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,280
It's just a paper gain so far.

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,930
A year later, the bond price drops to $1,020.

50
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,950
So now the bonds are worth $102,000.

51
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,390
But we've got them on our balance sheet for $105,000.

52
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,850
So we're going to reduce marketable securities

53
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,860
by $3,000.

54
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,840
And then we've got an unrealized loss of $3,000.

55
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,080
Unrealized, again, means that we have not

56
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,740
realized the value in cash.

57
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,110
So once again, we're adjusting the security

58
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,270
to its market value, which is $102,000 now.

59
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,320
And then finally, when we look at the trading security,

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:50,550
on December 31, 2006, Attila is now trading at $1,010 per bond.

61
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,130
And Eva sells all of its bonds.

62
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:59,430
So 1,010 times 100 is $111,000 cash

63
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,220
that Eva receives from the bonds.

64
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,500
We clear out marketable securities, which

65
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,740
now has a value of $102,000.

66
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,180
And then we recognize a realized gain of $9,000.

67
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,390
So that's our illustration of a trading security.
