00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,790
PROFESSOR: Now we're going to talk about the equity method.

1
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,230
So going back to our chart, remember we've just

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,000
looked at passive investments.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,570
We talked about how to account for trading securities,

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,650
how they appear on our balance sheet, changes in value,

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,800
and how those changes in value appear in retained earnings

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,390
and net income.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,990
We talked about passive investments,

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,670
in terms of available for sale, how those changes in values

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,400
are going to appear on our assets

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,160
and are going to appear in other comprehensive income.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,860
And those passive investments occur

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:46,260
if the company owns less than 20% of the stock or the bond.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,820
Now we're going to talk about significant influence, where

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,550
you own more than 20% of the stock or the bond

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,460
but own less than 50%.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,240
Once you own 50%, you have control

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,040
and we're going to consolidate.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,200
Note that while trading securities

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,780
and available for sale securities

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,840
are carried on our balance sheet at fair value,

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,870
investments that are accounted for under the equity method

22
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,260
and under the consolidation method

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,770
are carried on our balance sheet at historic cost.

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,360
So let's look for significant influence

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,350
and look at the equity method.

26
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,370
So the equity method says, if a firm

27
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,210
exerts significant influence over the firm

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,600
that it's investing in, then the firm must use the equity

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,690
market.

30
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,480
So if you own more than 20% but less than 50%,

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,180
that implies that you have significant influence.

32
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,350
But you can have significant influence with less than 20%,

33
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,330
say, like if you have a board seat.

34
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,510
And just an example to motivate this,

35
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,960
Gilead, the pharmaceutical company,

36
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,570
says it's going to invest $1.1 billion

37
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:09,080
to increase its stake in the drug maker Galapagos.

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,660
And it's going to increase its stake to 22% from 12.3%.

39
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,140
And notice it is paying a premium over the average market

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,550
price to do this.

41
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,720
So it's going to now have influence over Galapagos.

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,500
It's going to get two seats on Galapagos board of directors.

43
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,510
And because of this, it has to pay

44
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,830
a premium in the marketplace.

45
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,890
So that's his motivation.

46
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,410
Now what we want to do is talk about the accounting

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,640
for this, which is called the equity method.

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,950
So there are four steps to the equity method.

49
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,680
And we'll work through a big example

50
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,910
of this in just a second.

51
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,900
So you initially record the investment at how much

52
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,740
you paid for it, the acquisition cost.

53
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,800
And then, when you have dividends or earnings,

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,650
you're going to adjust the book value of the investment

55
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,920
by our share, the investor's share of the dividends

56
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,450
and earnings.

57
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,140
And then we're going to record the investor's share of profit

58
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,660
on our income statement.

59
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,350
But dividends, unlike trading securities and unlike available

60
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,530
for sale securities, they're not going to have income effects.

61
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,740
But they're going to reduce our investment.

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,310
They do not give rise to dividend income.

63
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,930
So let's now look at an example.

64
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,320
So here's the equity method example.

65
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,730
So on January 1, 2010 Zsa Zsa purchased 1,000 shares

66
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,110
of Zoltan for $15 in cash.

67
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,690
And when it bought us 1,000 shares,

68
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,970
it represents a 30% ownership interest in Zoltan.

69
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,350
At the time, Zoltan's book value per share was $10.

70
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,420
Zsa Zsa is paying a premium.

71
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,650
It's paying $15 instead of $10 because it thinks

72
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,530
that Zoltan has some patents.

73
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,890
And those patents are not on the balance sheet,

74
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,440
but they're worth $5 a share.

75
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,270
The patents have a life of 10 years.

76
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:19,570
On June 30, 2010, Zsa Zsa got a dividend of $1 a share.

77
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,880
On December 31, 2010, Zoltan's common stock price

78
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,060
had risen to $13 per share.

79
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,240
And also on December 31, 2010, Zoltan reports its earnings

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,610
as $20,000.

81
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,560
And then in the final thing, on June 30, 2011,

82
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,680
Zsa Zsa is going to sell the shares of Zoltan

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,720
for $17 a share.

84
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,890
So let's work through each of these steps

85
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,840
in a stepwise fashion.

86
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,710
So the first one is we buy the shares on January 1, 2010.

87
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,290
So we buy 1,000 shares at $15 a share.

88
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,470
And this is a 30% interest in Zoltan,

89
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,130
so that it's greater than the 20% threshold

90
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,140
but less than the 50% threshold.

91
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,830
So we have to use equity method accounting.

92
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,780
So when we buy it, how much cash goes out?

93
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,290
So $15 times 1,000.

94
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,400
Cash goes down by $15,000.

95
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,910
Our investment in Zoltan goes up by $15,000 as well.

96
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,760
Second transaction, we receive a dividend of $1 a share.

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,220
So remember we have 1,000 shares.

98
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,600
So we get $1,000 worth of cash.

99
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,770
Now, remember, if this were a trading security,

100
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,050
we would recognize dividend income.

101
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,500
And if this were an available for sale security,

102
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,260
we'd also recognize dividend income.

103
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,360
But with equity method, the difference

104
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,180
is we're going to reduce our investment

105
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,560
by the amount of the dividend.

106
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,330
So cash goes up, and our investment goes down.

107
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,400
So we have a return on capital on our investment, so to speak.

108
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,220
On December 31, market price of Zoltan is $13 a share.

109
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,770
Under the equity method, there's no accounting here.

110
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,400
So if this were a trading security

111
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,770
or if this were available for sale,

112
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,890
we would increase our investment, our asset,

113
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,890
to reflect the fact that the price has gone up.

114
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,960
But under equity method we're essentially

115
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,560
using historical cost, so we do not change

116
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,750
the value of our investment.

117
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,100
Then, Zoltan reports its earnings as $20,000.

118
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,750
So let's remember we own 30% of this security.

119
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,090
So we're going to get a 30% share of our earnings.

120
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,180
So $6,000, that increases our investment,

121
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,290
and that's going to be income for us.

122
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,990
That's going to increase our retained earnings.

123
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,480
And we're calculating that as $20,000 worth of earnings

124
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,620
times our 30% share.

125
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,420
Recall that Zoltan has $5 a share in unrecorded patents.

126
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:29,440
And this $5 a share is part of Zsa Zsa's investment.

127
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,410
And then, we're going to amortize

128
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,420
the unrecorded patents.

129
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,110
So the patents are worth $5 a share.

130
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,530
We're going to amortize them over 10 years.

131
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,890
So $5 a share divided by 10 years is $0.50 a share.

132
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,890
And then we have 1,000 shares, so we're

133
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,980
going to amortize the cost of these patents.

134
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,140
They're going to reduce our investment

135
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:00,040
and they're going to reduce our retained earnings by $500.

136
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,390
Finally-- but before we get to that

137
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,170
finally, remember when we looked at Facebook earlier

138
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,890
in this class, we saw that Facebook

139
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,610
was including the amortization of intangibles.

140
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,140
If Facebook had not bought 100% of WhatsApp,

141
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,980
as we saw that they did--

142
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,690
but if they bought 30% of it at the same price,

143
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,850
the amortization would be 30% of this number.

144
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,210
So that's just a link back to acquisition accounting.

145
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,340
The final step is that Zsa Zsa is

146
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,230
going to sell 1,000 shares of Zoltan for $17 a share.

147
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:47,250
So 1,000 shares times $17 gives us cash of $17,000.

148
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,400
We are going to reduce our investment.

149
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,840
So we no longer own the Zoltan.

150
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,490
So we're going to pull out the 19,500 total investment we

151
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,680
have at Zoltan at this point.

152
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,700
And then we're going to take a $2,500 loss on that investment.

153
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,420
So that's a comprehensive example

154
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,530
of how to do the equity method.
