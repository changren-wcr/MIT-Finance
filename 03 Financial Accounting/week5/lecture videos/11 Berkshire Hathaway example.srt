PROFESSOR: Until recently, equity investments

1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,840
could be accounted for as available for sale

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,230
securities, which means that you wouldn't have these income

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,370
effects.

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,780
And that brings about this article,

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,660
where an investor's talking about I can't see Berkshire

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,700
Hathaway's bottom line.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,920
This new accounting rule, which meant that all equity

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,970
securities had to be accounted for as trading securities,

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,060
so the FASB decreed that stock gains and losses

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,320
must be reported as earnings.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,620
So equity securities must be accounted

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,380
for as trading securities.

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,830
So Berkshire Hathaway's pretax earnings

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:51,596
jumped from $5.3 billion to $23 billion.

15
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:54,140
Did its earnings quadruple?

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,540
No, we just had a different accounting standard.

17
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,310
And according to this writer-- and I

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,090
agree with this-- the meaningful portion of Berkshire's profits

19
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,210
are the profits of its businesses, not its securities

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,780
portfolio.

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,270
But now, investors have to dig around in income statements

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,610
to figure out what the comparable numbers are.
