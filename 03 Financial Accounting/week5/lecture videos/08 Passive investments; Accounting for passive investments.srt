PROFESSOR: Now I want to spend a minute now talking

1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,570
about this picture of all the types of financial investments

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,200
you can have.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,610
So on the left box, it shows ownership.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,800
And the question is, does the company own less than 50%,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
or does it own more than 50% on the bottom?

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,550
If you own less than 50%, do you own less than 24%

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,400
which is called a passive investment,

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,070
or do you own more than 20%, which

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,090
is called an investment with significant influence?

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,710
So the first thing we're going to talk about here

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,530
is passive investments that are accounted

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,350
for is either trading investments

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,140
or available for sale investments.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,500
Those investments are going to be fair-valued on our balance

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,430
sheet.

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,620
And then later on in this session,

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,200
we'll talk about the other types of investments,

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,620
which will not be fair-valued on our balance sheet.

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,180
So passive investments according to financial accounting

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:15,820
standard 115, now modified by accounting standard 2016-01,

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,390
requires a firm to classify its investments

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,620
into three categories.

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,220
And these are based on the intent of the firm that

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,240
inquired these investments.

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,460
Number one is held-to-maturity.

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,200
So if you buy a bond, and you intend

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,830
to hold that bond to maturity, and you have the ability

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,200
to hold that bond to maturity, you

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,430
can ask for accounting for it to be held-to-maturity accounting.

30
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,200
Trading securities, which can be either debt or equity,

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,410
are securities that you acquire for short-term profit

32
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,070
potential.

33
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,930
An available for sale, which is debt only,

34
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,950
is securities that are not classified

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,220
as either of the above.

36
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,900
And as a note, and we'll come back

37
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,419
to this, until recently equity could be also classified

38
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,810
as available for sale.

39
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:20,510
So the accounting for these is held-to-maturity,

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,180
has no balance sheet effect, and therefore

41
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,950
no income statement of fact.

42
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,900
So held-to-maturity, which is only for debt,

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,330
is attractive because fluctuations

44
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,870
in the market value's security don't show up

45
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,750
until you sell the security.

46
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,830
Available for sale, there is a balance sheet effect--

47
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,900
question one is yes--

48
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,210
but there's no income statement effect--

49
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,980
question two is no.

50
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,360
We'll see how this works in a second.

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,840
And then trading securities, which

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,570
can be both debt and equity, there's

53
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,650
both a balance sheet effect and an income statement effect.

54
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,540
So what this shows then if you look at this matrix

55
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,050
is that changes in market value affect the balance

56
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,750
sheet for both available for sale and for trading

57
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,170
securities, but only affect the income statement

58
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,830
for trading securities.

59
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,950
So this is kind of all, you need to know

60
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,940
about the accounting for this.

61
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,880
So this slide is a useful piece of information

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,790
to keep handy say like for an exam or something like that.
