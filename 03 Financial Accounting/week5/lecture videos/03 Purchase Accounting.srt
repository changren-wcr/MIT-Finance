00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
PROFESSOR: All right, so now, this segment,

1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,300
we're going to do the accounting for this acquisition.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,690
So here's DirecTV's balance sheet as of June 30, 2015.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,210
It comes out from their quarterly report or their 10-Q.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,640
And I chose this balance sheet because it's right

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,430
before the merger was finalized.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,290
I'm going to recast the balance sheet

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,030
to show assets for first minus liabilities equals

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,330
stockholders' equity.

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,940
So you see the balance sheet.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,830
We got three types of assets.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,250
We got tangible assets like property, plant, and equipment

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,750
and investments.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,250
We've got intangible assets like customer list.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,790
And we've got goodwill.

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,900
So those are the three assets that DirecTV

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,320
has before the merger.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,740
You got a total assets of about $25 billion,

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,550
total liabilities of about $29.

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,960
Billion and that's why their book value of net assets

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,371
is a negative $3 and 1/2 billion.

21
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:10,640
Notice that they have some intangible assets and goodwill.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,350
What does that tell us?

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,140
Looking forward to later in the class,

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,060
this tells us that DirecTV has itself done acquisitions.

25
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,970
And those acquisitions have resulted

26
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,970
in intangible assets and goodwill

27
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,200
on their balance sheet.

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,820
So now.

29
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,690
We're going to walk through the accounting for the acquisition.

30
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,010
So given the acquisition price, what's

31
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,440
the market value in that assets, not

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,810
the book value but the market value of the net assets?

33
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:51,980
So as we talk to Bob, AT&T is paying $47.8 billion for this.

34
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:57,140
So AT&T purchases saying the market value of net assets

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,000
is $47.8 billion.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,090
And this is purchase accounting, how

37
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,110
we account for the acquisition.

38
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,030
So under purchase accounting, the entire acquisition payment,

39
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,250
in this case, $47.8 billion is added to the acquirer's balance

40
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:16,970
sheet.

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,450
And it's going to be distributed across fair value

42
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,340
of tangible assets and liabilities.

43
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,560
So in the case of DirecTV, they got some satellites up

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,380
in the sky.

45
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,010
They've got other property, plant, and equipment on land.

46
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,990
They've got some financial assets.

47
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,880
They've got some other assets.

48
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,630
And they've got some liabilities.

49
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,660
So that's their tangible assets and liabilities.

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,600
And then we're going to identify intangible assets.

51
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,760
So in DirecTV's case, they've got some orbital slots,

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,850
so they have rights to put a satellite up

53
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,640
into the sky in a certain place.

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,710
That's an intangible asset.

55
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,530
They've got relationships with their customers.

56
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,680
They've got the DirecTV trade name.

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,830
And they may have some patents as well.

58
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,510
And then goodwill is an intangible asset

59
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,520
that we can't separately identify.

60
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,060
So we can say we've got these customer relationships.

61
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,790
And we know that we have customer relationships

62
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,200
because we've got the customer's name, email, and phone number.

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,780
But goodwill is more squishy.

64
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,080
So we can't separately identify it.

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,560
So that's going to be everything else in our valuation.

66
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,590
And it's going to be a plug meaning that we're just

67
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,960
going to solve for the amount of goodwill

68
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,800
after we value the tangible assets and liabilities

69
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,860
and after we've valued the identifiable intangible assets.

70
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,030
So working again through our example,

71
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,940
this is called allocating the purchase price.

72
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,740
The accounting records at the time

73
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,140
says our property, plant, and equipment

74
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,100
is worth $9.5 billion.

75
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,640
But remember, from our class on property, plant, and equipment,

76
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,900
accumulated depreciation can be either more or less

77
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,310
than economic depreciation.

78
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,910
So now when we do the acquisition, we got experts,

79
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,240
they say how much the satellites are worth.

80
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,060
They say how much the other property, plant, and equipment

81
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,020
is worth.

82
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,880
And this is our fair value of tangible assets.

83
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,600
So we've got a bunch of experts go in

84
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,120
and value the property, plant, and equipment.

85
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,090
And that gives us a fair value of tangible assets.

86
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,620
The customer list is not on DirecTV's balance sheet

87
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,280
nor is the value of DirecTV's orbital slots

88
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,940
nor is the value of its spectrum nor is the value of its trade

89
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,820
names.

90
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,450
So in the process of the acquisition,

91
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,070
we bring in experts.

92
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,140
We bring in marketing experts.

93
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,420
And they look at the customer list.

94
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,820
And they say this kind of customer list

95
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,000
is worth whatever, $1 a person.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,640
And they multiply the number of customers

97
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,610
times that valuation per person and come up

98
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,830
with the value of the customer list.

99
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,850
So that's the value of the identifiable intangibles.

100
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,470
And finally, there may be synergies.

101
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,170
OK so again, one plus one might equal three in this case.

102
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,670
But synergies are not something we can point to in particular.

103
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,160
And that's going to be goodwill.

104
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,940
Now, let's work back through our purchase price allocation.

105
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,960
So remember we figured out what the market value of net assets

106
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,030
and liabilities are.

107
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,440
The second step is we're going to value the tangible assets,

108
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,950
and we're going to value the liabilities from the materials

109
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,220
in the case, the value of the tangible assets

110
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,830
are worth slightly less than the book value.

111
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,560
And the value of the liabilities is worth about $14 billion more

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,670
than their book value.

113
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,900
Notice that once we value the liabilities,

114
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,020
we know what the market value of the net assets are.

115
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,380
So now we know the market value of the total assets.

116
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,300
Our second step is to value the intangible asset.

117
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,160
Remember that AT&T has hired valuation experts.

118
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,200
And those experts have determined

119
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,630
that the value of DirecTV's customer

120
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,930
list and other intangible assets is $36 billion.

121
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,320
And once we know the value of the tangible assets,

122
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,600
we can solve for or plug for goodwill.

123
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,790
So we've got one equation and one on none there, basically,

124
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,610
and we use the balance sheet equation to solve

125
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,260
for goodwill of $34 billion.
