PROFESSOR: So takeaways from acquisitions, we

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,450
talked about acquisitions.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,410
The alternative is to grow things internally.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,710
With acquisitions, when you buy intangible assets,

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,630
they come on balance sheet.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,110
When you grow those same intangible assets,

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,530
within the firm, they don't come onto your balance sheet,

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,240
because of the differences in how intangibles are treated.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,900
When they're purchased, rather than when they're

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,680
developed internally, both in the US and also under IFRS,

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,800
firms are required to use purchase accounting.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,270
And as we saw, assets will be written up to market value.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,850
And at that time, intangible assets

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,250
will be added to the balance sheet

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,010
and amortized or depreciated over time.

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,790
And then finally, we talked about goodwill,

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,150
how it comes about, and when it's impaired,

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,870
and the fact that the impairment decision is

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,469
fairly discretionary.
