1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,340
PROFESSOR: So here's Intel's 2013 annual report,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,860
their statement of stockholders equity.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,320
Notice, as we've seen before, we've got common stock,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,010
we've got retained earnings, but now we

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,860
have this new account, which is accumulated

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,480
other comprehensive income or other comprehensive loss.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,650
We see that begins with a negative balance of 399.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,530
Intel has some comprehensive income,

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,890
probably from their available-for-sale securities.

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,820
And their balance of accumulated other comprehensive income

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,240
is 1,243 as of 2013.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,420
Other disclosures Intel provides--

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,800
in their footnote 5, they talk about cash and investments

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,110
and, in particular, available-for-sale securities.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,100
They first show adjusted cost, which

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,890
is how much they pay for the securities

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,220
plus any transactions cost.

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,350
They show next unrealized gains, unrealized losses.

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,290
And then if you sum the columns across that

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,600
gives you the fair value.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,620
And these fair values are reported on their balance sheet

22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,540
as cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable equity

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,110
investments, and other long term investments.

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,200
And then what we're mainly concerned about here

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,180
is these gains and losses are going

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,920
to be recorded in other comprehensive income or equity.

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,500
In terms of the statement of cash flows,

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,300
passive investments are going to affect

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,230
the statement of cash flows.

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,040
So transactions and trading securities

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,120
can be reported either in cash flow from operations

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,210
or in cash flow from investments.

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,450
Transactions in available-for-sale securities

34
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,020
should be reported in cash flow from investments.

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,620
So that these changes in the fair value securities

36
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,680
are going to be, of course, removed from cash flow

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,340
from operation from net income when we compute

38
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,370
cash flow from operations.
