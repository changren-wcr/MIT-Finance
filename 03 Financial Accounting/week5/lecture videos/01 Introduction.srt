PROFESSOR: Now, we're going to do two things.

1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,440
We're going to talk about acquisitions.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,910
And we're going to look at a case

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,830
where AT&T corp, which is the telephone company,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,650
bought DirecTV, which is the cable or pay TV company.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,920
We'll also do financial investments.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,480
So again, this class is first acquisitions.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,300
We're going to look at the AT&T/DirecTV case.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,810
And acquisitions are a special case of financial investments.

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,580
And then, in the second part of the class,

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,940
we're going to do financial investments more broadly.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,230
So our objectives in acquisitions

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,930
are to understand some of the basics of mergers

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,030
and acquisitions, which is an interesting topic.

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,590
This is an accounting class, so we're

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,050
going to be focusing on how firms account

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,690
for mergers and acquisitions.

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,330
And as part of that, we're going to introduce goodwill

18
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,870
accounting and talk about the inherent difficulties

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,440
associated with accounting for goodwill.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,020
As motivation, here's a story or a picture from The Journal

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,750
back in February 2020.

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,690
And it just compiles the number of acquisitions

23
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,820
done by Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon,

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,550
so the big tech companies in the US.

25
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:33,050
So Google or Alphabet has done 180 acquisitions since 2010.

26
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,760
Many of these are small acquisitions.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,900
What we're going to look at today is a bigger acquisition.
