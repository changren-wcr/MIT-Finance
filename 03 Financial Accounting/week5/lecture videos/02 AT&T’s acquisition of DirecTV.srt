00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,910
PROFESSOR: So AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV--

1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,140
what is DirecTV?

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:12,560
So DirecTV is a satellite TV provider.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,940
So instead of getting cable from a company like Comcast,

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,530
you put a satellite dish on your house or on your apartment,

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,400
and the TV comes to you through that satellite dish

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,750
rather than through the cable.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,840
Second question is, why was AT&T,

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,240
which is the phone company, why was it interested in DirecTV?

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,450
So AT&T, at this time, was an internet provider.

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,940
So it could provide internet, but it could not provide TV.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,820
So the thought was if AT&T and DirecTV got together, AT&T

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,890
would have internet customers.

13
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,990
DirecTV it would have TV customers.

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,160
They could cross-sell each other's customers

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,020
and increase their mutual profits.

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,640
In addition, AT&T wanted to diversify.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,630
And they wanted to compete with people like Comcast that

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,950
already had both TV and internet.

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,340
So what was AT&T's alternative to purchasing DirecTV?

20
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,830
Well, [? it ?] could have just done nothing.

21
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,850
But if it wants TV, in theory, with work and expense,

22
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,920
it could have developed a TV capability internally.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,380
Or it could have bought Dish or somebody

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,160
like that, which was a different satellite TV company.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,840
Or it could have bought Comcast, which was a cable TV company.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,318
So it had alternatives, but it decided that it

27
00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:47,360
was going to buy DirecTV.

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,950


29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,770
Now, some facts on the acquisition.

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,580
How much did AT&T pay for DirecTV?

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,620
And how do they finance the acquisition?

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,980
So this is a big acquisition.

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,291
AT&T paid $47.8 billion.

34
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,060
It financed the acquisition.

35
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,300
70% of the payment was in stock.

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,140
And then 30% of the payment was in cash.

37
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,090
It paid a 38% premium to DirecTV's stock price

38
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,330
prior to the announcement of the acquisition.

39
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,600
In addition to this, as we'll see in a second,

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,440
when you buy a company, you get all the assets,

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,700
and you assume all the liabilities of the company.

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,420
Now, let's just think about DirecTV for a second.

43
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,270
Before the acquisition, as of June 30, 2015,

44
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,700
DirecTV had a Market Value of Equity,

45
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:56,370
which we abbreviate MVE, it had an MVE of $46.8 million.

46
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,170
Its net assets, which is assets minus liabilities,

47
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,040
or Book Value of Equity, BVE--

48
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,605
it's Book Value of Equity, BVE, was minus $3.4 billion.

49
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:15,660
Recall that by the balance sheet equation,

50
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,800
equity is net assets or assets minus liabilities.

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,990
So there's a $50 billion difference between market value

52
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,130
and book value.

53
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,850
And the question is, how does DirecTV

54
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:35,230
have such a large market value and such a low book value?

55
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,440
And the answer is, as we talked earlier,

56
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,620
is its intangible assets.

57
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,310
So DirecTV has valuable intangible assets.

58
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,170
The accounting system doesn't allow

59
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,430
you to put those on your balance sheet.

60
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,230
So those valuable intangible assets are off balance sheet.

61
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,330
They're part of the market value,

62
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,490
but they're not part of the book value.

63
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,340
And then in general, intangible assets

64
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,730
include things like intellectual property, so patents,

65
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,970
copyrights, and trademarks.

66
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,955
It includes licenses and franchise rights.

67
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:18,510
So DirecTV has licenses to operate satellites in space.

68
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,890
DirecTV may have a brand value.

69
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,470
So the value of the DirecTV brand is valuable.

70
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,740
DirecTV has customer lists that are valuable.

71
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,300
We will talk later about how DirecTV has goodwill.

72
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,040
So in this class, in contrast to our discussions

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,340
about intangible assets in general, in this class,

74
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,270
we'll see that an acquisition puts a market

75
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,300
value of these intangible assets and then puts

76
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,420
those intangible assets on our balance sheet.

77
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,840
Let's think for a minute about the acquisition price.

78
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,740
So how much did AT&T pay?

79
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,150
So as we talked about before, $47.8 billion.

80
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,820
How is AT&T financing the acquisition?

81
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,640
So partly in stock and partly in cash.

82
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,620
What was DirecTV's book value?

83
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,800
Again, it was minus $3.4 billion.

84
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,650
What is AT&T paying for when it pays that $47.8 billion

85
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,990
for a company that has negative book value of $3.4 billion?

86
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,490
Again, in part, it's these intangible assets,

87
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,240
intellectual property, licenses, brand value,

88
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,890
and customer lists.

89
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,930
And then we'll see in a couple of minutes,

90
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,620
it's also paying for goodwill.

91
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,720
And in this case, it's also paying for control.

92
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,760
It's going to become the sole shareholder of DirecTV.

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,790
And controlling an asset is valuable.

94
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:05,480
So there's some idea that if you buy control of an asset,

95
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,420
you're going to pay a premium for control because you

96
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,780
get to say what the asset does rather

97
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,930
than having individual shareholders control it.

98
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,240
So we pay 38% more than the prevailing stock price.

99
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,190
Why did AT&T pay more than the prevailing stock price?

100
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,410
Well, for one thing--

101
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,960
this is a funny word, synergies.

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,940
So when we bring AT&T and DirecTV together,

103
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,090
maybe 1 plus 1 equals 3.

104
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,820
So maybe the combination of the two of them

105
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,410
is worth more than the two separately.

106
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,770
The seller, in this case, DirecTV,

107
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,140
if there's synergies created, the seller's

108
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,570
able to capture some of those synergies.

109
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,420
So part of the premium goes to the seller,

110
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,510
which is DirecTV, for those synergies.

111
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,880
And then finally, as we just talked about,

112
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,610
AT&T is paying a premium for control of DirecTV.
