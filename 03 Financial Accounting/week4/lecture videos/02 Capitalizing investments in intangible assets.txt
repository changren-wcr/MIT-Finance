1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,190
PROFESSOR: We're going to now examine

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,570
intangible assets, particularly intangible assets held

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,040
by software companies.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,880
So as noted above, under GAAP, internally

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,730
developed intangible assets are expensed.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,140
The one exception is software development expenditures

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,020
and intangibles purchased from another company, which

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,480
we're going to talk about in a later class.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,480


10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,050
Now this is not on the exam, but just as background,

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,810
the US accounting system has some rules

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,120
for capitalizing software development costs.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,950
So instead of just expensing software development costs,

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,740
we're going to capitalize some of those costs

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,670
and put them on our balance sheet.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,310
So the rules are basically when you're doing research,

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,540
so like if you're developing an app

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,910
but you don't know whether the app is going to work or not,

19
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,960
you're going to expense the cost in the preliminary development

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,070
phase.

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,720
Once you've gotten the app to a point where it's likely

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,160
that you'll be able to complete it and sell it,

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,150
you're going to start capitalizing those development

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,320
costs.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,690
After those development costs are capitalized,

26
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,120
they're going to be expensed just

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,090
like depreciation on a building, but now we're

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,170
going to amortize them over the useful life of the software.

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,770
And then we're going to look at some companies, some health

30
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,600
care companies, that develop software for internal use,

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,860
and then again this is not on the exam,

32
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,970
but apparently the rules for software development

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,930
for internal use is a little looser in the sense

34
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,720
that you can put more of the costs on your balance sheet.

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,315
And here there's a lot of variation in practice.

36
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:55,160
So Mulford and Roberts in 2006 do a nice study

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,960
and they find that almost 3/4 of US software companies,

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,230
71% of US software companies, don't

39
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,630
capitalize any of their software development costs.

40
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,340
So in some sense what they're saying is that by the time

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,980
the software is ready to come to market,

42
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,380
they've already had all the costs associated with it.

43
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,770
So they're not going to capitalize any cost.

44
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,870
But remember there's about 30% of software companies that

45
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,860
do capitalize costs.

46
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:33,820
And then more broadly, IFRS encourages capitalization

47
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,600
of development costs in addition to software costs,

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,460
but Mazzi et al., 2019, find that over 60%

49
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,510
of non-US companies that do research and development

50
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,220
don't capitalize any costs.

51
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,630
So the bottom line here is there's a lot of discretion

52
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,140
and judgment involved in whether and how much costs

53
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,090
are capitalized.

54
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,890
And the intuition of it again is I'm making my app.

55
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,490
When do I stop doing research on the app

56
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,030
and when do I sort of have a working model of the app?

57
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,970
And I'm developing the app and I can start capitalizing costs.

58
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,710
And I think a lot of companies just

59
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,580
think that maybe we just want to expense everything,

60
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,200
as that way we don't have to keep

61
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,840
track of what to capitalize.

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,080
So it's cheaper to just expense everything maybe.

63
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,250
And then investors don't seem to mind if companies write off

64
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,640
or expense everything rather than capitalizing some things.
