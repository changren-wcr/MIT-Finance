1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,050
PROFESSOR: In the remainder of this class,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,690
we're going to have some fun and talk about some examples.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,110
So one piece of lingo used in the US markets is the word

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:25,170
FAANG, F-A-A-N-G, referring to tech stocks Facebook, Amazon,

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,220
Apple, Netflix, and Google.

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,460
And you see that chart there from the Motley Fool

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,580
that shows that all of these stocks

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,920
have outperformed the S&P 500 index in the last 10 years

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,210
or so.

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,570
And these stocks or these tech stocks

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,510
are thought to drive the market.

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,610
So you'll often hear reference to the FAANG

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,350
stocks are driving the market.

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,000
So I want to talk a little bit about Netflix as a comparison

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,980
to Amazon.

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,960
So this is an article from Barron's, also from 2018.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,620
And Barron's is an investment publication put out

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,020
by The Wall Street Journal.

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,900
And if you're interested in investing as a career,

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,400
I would encourage you to pick up Barron's, which is published

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,040
once every week on Saturday.

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,080
Read through that on Saturday morning.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,830
There's lots of interesting stories about investments here.

24
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,270
So this story's about Netflix's earnings,

25
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,670
and it's entitled "Where Accounting Meets Showbiz."

26
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,590
And it talks about Netflix earnings are a creation

27
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,690
of accounting practices.

28
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,670
So Netflix, as you know, is always

29
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,920
making these original shows.

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,260
The original shows are quite costly.

31
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,920
So if you make House of Cards or something like that--

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,860
I'm not up on the most recent Netflix.

33
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,100
But if you make House of Cards, that thing

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,350
might cost, like, $100 million.

35
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,440
So you're investing a lot of money

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,710
into creating this original show.

37
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,810
And when you're making these investments,

38
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,220
your operating cash flows are quite negative.

39
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,450
But because of differences in US accounting standards,

40
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,200
Netflix has earnings on its income statements

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,850
even though cash flow is very negative because the accounting

42
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,800
rules allow what the article writer calls show business

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,630
companies to capitalize their production expenses.

44
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:44,560
And this sort of leads into two somewhat confusing things

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,910
if you don't know this accounting.

46
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,060
So a biotech company, if it develops a drug,

47
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,870
all of its development costs are going to be expensed.

48
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,130
And you would think that Netflix developing an original show

49
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,110
as a risk level comparable to a drug company developing

50
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,670
a new drug.

51
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,540
But Netflix-- because of show business accounting

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,670
rules, Netflix gets to capitalize those costs.

53
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,810
So those costs go on balance sheet.

54
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,010
The second accounting difference is that, these development

55
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,860
costs for these original shows, they're

56
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,210
not considered to be an investing cash

57
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,830
flow like property, plant, and equipment.

58
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,450
But they're considered to be an operating cash flow.

59
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,700
So what this all means is, when you look at Netflix

60
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,470
and compare it to Amazon--

61
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,360
this is 2016 numbers.

62
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,930
And here I have scaled net income and operating cash flow

63
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,550
by sales.

64
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,980
The reason I did that is because-- you can see

65
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,200
by the sales numbers there--

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,100
Netflix is a much smaller company than Amazon.

67
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,750
So by expressing net income as a percentage of sales and cash

68
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,210
flow as a percentage of sales, we're

69
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:14,240
sort of able to look at these two companies on a more apples

70
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,080
to apples basis.

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,800


72
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,680
So Netflix's net income is 2% of sales,

73
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,010
whereas Amazon's net income is 1.7% of sales.

74
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,420
So if you just are focused on the income number,

75
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,780
you think that Netflix is a much more profitable company

76
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,310
than Amazon.

77
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,100
But if you look at operating cash flow,

78
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,130
Netflix's operating cash flow is a minus 17%, basically,

79
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,870
whereas-- we talked about earlier--

80
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:52,580
Amazon has huge operating cash flow equal to 12% of sales.

81
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,260
So it shows you that it's worthwhile

82
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,140
looking at both income and operating cash flow.
