1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,330
PROFESSOR: So to understand the cash flow statement,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,730
we're going to look at an interesting company, which

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,660
is Amazon.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,720
So you've got the case materials in front of you.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,530
And we're going to talk about Amazon's cash flow

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,170
statement and Amazon's performance, in general.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,620
So thinking about Amazon's performance,

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,870
from 2014 to 2016, which is what's in the case materials,

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,440
we see big increases in net income.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,230
We see big increases in cash.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,110
And we see big increases in the stock price.

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,650
For the last 20 years or so, Amazon

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,330
hasn't been that profitable.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,040
But we also see big increases in cash for the last 20 years

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,770
for Amazon and big increases in the stock price for Amazon.

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,700
And you can see this from the case in this picture

17
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,870
here where the orange line, which

18
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,670
is a flat line that goes across, is Amazon's net income.

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,690
It says that Amazon, in the last 10 years or so,

20
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,190
hasn't been all that profitable.

21
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,220
But if you look at the red line, you

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,780
see that cash flow has really accelerated.

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,070
So Amazon is doing something to generate

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,260
lots and lots of cash flow.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,340
And when it generates that high amounts of cash flow,

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,850
it's generating large increases in the stock price,

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,370
as you can see from the blue line there.

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,910
And then, just putting some numbers to the case

29
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,920
so that we can talk about some numbers together--

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,030
so we'll look at a bunch of performance measures

31
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,190
here in the first column.

32
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:52,240
We're going to look at them in 2016, 2015, and 2014.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,440
So you can see that sales in 2014 was about $90 million.

34
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,830
And sales has increased substantially

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,280
in the years up to 2016.

36
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,610
Net income has also increased substantially,

37
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,300
operating cash flow, or cash flow from operations,

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,570
and then you use the acronym CFO,

39
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,910
for Cash Flow from Operations.

40
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:23,110
We see that cash flow from operations from 2014 to 2016,

41
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,760
has almost-- has more than doubled.

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,610
And then we'll talk about, later,

43
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,520
what this investing cash flow means

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,270
and what this financing cash law means.

45
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,800
So let's look more formally at Amazon's cash flow statement.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,820
So there are three sections to a cash flow statement.

47
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,420
At the top of the statement is operating cash flow

48
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,850
or cash flow from operations.

49
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,980
This is the cash that's generated

50
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,460
from our primary business activities.

51
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,050
Amazon sells goods over the internet.

52
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,820
Amazon has a web service as well.

53
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,390
So a lot of its cash flow from operations

54
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,350
comes from selling goods and rendering services.

55
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,450
Also, we record interest income and dividends

56
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,820
received in the statement in the operating section.

57
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,980
So if Amazon owns bonds and gets interest income

58
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,090
from those bonds, that will show up in the operating section.

59
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,770
If Amazon receives dividends because it owns stock,

60
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,160
that will also show up in the operating section.

61
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,680
Our second section, in the middle of the cash flow

62
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,390
statement, is the investing section.

63
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,220
So operating says, how do we do in our operations?

64
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,050
How much cash flow did we generate in our operations?

65
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,670
Investing is, what do we do with that cash flow?

66
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,540
Did we buy Property, Plant, and Equipment, PP&E?

67
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,530
Did we sell property, plant, and equipment?

68
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,930
Or did we buy securities in other firms?

69
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,060
Did we make investments in other firms' stock or debt?

70
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,460
So that's going to be in our investing section.

71
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,190
And then, finally, financing--

72
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,910
if we don't generate enough money from operating,

73
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,420
and we are spending lots of money on investing,

74
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,410
we have to come up with cash flow to finance the firms.

75
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,260
And the financing section of the cash flow statement

76
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,620
tells us where our financing is coming from.

77
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,370
So did we issue stock?

78
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,470
Did we issue debt?

79
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,880
Did we pay dividends?

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,820
That would be a financing use of cash flow.

81
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,470
Did we repurchase stock?

82
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,020
That would be a financing cash flow.

83
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,990
Did we repay or repurchase debt?

84
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,110
That also would've financing cash flow.

85
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,130
And the final point of the statement of cash flow

86
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,160
is operating, investing, and financing.

87
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,370
Those three activities are going to sum

88
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,730
to the actual change in cash and cash equivalents

89
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,600
during the year.

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,850
You can see that from the Amazon case.
