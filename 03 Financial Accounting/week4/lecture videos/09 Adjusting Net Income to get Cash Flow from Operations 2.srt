00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,417
PROFESSOR: Now we're going to talk

1
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:05,860
about a similar thing, which is stock-based compensation.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,630
So Amazon, recall, gives its employees $3 billion

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,380
of stock, at least in the last year.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,640
When Amazon gives its employees stock,

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,460
it gives them something that's not cash.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,490
So it's an expense that reduces net income.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,030
But it does not reduce cash flow from operations.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,870
We're just going to work through a couple of examples

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,670
using the balance sheet equation here.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,960
So as a review, if we pay an employee $1,000 in cash,

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,870
then cash is going to go down by $1,000.

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,290
So we reduce cash by $1,000.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,980
And then we've got a wage expense of $1,000.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,190
Now, what happens, as review again,

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,950
if we sell $1,000 worth of stock?

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,880
So if we sell $1,000 worth of stock,

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,970
contributed capital is going to go up by $1,000.

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,129
So that's the right-hand entry.

19
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,130
And we're going to get cash of $1,000.

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,370
And then finally, if we pay an employee $1,000 worth of stock,

21
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,830
well, we know there's going to be a wage expense.

22
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,450
So retained earnings is going to go down.

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,920
But what's the entry that's going to balance the balance

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,910
sheet equation?

25
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,240
So when we issue stock, we increase contributed capital.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,650
So when we pay an employee in stock, wage expense of $1,000

27
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,790
is going to be offset by contributed capital of $1,000.

28
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,060
So the point of this is the third transaction.

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,940
When we pay somebody in stock, even

30
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,760
though we have a wage expense that reduces net income,

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,360
there's no cash effect so that nothing happens

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,730
to cash flow from operations.

33
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,180
So now we've talked about an example

34
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,840
of why depreciation expense is something

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,060
that we add back to net income.

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,930
We talked about an example of why stock compensation

37
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,360
expense is something we add back to net income.

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,780
We're going to now talk about Amazon's

39
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,480
third major adjustment, which is making adjustments for changes

40
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,190
in working capital.

41
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,910
And working capital is a term that's used a lot.

42
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,340
And I just want to define it, basically,

43
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,430
as working capital is the difference

44
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,680
between current assets and current liabilities.

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
So assets that are going to pay off

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,370
in the next year minus liabilities

47
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,650
that we have to pay in the next year--

48
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,710
that's called working capital because we have it

49
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,680
to work with in the next year.

50
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Most people, when they're talking about working capital,

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,600
are actually talking about non-cash working capital, which

52
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,690
means current assets other than cash.

53
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,080
So we take current assets and subtract off cash

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,840
and then subtract off current liabilities.

55
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,570
And then we've talked a lot in the course

56
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,210
today about working capital accounts--

57
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,540
in particular, non-cash working capital accounts.

58
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,700
Accounts receivable is a current asset.

59
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,100
So instead of somebody paying us cash, they paid us credit.

60
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,780
Inventory is a current asset, prepaid assets.

61
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,120
Accounts payable is a current liability.

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,110
So instead of paying our suppliers in cash,

63
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,790
we pay them with paper, which is an accounts payable.

64
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,890
And then unearned revenues--

65
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,300
so we've got money.

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,520
But we haven't delivered the services.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,940
So now we're going to talk about why changes in working capital

68
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,190
affect cash flow from operations.

69
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,510
And we're going to just do this in a sequence of examples.

70
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:06,100
So suppose that we buy $1,000 worth of inventory for cash,

71
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,900
we being Amazon, and we want to use the balance sheet

72
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,180
equation to account for this transaction.

73
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,459
So if we buy inventory for cash, cash

74
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,040
is going to go down by $1,000.

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,650
Inventory is going to go up by $1,000.

76
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,780
Does this affect cash?

77
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,370
Well, we see that cash went down.

78
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,070
So clearly, yes.

79
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,560
Does it affect net income?

80
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,880
We don't see any accounting for net income.

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,000
So clearly, no.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,470
So because of the fact that this reduced cash,

83
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,080
but it did not reduce net income,

84
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,290
we need to subtract the $1,000 from net income

85
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,230
to get cash flow from operations.

86
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,060
So this was an example using a current asset.

87
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,070
Now we're going to do an example using a current liability.

88
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,960
So let's look at deferred revenue.

89
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,080
So suppose Amazon sells a gift card or sells services

90
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,050
and it gets $1,000 before it does

91
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,210
any providing of the services.

92
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,600
So let's use the balance sheet equation to account

93
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,770
for this transaction.

94
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,760
So as a review, we know that cash

95
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,980
is going to go up by $1,000.

96
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,900
And we know that unearned revenue

97
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,940
is going to go up by $1,000.

98
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,820
And this is not regular revenue.

99
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,340
It's unearned revenue because of the fact

100
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,650
that we haven't provided the service yet.

101
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,240
So does this transaction affect cash?

102
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,170
Clearly, yes.

103
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,760
We see that cash goes up.

104
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,040
Does it affect net income?

105
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,720
Again, we don't see an accounting for net income.

106
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,780
So there's no accounting for net income.

107
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,220
So because of the fact that we got this income

108
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,890
in cash ahead of time, we need to add $1,000 in net income

109
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,960
to get to cash flow from operations.

110
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,020
So those are two examples of why changes in working capital

111
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,780
accounts are going to be an adjustment

112
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,570
to cash flow from operations.

113
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,460
So our recipe to get to cash flow

114
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,240
from operations from net income, and you can see this, again,

115
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,850
illustrated in Amazon's cash flow from operations,

116
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,000
is-- remember that cash flow from operations

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,050
is equal to the net income minus accruals.

118
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,840
So we're going to start with net income.

119
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,210
And then we're going to add and subtract accruals

120
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,370
to get to cash flow from operations.

121
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,170
So we're going to start with net income.

122
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,880
So the top of our operating cash flow statement

123
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,880
is always going to be net income.

124
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,610
Then we're going to add non-cash expenses.

125
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,480
So these are expenses that lower net income,

126
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,520
but don't require cash.

127
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,400
We just worked through two examples of that.

128
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
Depreciation expense reduces net income,

129
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,720
but doesn't have any cash effect.

130
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,670
Similarly, stock compensation reduces net income,

131
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,020
but has no cash effect.

132
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,920


133
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,870
And then we didn't see any examples

134
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,750
of this in Amazon's case.

135
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,630
But remember when we were talking about property, plant,

136
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,510
and equipment in an earlier class, when

137
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,970
we sell property, plant, and equipment,

138
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,340
we may have a gain on sale.

139
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,710
That's going to be part of net income.

140
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,820
But that's an investing activity.

141
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,540
So we want to subtract that gain on sale

142
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,860
or subtract any loss on sales from property, plant,

143
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,600
and equipment sales.

144
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,090
So that's our second adjustment.

145
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,030
And then our third and final adjustment

146
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,700
is adding and subtracting changes

147
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,520
in non-cash working capital accounts.

148
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
And that'll give us cash flow from operations,

149
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,880
as we saw from Amazon's cash flow statement earlier.

150
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,380
So this chart is basically a summary

151
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,810
where we put things in buckets, showing Amazon's cash

152
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,140
flow from operations.

153
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:22,546
So in 2016, Amazon had net income of $2.3 billion.

154
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:26,611
It had depreciation of about $8 billion,

155
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:30,961
stock compensation of about $3 billion,

156
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:34,750
other adjustments of about a billion dollars,

157
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,190
and the $4 billion change in working capital.

158
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,090
And that gave operating cash flow.

159
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,050
So what you probably want to do at home now

160
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,020
is just look at Amazon's statement

161
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,660
and see how we've done these groupings here,

162
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,670
see how we've taken Amazon's net income to its cash flow

163
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,030
from operations.
