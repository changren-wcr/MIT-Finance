1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,120
PROFESSOR: Now we're going to talk about comparability.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,800
And just as a reminder of what we

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,860
were doing earlier with depreciation,

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,370
let's suppose a company buys a computer server,

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,580
and it pays $100,000 for that server.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,379
To keep things simple, let's assume

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,210
there's no residual value.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,810
If the useful life is five years,

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,740
how much will depreciation expense be per year?

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,360
Well, $100,000 divided by 5 years is $20,000 a year.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,050
Now let's assume the use life is two years, how much

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,670
depreciation expense per year?

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,320
So that's the same $100,000 investment,

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,330
now we're depreciating that over two years.

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,320
So depreciation expense is $50,000 a year.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,120
Now with intangibles, it's exactly the same concept.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,390
So we're going to capitalize $100,000 worth of the software

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,740
costs.

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,920
Again, we're assuming no residual value,

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,360
but with intangibles the word is amortization, not depreciation,

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,990
but it's the same concept.

22
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,850
So if we have $100,000 of costs, useful life

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,570
is five years, than 100,000 divided by 5 years is $20,000.

24
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,530
So we're going to amortize $20,000 of these software costs

25
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,800
a year.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,130
Similarly, if the useful life is two years,

27
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:36,440
we're going to amortize 50,000 of these costs over two years.
