00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,220
PROFESSOR: So wrapping up this class, which I

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,860
hope you have found enjoyable.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,350
We talked about the statement of cash flow.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,870
And the statement of cash flow tells us

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,310
where our cash comes from.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,570
Does it come from operations?

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,540
Does it come from investing?

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,370
Does it come from financing?

9
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,930
And it's a useful statement.

10
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,260
Most people tend to look at the income statement only,

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,860
but it's a useful statement in telling us where the company's

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,570
growth comes from.

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,620
Is it financially healthy or not?

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,350
It's a way to evaluate financial company performance.

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,850
So if you take two companies, if they have the same amounts

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,940
of net income, you feel more confident in the company,

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,530
like Amazon, that's also generating lots of cash flow

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,480
from operations.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,240
You need cash flow from operations.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,180
You can't be like Netflix, where you continually

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,100
have negative cash flow from operations.

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,470
We can't pay bills with net income.

23
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,650
You can't pay bills without cash flow from operations.

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,900
It's important to be liquid.

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,600
So liquidity matters, and we need cash flow from operations.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,370
Though my bottom line is black, I am flat on my back.

27
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,800
My cash flows out.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,040
My customers pay slow.

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,460
A growth of my receivables, is almost unbelievable.

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,420
The result is certain, unremitting low.

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,550
And I hear the banker utter an ominous low mutter,

32
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,000
watch cash flow.
