00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:01,920
PROFESSOR: And then just switching gears

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,940
a little bit to Tesla, which has historically

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,520
been a company with very negative free cash flow

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,080
as well, its earnings announcement the journal

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,370
says, "thanks largely to stretched accounts payable,

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:25,145
Tesla even generated record free cash flow of about $1 billion?"

7
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:30,330
What does stretched accounts payable mean?

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,410
So this just means that in this quarter

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,690
Tesla did not pay off its suppliers.

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,500
So its accounts payable became larger.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,770
And as we talked about earlier, if you don't pay off

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,900
your suppliers that's a source of cash flow

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,200
so that it has the effect of increasing cash

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,090
flow from operations.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,970
Why does this increase free cash flow?

16
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,320
Well, again, from our definition of free cash flow, which

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,250
is cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures,

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,240
anything that increases cash flow from operations

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,170
is going to increase free cash flow.
