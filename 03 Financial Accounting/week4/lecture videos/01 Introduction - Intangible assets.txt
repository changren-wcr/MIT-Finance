1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,060
INSTRUCTOR: So the second part of our class today,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,490
we talked about depreciation and property, plant, and equipment.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,760
Now we're going to talk about intangible assets

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,300
and amortization.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,610
Remember, we just did the Hertz case.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,260
Hertz has cars.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,850
Cars are things you can touch.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,860
So you can touch a car.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,000
So tangible assets are things you can touch, inventory

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,020
in property, plant, and equipment.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,910
Tangible assets have physical substance.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,480
Intangible assets are things you can't touch,

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,670
such as patents, or brand value, or the value of your customers.

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,700
Intangible assets do not have physical substance.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,860
So when you think about it, if we make an investment in R&D--

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,590
so we're developing some software,

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,810
as we develop that software and build that software out,

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,360
it's sort of similar conceptually

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,530
to investing in a building and building that building out.

20
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,440
However, the accounting is completely different.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,550
So internally developed intangible assets

22
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,440
are expensed as opposed to property, plant, and equipment,

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,930
where you capitalize the value of property, plant,

24
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,420
and equipment and put it on the balance sheet as an asset.

25
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,400
The logic of this is what we talked

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,910
about in the very beginning of the course is,

27
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,690
for intangible assets, the future economic benefit

28
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,810
is thought not to be reliably measurable.

29
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,650
Whereas if we buy a car or if we buy a building,

30
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,520
the future economic benefits of those cars and buildings

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,850
are thought to be more reliably measurable.

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:54,270
So exceptions here-- and then we're going to talk about this

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,370
in the remainder of the class--

34
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,270
is certain software development expenditures.

35
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,230
And then in a later class when we talk about acquisitions,

36
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,560
we'll talk about how when you buy intangibles

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,650
from another company, those intangibles

38
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,420
will go on your balance sheet.

39
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,520
So as an example of the magnitude of intangible assets,

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,940
we're going to compute the value of Microsoft's

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,750
off-balance sheet assets as of their most recent fiscal year

42
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,150
end, as of June 30, 2019.

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,260
Now Microsoft is one of the biggest companies in the world,

44
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,000
so all these numbers are in billions.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,750
So their balance sheet shows that their total liabilities

46
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,320
have a book value of $184 billion.

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,140
Their book value of stockholders' equity

48
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,820
is $103 billion.

49
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,910
And their total assets, which are

50
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,420
equal to total liabilities and stockholders' equity

51
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,600
are $287 billion.

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,640
So now let's figure out what the market value of these assets

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,060
and liabilities are.

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,480
So the one we can look up in the newspaper

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,580
is the market value of stockholder's equity.

56
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,060
So as of 6/30/2019, Microsoft had about $8 billion shares

57
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,740
outstanding, and its price was about $135.

58
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,590
If you multiply those two numbers together,

59
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,830
the market value of Microsoft stockholders' equity

60
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,670
was $1.037 trillion.

61
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,950
So we can estimate the market value

62
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,470
of Microsoft stockholders' equity.

63
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,350
Now let's estimate the market value

64
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,440
of Microsoft's total liabilities.

65
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,510
We'll see in a later class the total liabilities have

66
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,270
a market value often of approximately

67
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,650
the same as the book value.

68
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,810
So we're just going to estimate the market value of Microsoft's

69
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:06,090
liabilities are equal to their book value of $184 billion.

70
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,480
And then we'll add down, and notice

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,320
that Microsoft's total assets are worth $1.2 trillion,

72
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,350
but their book value is only $0.3 trillion.

73
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,840
So Microsoft is missing from its accounting statements

74
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,720
$934 billion worth of market value.

75
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,610
So again just summarizing, as of June 2019,

76
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:45,326
Microsoft had a market value of equity of $1 trillion,

77
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:49,310
while their book value of equity was only $100 billion.

78
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,110
So how is it that $934 billion worth of market value

79
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,210
is missing from their total assets

80
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,070
and from their book value?

81
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,790
Well, a large part of this is that they

82
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,120
have a lot of valuable intangible assets

83
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,460
that, by the rules of GAAP, do not

84
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,530
appear on their balance sheet.

85
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,780
These intangible assets include all

86
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,750
of Microsoft's intellectual property--

87
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,300
so their patents, their copyrights,

88
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,890
and their trademarks.

89
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,630
They may have licenses.

90
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,240
They may have franchise rights.

91
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,850
The Microsoft brand is worth something.

92
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,540
So we're missing the brand value off the balance sheet.

93
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,390
All the customers that they have-- they

94
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,220
have lists of all their customers.

95
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,200
That's valuable as well.

96
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,870
And goodwill, as we'll talk about later,

97
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,100
is also missing from their balance sheet.
