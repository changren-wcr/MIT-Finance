1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,450
[Professor:_] Back to Amazon for a second,

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:09,210
we can see from its cash flow statement what it's doing with

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,130
its cash flow from operations.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:19,790
So in 2016 at the start of the year, Amazon had $16 billion

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,940
worth of cash on its balance sheet.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:31,300
It generated another $16 billion in operating cash flow.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,120
It used that operating cash flow. $10 billion

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,990
of that operating cash flow was used

9
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,720
to make investments to buy property, plant,

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,850
and equipment mainly.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,480
And another $3 billion of that operating cash flow

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,050
was used to repay financing.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,410
So we had a negative financing cash flow.

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,130
And that gives us ending cash of 19.--

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,360
$19 billion.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,940
So in terms of investing, as we saw before,

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,970
Amazon is buying lots of property, plant, and equipment.

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,850
So it bought $7 billion of property, plant, and equipment

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,590
in 2014.

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,990
And if you look at the cash flow statement in the case,

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,640
you can see that Amazon is also buying some stock

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,130
and debt in other companies.

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,750
In terms of financing, even though Amazon

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,260
generates lots and lots of cash, it doesn't pay a dividend.

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,710
It does not repurchase stock.

26
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,260
It had made some repayments on debt.

27
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,180
And then puzzlingly, when they have lots and lots of cash,

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,370
they raised $6 billion in debt in 2014.

29
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,460
And maybe that was because they saw

30
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,680
themselves buying Whole Foods.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:02,580
And the Whole Foods acquisition in 2017 was a $19 billion

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,730
acquisition.
