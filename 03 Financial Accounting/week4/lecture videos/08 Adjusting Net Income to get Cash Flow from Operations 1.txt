00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,300
PROFESSOR: To set this up, remember our discussion

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,080
about Zsa Zsa Company in our earlier class discussion

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,060
on depreciation expense.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:16,390
When Zsa Zsa buys a $20,000 car, cash decreases and property,

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,940
plant, and equipment increases.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,090
Recall that we set up the accumulated depreciation

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,400
contra-asset account to record depreciation.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,840
Then, every year following the purchase of the car,

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,510
we're going to increase depreciation expense

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,707
and retained earnings, which reduces net income.

11
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:40,540
And we're going to balance the balance sheet

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,860
equation by increasing the accumulated depreciation

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,140
contra-asset.

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,060
But the key point is, after we buy the car for cash,

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,490
depreciation expense has no effect on cash.

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,670
Now let's look at Amazon's depreciation in 2016.

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,770
So how much did Amazon pay for property, plant, and equipment,

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,830
or PP&E, in 2016?

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,930
We're going to use the BSE to account for this transaction.

20
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,070
So we're going to acquire some assets.

21
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,140
If we look at the cash flow statement in the investing

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,800
section, we'll see that we invested $6.7 billion

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,450
in new property, plant, and equipment.

24
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,670
And that's a reduction in cash.

25
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,700
So that's the balance sheet equation entry--

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,980
similar to the one we just did for Delta.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,710
Now, let's just make some assumptions here.

28
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,320
Let's make the assumption that, when

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,800
we buy this new property, plant, and equipment,

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,720
it has a five year useful life and it has no salvage value.

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,210
As intuition for this, remember that Amazon has web services

32
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,120
and that web services is growing a lot.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,730
They're buying lots of servers.

34
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,720
You might imagine a server, which is a fancy computer,

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,710
is a short-lived asset.

36
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,740
So that server is not going to last very long.

37
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,450
So maybe it lasts five years and maybe that server

38
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,970
has no salvage value.

39
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,600
So if we compute depreciation for these new servers, say,

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,820
we're adding $6.7 billion of assets.

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,750
They have no salvage value.

42
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,910
So we're dividing $6.7 billion divided by 5.

43
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,980
And that's going to give us a depreciation

44
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,130
expense of $1.3 billion a year.

45
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,810
And this is all review, but this just sort of shows you

46
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,260
why increases in property, plant, and equipment

47
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,305
are going to lead to increases in depreciation expense.

48
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:57,350


49
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,810
And if you just look in Amazon's investing activity--

50
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,310
so this is, again, their cash flow statement from the case.

51
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,950
So I've just highlighted, here, Amazon, the last three years,

52
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,440
has bought $6.7 billion worth of equipment in 2016,

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,100
$4.6 billion equipment in the prior year,

54
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,440
and about $5 billion of equipment in 2014.

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,310
And so when we think, why is Amazon's depreciation expense

56
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,980
going up over time, Amazon is growing their property, plant,

57
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,670
and equipment.

58
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,820
And if you have more property, plant, and equipment,

59
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,850
at a gross level, that means more depreciation.

60
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,490
If you look at the balance sheet,

61
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,950
you can see that our property, plant, and equipment--

62
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,400
or Amazon's property, plant, and equipment net

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,420
grew by about $8 billion in 2016.

64
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,200
And then, as we just saw in the investing section,

65
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,530
over the last three years, Amazon

66
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,580
has purchased over $16 billion worth of property, plant,

67
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,780
and equipment.

68
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,520
And that's the sum of the $6.7 billion in 2016,

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:18,890
the $4.6 billion in 2015, and the $4.9 billion in 2014.

70
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,170
And it hasn't been selling any material

71
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,450
amounts of fixed assets.

72
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,420
If Amazon was selling fixed assets,

73
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,660
we would see those sales also on the investing section

74
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,980
of the property, plant, and equipment.

75
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,700
So again, in terms of why depreciation's going up

76
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,850
over time, more property, plant, and equipment

77
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,310
means more depreciation.

78
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,510
Why is Amazon growing its property, plant, and equipment?

79
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,490
Well, for one thing, as we've seen before,

80
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,840
its sales have grown at a very fast rate-- so 24%

81
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,330
annualized in the past three years ending 2016.

82
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,670
If you're selling more stuff, that

83
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,910
means you need more distribution centers.

84
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,770
You need more trucks and stuff like that.

85
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,180
So you have to buy more property, plant, and equipment

86
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,040
to support your sales.

87
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,340
Also, Amazon hasn't just grown fast in the past.

88
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,240
It expects to grow fast in the future.

89
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,070
And if we want to grow fast in the future,

90
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,270
we need to invest in property, plant, and equipment, or fixed

91
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,580
assets, to support this growth.

92
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,940
So there's an interesting article from The Wall Street

93
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,000
Journal from 2018 titled "Big Tech to Get Its Head Out

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,800
of Cloud Frenzy."

95
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,950
And it talks about these hyperscale networks

96
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,570
owned by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook.

97
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,470
And what they're talking about are the cloud servers

98
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,950
or the web services, as Amazon calls it.

99
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,450
So these networks, the article says,

100
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,660
demand a staggering amount of capital expenditures.

101
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,180
So if you're going to serve companies and put

102
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,120
their data on your servers, you have

103
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,850
to buy lots and lots of servers.

104
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,900
And what's really fascinating here

105
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,760
is that these four companies spent $35 billion

106
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,520
in the first six months of 2018.

107
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,520
And that number's up 60% from the same period last year.

108
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,240
So even though these web businesses

109
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,670
sound like they're really profitable,

110
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,750
they also require lots of financing cash

111
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,000
flow and investing cash flow.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
So you have to invest quite a bit

113
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,710
to build these web services.

114
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,860
So that concludes our discussion on depreciation.

115
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,600
It gives us some idea of why Amazon is increasing

116
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,590
the amount of depreciation expense

117
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,900
it has each year, partly because of its web services,

118
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,090
and it tells us that that depreciation

119
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,350
is a non-cash charge that reduces net income

120
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,450
but doesn't affect cash flow from operations.
