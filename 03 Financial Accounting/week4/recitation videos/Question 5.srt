00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,070
PROFESSOR: Our third question asks

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,000
us to calculate CFO using the indirect method.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Note that the numbers written under the balance sheet

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,900
are the changes in each account or items in the balance sheet.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,830
So for example, this firm increased cash by $1,180

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,830
and increased interest payables by 200 and so forth.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,640
In this slide, these are the income statement, revenues,

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,270
cost, interest expenses, all the specific items

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,920
inside the income statement, and also the changes in the balance

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,390
sheet of the firm.

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,490
Its revenues are $5,000.

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,110
Cost is 600.

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,060
Interest expense is 320.

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,280
Depreciation expense 500.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,280
And gain on sale of a fixed asset is $800.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,590
So the net income is $4,380.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,750
If you look at the right hand side,

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,370
the part called the balance sheet,

19
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,560
as I've mentioned briefly before,

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,610
this denotes the changes in each account over the fiscal year.

21
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,710
For example, accounts receivables

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,720
increase by 4,500 and so on.

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,330
So the total assets increase by $6,080.

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,430
And our objective in this question

25
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,280
is to obtain cash flow from operations

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,710
using the indirect method.

27
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,550
Recall that we begin with net income in the indirect benefit.

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,820
So the net income is $4,380.

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,670
Next then we'll look at the depreciation expense

30
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,490
or any non-cash expense.

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,400
And our depreciation expense is 500.

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,890
This is not cash so therefore we add 500 to the net income.

33
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,770
We then subtract the gain on sale.

34
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,980
We do this because gain on sale is under cash flows

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,910
from investing.

36
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,450
So not subtracting this would be double counting.

37
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,390
Next we look at the changes in current assets and changes

38
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,750
in current liabilities.

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,880
We first subtract changes in current assets

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,320
from net income except for changes in cash.

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,500
Accounts receivables increase by 4,500,

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,430
inventory increased by 400, and interest payable

43
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,710
increased by 200, which is change in current liabilities.

44
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,650
So to reiterate, starting from net income 4,380,

45
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,450
I added non-cash expense of 500 and also subtracted

46
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,870
investing gain or loss by 800.

47
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,740
I also subtracted changes in current assets

48
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,196
since current assets increased by 4,500

49
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:43,140
for accounts receivable and for 400 for inventory.

50
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,260
I also added increase in payables.

51
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,990
So taking all those factors into account,

52
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,320
you can see that the total cash flow from operations

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,740
decreased by 620.
