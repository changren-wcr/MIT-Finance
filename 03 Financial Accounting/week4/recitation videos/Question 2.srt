PROFESSOR: Second question on intangibles--

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,950
ABC Corp has the following intangibles information

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,180
during and at the end of fiscal year 2019.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,030
How much R&D expense did ABC Corp

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,330
incur during fiscal year 2019?

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,510
Internally developed software costs are typically

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,860
expensed as I described before.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,110
And ABC has spent $83 million in developing and software.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,640
ABC Corp incurred $83 million in R&D expenses.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,220
How much intangibles amortization expense

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,790
that ABC incur during 2019?

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,310
Capitalized software costs in 2018 was $170 million,

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,790
with a useful life of 10 years.

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,240
Therefore, in 2019, dividing one million

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,810
by 10 years of useful life gives us $17 million

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,890
of amortization expense.
