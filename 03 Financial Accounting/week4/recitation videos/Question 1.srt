PROFESSOR: Let's dive right into the questions.

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,650
Question 1-- software development costs amortization.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,060
Suppose a firm's software costs capitalized for years 2015

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,410
to 2017 are as follows.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,750
If the useful life is two years, how much

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,880
is the amortization in 2017?

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,510
We first capitalize 2015 software costs for 2016 and 17.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,120
Since the useful life is two years,

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,560
and 2015's capitalized software costs is $100,

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,180
we record $50, which is $100 divided by 2, for years

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,200
both 2016 and 2017.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,780
For year 2017, we need to amortize 2016

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,980
to capitalize costs as well.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:56,950
2016 capitalized costs will be amortized over 2017 and 18.

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:04,599
In 2017, we record an additional $55 in 2017

16
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,470
to account for 2016's capitalized software costs,

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,890
which is $110 divided by 2.

18
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,820
Therefore, the total amortized cost in 2016 is $50,

19
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:24,010
and end cost in 2017 is $105, which is the sum of $50 and $5.
