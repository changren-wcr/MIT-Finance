00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
PROFESSOR: So back to our flowchart

1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,930
of shareholders' equity--

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,340
the bottom left column there, we just talked about common stock

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,910
and how common stock is divided into par value

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,430
and an additional paid-in capital.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,020
In this segment, we're going to talk about treasury stock.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,130
And treasury stock has been in the press a lot lately.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,290
So treasury stock is stock that's

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,670
been repurchased by the company.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,720
So instead of keeping cash on their balance sheet

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,540
or instead of paying a dividend, companies

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,560
will repurchase their shares so from a corporate finance

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,800
perspective, why do companies repurchase their shares?

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,770
So one good reason is that this is a way

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,650
to return cash to shareholders.

15
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,030
And it can be a tax efficient way of returning cash

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,430
as an alternative to dividends.

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:01,000
The intuition here is if I pay shareholders a dividend,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,489
everybody gets a dividend whether they want it or not.

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,200
And they all have to pay tax on it.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,410
When I repurchase stock, only people that

21
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,050
want to sell the stock, sell the stock.

22
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,660
Everybody else keeps the stock.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,760
So the people that keep the stock,

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,340
they don't pay any tax at that point.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,220
And the people that sell the stock, well maybe they

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,030
wanted to sell the stock anyway.

27
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,270
So from a corporate finance perspective,

28
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,900
repurchases are a tax advantage way

29
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,410
to return cash to shareholders.

30
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,940
Also some option plan-- so we give options to employees.

31
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,040
And we'll talk about this a little bit more later.

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,960
And those options are new shares, ordinarily.

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,470
But some companies or some shareholder groups

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,350
want the companies to control the amount of shares that

35
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,780
are given out in option plans.

36
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,840
And they require those companies that they can only

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,110
give shares and option plans if those shares have

38
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,160
been repurchased.

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,570
So that way option shares are not creating new shares.

40
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,200
They're just coming out of share repurchases.

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,480
And we'll talk about it later--

42
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,060
repurchases may increase earnings per share.

43
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,870
So particularly, as in right now,

44
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,410
when the yield on corporate cash is basically zero--

45
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,290
so you got a lot of cash sitting on your balance sheet.

46
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,900
It has no earnings.

47
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,920
So if you repurchase stock, it doesn't affect your income,

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,410
which is your earnings.

49
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,300
But it lowers your share count.

50
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,430
So it'll cause your earnings per share to go up.

51
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,300
So in certain environments, repurchases

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,440
can increase earnings per share.

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,790
And then finally, I'm a little skeptical about this.

54
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,290
But managers will always think their stock is undervalued.

55
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,870
So if you think your stock is undervalued,

56
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,950
it's a good use of corporate resources to buy stock back.

57
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,260
Because you're buying that stock back.

58
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,510
And you're in some sense, increasing

59
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,540
the value of the remaining stock, because the stock is

60
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,260
undervalued.

61
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,910
Now the accounting treatment, which is

62
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,570
what we're interested in here.

63
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,510
So I just gave you some intuition

64
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,490
for why this is done--

65
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,340
is the stock repurchase is going to be a use of cash.

66
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,400
And it's going to be a reduction in shareholders' equity.

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,315
So in no sense is treasury stock an asset.

68
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:34,970


69
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,520
So we'll see here, so AT&T repurchased about 67

70
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,090
million shares during 2019.

71
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,480
And it paid about $2.4 billion for those shares.

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,030
So when it did the repurchases, cash went down.

73
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,730
And then we have a new stockholders' equity account

74
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,100
here, which is treasury stock.

75
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,200
Notice the XE there.

76
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,060
That means that it's contra equity account.

77
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,010
So it's a reduction in equity.

78
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,780
So when we buy back treasury stock,

79
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,990
it reduces cash and also reduces stockholders' equity

80
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,654
through this contra equity account.

81
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:20,399


82
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,260
And we can see this also on the cash flow statement.

83
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,320
So this is AT&T's 2019 cash flow from financing.

84
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,340
So a line item on their cash flow from financing

85
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,320
shows that they spent $2.4 billion in cash.

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,200
So they use $2.4 billion in cash to repurchase stock.

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,880
Also on their balance sheet, and we saw this earlier,

88
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,640
there'll be a line item for this contra equity account.

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,860
Notice that the treasury stock is a negative amount.

90
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,800
So it's a contra equity.

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,070
So it reduces equity.

92
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,140
And it tells us that AT&T had about $8.4 billion shares

93
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,770
in treasury at the end of 2019.

94
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,790
And then the cost of those shares was $13 billion.

95
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:19,030
So over time, AT&T, as of the end of 2019,

96
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,270
had bought back $13 billion worth of their shares.

97
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,270
The final place you can see this going on

98
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,390
in the financial statements is in the changes

99
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,920
in the stockholders' equity account.

100
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,510
So AT&T shows that at the beginning of the year,

101
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,190
we had $12 billion in treasury.

102
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,690
So that's the right-hand column in their balance sheet.

103
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,590
So at the beginning of the year, we had $12 billion in treasury.

104
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,530
We repurchased and acquired $2 1/2 billion in stock--

105
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,420
$2.4 billion in repurchases and $75 million

106
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,660
in other stock acquisitions.

107
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,960
And then AT&T-- in the line below that, AT&T

108
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,980
is probably a company that uses treasury stock or stock

109
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,490
compensation.

110
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,810
So we reissued $1.4 billion worth of stock.

111
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,650
So overall at the end of the year, we had $13 billion

112
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,170
of stock in treasury.

113
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,270
Again the accounting for this--

114
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,230
once we got treasury stock, it can leave our balance sheet

115
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,050
in two ways.

116
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,080
So it can be reissued as we just saw AT&T do.

117
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,090
Often it's reissued as part of stock compensation plans,

118
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,560
or it can be retired.

119
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,940
So we can just get rid of it.

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,740
So we're going to focus on one treasury stock is reissued.

121
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,680
As we see here with AT&T, when they reissued

122
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,980
that stock, $1.466 billion--

123
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:05,920
the treasury stock contra equity account is reduced.

124
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,820
And then the chances are, the price we repurchase it at

125
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,710
and the price that we reissued it

126
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,730
that are going to be different.

127
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,730
So the difference in price--

128
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,080
we just take that difference, aggregate it, and add it

129
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,350
to additional paid-in capital.

130
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,820
Now very rarely, companies will retire treasury stocks.

131
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,940
So this is not on the exam.

132
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,080
When they retire it, obviously the treasury stock account

133
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,380
is going to be reduced with the amount of retirements.

134
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,470
And then depending on how it is retired,

135
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,810
we might reduce par value.

136
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,940
We might reduce the APIC.

137
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,790
And we might reduce retained earnings as well.

138
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:54,850
Now cash dividends-- let's imagine a firm has

139
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,250
1,000 shares outstanding.

140
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,010
And it pays a dividend of $2 a share

141
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,160
or declares a dividend of $2 a share.

142
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,660
So at the time we declare the dividend, dividends payable,

143
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,030
which is a liability, that goes up by $2 a share

144
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,880
times 1,000 shares outstanding.

145
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,510
And retained earnings but not net income, remember.

146
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,730
So retained earnings is going to be reduced

147
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,600
by the amount of the dividend.

148
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,800
Later in time, we'll actually pay the dividend.

149
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,250
And at that point, the cash will go down.

150
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,289
Dividends payable will go away.

151
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,140
So institutionally, we're going to declare a dividend.

152
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,360
And we're going to pay the dividend some time later.

153
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,000
And the reason for that is remember,

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,420
our stock is trading all the time.

155
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,680
So it's hard to know exactly who our shareholders are

156
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,580
at any point in time.

157
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,050
So after we declare a dividend, we do some work.

158
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,100
We figure out who is actually eligible to receive

159
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,230
that dividend, because they're stockholders at the time.

160
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,310
And then we send the dividend checks to those people.

161
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,490
That's the point at which cash goes down

162
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,590
and dividends payable goes away.

163
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,410
And so you can also see this on firms' cash flow

164
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,350
from financing in their cash flow statement.

165
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,290
So an AT&T's case, they paid $14 billion or $15 billion

166
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,930
worth of dividends in 2019, which is quite a bit larger

167
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,570
than the amount, the $2.4 billion

168
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,450
they spent on repurchasing treasury stock.

169
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,340
So AT&T is a big dividend payer.

170
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,930
They've got shareholders who historically,

171
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,770
are interested in getting a dividend from AT&T every year.

172
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,620
So AT&T is paying big amounts of dividends,

173
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,520
as you can see from their cash flow from financing statement.
