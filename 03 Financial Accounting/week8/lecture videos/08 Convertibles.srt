00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,417
PROFESSOR: And then that brings us

1
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:04,140
to the topic of hybrid security.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,250
So hybrid just means that the security has

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,280
an aspect of a liability, and it also

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,330
has an aspect of an equity.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,240
So you got convertible debt.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,880
Well, in certain situations that we'll talk about,

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,570
it looks like debt.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,000
But in other situations it'll turn into common stock.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,910
Convertible preferred stock, what we just talked about.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,100
In certain situations that looks like preferred stock.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,520
So it gets a big preferred dividend.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,540
But at some point, it's going to convert and turn

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,890
into common stock.

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,530
So if the convertible debt or the convertible preferred

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,890
is converted, it becomes stock.

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,220
If not, it's just like regular debt or regular preferred.

17
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,150
So why do companies issue convertible debt

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,070
and convertible preferred?

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,930
So one general reason is by giving the conversion feature

20
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,020
out, you get a reduced interest rate on the debt,

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,410
if it's a convertible debt.

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,140
And you're giving your bond holders the option

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,770
to buy equity in the future.

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,600
They value that option.

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,830
So they'll give you a reduced rate on debt.

26
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,010
And so lots of tech companies-- this is a Wall Street Journal

27
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,960
article from 2018--

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,380
lots of publicly-traded technology companies

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,930
have been issuing convertible debt.

30
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,700
And the pace that they are doing this--

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,510
remember, we're in a high valuation situation right now.

32
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,720
And this is the biggest high valuation situation

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,260
we've seen since the dot-com bubble.

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,670
And the reason that companies are

35
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,750
doing this is the cost of the debt is very low.

36
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,420
So convertible debt only cost 2 and 1/2% two years ago,

37
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,420
but the tech companies are only paying 1%.

38
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:02,320
So by giving up an option on their future equity,

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,270
they're getting super low interest rates on their debt.

40
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,620
So it's a way for them to issue debt

41
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,440
at a very low cost of capital.

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,560
So to make this a little clearer, let's do an example.

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,510
So this is a pretend company, ABC Company.

44
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,690
It issues $100 million convertible bond

45
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,080
or convertible debt.

46
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,540
We're sitting in 2015.

47
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:32,520
The bond issue matures in five years, in 2020.

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,180
So the convertible bond has an interest rate, or coupon,

49
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,370
of 2%.

50
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,740
Had ABC issued straight debt--

51
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,740
so debt without any conversion feature--

52
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,640
the cost of that straight debt would have been 5% coupon rate.

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,510
So by adding the conversion feature,

54
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,730
ABC is saving 3% in interest expense, cash.

55
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,900
And that's the difference between the 5%

56
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,420
they would have paid on straight debt minus the 2%

57
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,180
that they're paid on this convertible.

58
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,840
So, again, bond owners like the conversion option.

59
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,040
So bondholders take the conversion option.

60
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,730
And in return, they'll give the company

61
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,000
a lower rate on its debt.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,300
When ABC issued the bonds, the stock price was at $80 a share,

63
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,540
and the bonds converted a conversion price

64
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,680
of $100 a share, or 25% above the current price.

65
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,000
So this is going to vary depending on the issue,

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,040
but it's typical that the conversion

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,650
price is about 25% or 30% greater than the current price.

68
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,810
So if these bonds converted, they

69
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,040
would turn into an additional 1 million shares.

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,240
So this example just makes the math simple.

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,450
So $100 million of debt divided by $100 per share conversion

72
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,410
price--

73
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,500
that tells you that these bonds turn into an additional 1

74
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,090
million shares.

75
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,370
Now let's think about what would happen at maturity.

76
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,920
So maturity is 2020.

77
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,170
What would the stockholders do if the stock price at that time

78
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,000
is less than $100?

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,380
So if the stock price is less than $100,

80
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,670
those million shares times a price less than $100

81
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,198
are going to be less than $100 million.

82
00:04:37,198 --> 00:04:40,120
And the debt holders had their choice

83
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,600
of either getting cash of $100 million

84
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,980
or stock that's worth less than $100 million.

85
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,950
So clearly, they're going to take the cash.

86
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,090
And the convertible debt ends up being regular debt.

87
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,440
So it has to be paid off in cash like regular debt is.

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,800
Now, on the other hand, what happens if the stock

89
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,620
price is above $100?

90
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,330
So in that case, we can turn the bonds into shares.

91
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,130
And those million shares will be worth more than $100 million.

92
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,320
So we're smart bondholders.

93
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,470
We're going to take the shares, and those million shares

94
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,410
are going to be worth up more than $100 million.

95
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,230
So in that case, the debt has turned into equity.

96
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,170
So depending on where the stock price is at maturity,

97
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,920
convertible debt can be either like debt

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,450
or it can be like equity.

99
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,110
In terms of accounting for this, if the stock price

100
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,530
is less than $100, it's debt.

101
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,320
And the company is going to have to come up with $100 million

102
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,100
in cash and the convertible debt is going

103
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,300
to drop off our balance sheet.

104
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,470
So that's a disadvantage, the convertible debt,

105
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,760
because if you're a tech-y company,

106
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,070
you may not have a lot of cash.

107
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,880
But all of a sudden at maturity, because your stock price

108
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,130
doesn't perform very well, you've

109
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,340
got to come up with $100 million worth of cash.

110
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,710
On the other hand, if your stock has done well

111
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,140
and it's above $100, you're not going to pay out any cash.

112
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,900
The convertible debt is going to go away.

113
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,600
And then to balance the balance sheet equation,

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,990
we'll take the $100 million of convertible debt

115
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,530
and turn it into stock and put that $100 million

116
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,010
into contributed capital.

117
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,250
So in this case, we don't have to pay out

118
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,130
any cash, which is great.

119
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,105
Contributed capital goes up by $100 million.

120
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:56,350
The disadvantage here is that, notice, the shares outstanding

121
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,830
does increase by a million shares.

122
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,360
Now in terms of accounting for the convertible debt at issue--

123
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,570
and this is specialized, so it's not on the exam.

124
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,440
But we're going to come back and look at this in Tesla

125
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,090
at the very end of the course.

126
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,400
So there are two ways to do it.

127
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,630
So we just argued that convertible debt--

128
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,270
it's kind of like a liability, and it's

129
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,970
kind of like an equity.

130
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,690
So it makes sense, in some sense, when you actually

131
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:34,600
stuff to put some value in debt and put some value in equity.

132
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,870
And that's what's done in IFRS.

133
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,150
It's also done in the US, in very specialized cases.

134
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,030
And we'll see an example of this when we look

135
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,380
at Tesla, again, at the end of the course.

136
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,990
And the way to account for this is we're

137
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,470
going to value the liability first and then

138
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,000
assign the rest of the value to the equity.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,200
So we'll just do what we did in the bond class--

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,230
is value of the bond as if it's a discount bond.

141
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,610
Notice that it has a 2% cash coupon,

142
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,860
but we've got 5% interest rate in the marketplace.

143
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,990
So the bond is issued at a discount.

144
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,110
That's going to be less than the face value of the bond.

145
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,010
We'll take the excess of the face amount

146
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,590
over the discount bond and we're going

147
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,370
to assign that to equity, which is conversion value, which

148
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,970
will be added to contributed capital.

149
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:38,390
So, to me, what IFRS is doing here

150
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,260
makes a lot of sense because, again, the convertible debt--

151
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,179
it kind of looks like debt.

152
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,305
It kind of looks like equity.

153
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:47,930
So when we issue it, we're going to put

154
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,090
some of the value in debt and put

155
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,100
some of the value in equity.

156
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,590
But this is clearly complicated.

157
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:02,220
So what the FASB does in the US is just do a single liability.

158
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,670
So we're just going to-- we issued $100 million

159
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,110
worth of debt.

160
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,720
We're going to put $100 million worth of debt on our balance

161
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,590
sheet.

162
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,490
We are not going to do anything to contributed capital.

163
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,550
And in fact, sometimes the FASB really

164
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,950
just kills me because they're just heading

165
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,490
in the wrong direction here.

166
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,060
So this is a lot simpler, but they're

167
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,460
going to require that all convertible debt be

168
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,940
just assigned as if it were a liability.

169
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,170
So they're forgetting the fact that, again,

170
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,680
with convertible debt-- it's got features of a liability

171
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,135
and it's got features of equity.

172
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:43,410


173
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,620
And then, in practice-- again, this is not on the exam--

174
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,540
but in practice, you can tell from a context

175
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,180
how the company accounts for the convertible debt.

176
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,630
So in the US, it typically is done as a single liability.

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,330
But you'll also see in special cases,

178
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,270
as in Tesla, they are actually splitting it

179
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,570
into a debt component and an equity component.
