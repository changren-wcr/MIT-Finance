00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
PROFESSOR: So our objective in this class

1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,950
is to get a better understanding of the components

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,200
of shareholders' equity.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,530
So we've seen a lot of these already.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,890
So some of this is going to be review.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,190
But we're going to also introduce some wrinkles,

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,660
a little bit of new material.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,610
So shareholders' equity consists of contributing capital.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,670
So when we buy--

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,170
when we sell stock to people, that's contributed capital.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,080
Sometimes, companies buy their stock back.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,420
That's called treasury stock.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,110
And we're going to look at how the financial statements

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,990
reflect a variety of corporate equity transactions.

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,850
So we'll start by looking at stock offerings, how

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,180
you account for a sale of stock to the public.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,040
Something called stock splits--

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,900
we'll talk about that.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,200
We'll talk about, again, stock repurchases

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,900
when companies buy back their shares.

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,480
We're going to talk a little bit about using stock and options.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,690
Options are a form of stock compensation.

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,840
So how firms use stock compensation

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,700
and how we do the accounting for that.

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,700
And then we're also going to talk about what

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,520
are called hybrid securities.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,110
So debt that converts into stock or preferred stock that

27
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,590
converts into stock That's called convertible debt

28
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,780
and convertible preferred.

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,480
Those securities are hybrids because they

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,560
look like debt in some ways, but they can turn into equity.

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,680
Here's a picture or a flowchart of shareholders' equity.

32
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,730
So if we start on the far right column here--

33
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,580
notice that we've already talked about other comprehensive

34
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,950
income and we saw that with available for sale securities,

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,540
there's going to be an accumulation

36
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,150
of other comprehensive income related

37
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,060
to those available for sale securities.

38
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,503
We've talked throughout the course about retained earnings.

39
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:05,920
We've talked throughout the course

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,710
about contributed capital.

41
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,430
We're going to introduce the accounting in a few minutes

42
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,650
for treasury stock.

43
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,670
And then we're going to break contributed capital down into--

44
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,730
some contributed capital comes from common stock.

45
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,380
Some firms will issue a form of stock called preferred stock.

46
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,430
We'll talk about that later.

47
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,430
And then we'll talk about how each

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,040
of these forms of contributed capital

49
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,110
have both a par value and then the acronym APIC, which is

50
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,940
the additional paid in capital.

51
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,690
So we're going to do some examples of that

52
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,930
on the next slides.

53
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,000
