1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,000
PROFESSOR: So now we're going to talk about stock splits.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,210
This is kind of a specialty topic.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,700
But those of you that go into research,

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,590
you're going to see that stock splits

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,020
can cause a lot of problems.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,130
So we're going to talk about the accounting for stock splits.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,380
So companies sometimes are going to split their shares.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,060
So if we do a two for one split, that

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,330
means that everybody that owns one share will

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,560
get another share.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,700
And they'll own two shares.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,000
So what happens then is the number of shares outstanding

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,260
will double.

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,590
Par value will fall by 50%.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,490
And the price per share will also fall by 50%.

16
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,300
So in our example here, Sloan Company

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,030
has 1,000 shares outstanding.

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,400
They have a dollar par value.

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,250
And the price at the time of the split is $120.

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,420
So if the company does a two for one split, what happens?

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,900
How many shares will they have outstanding after the split?

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,450
So the number of shares will double.

23
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,210
So shares outstanding will go from 1,000 to 2,000.

24
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,790
What will happen to their dollar par value?

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,540
So that will be cut in half or divided by 2.

26
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,380
So the par value is going to be $0.50,

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,160
which is the dollar par value before the split divided

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,590
by the split of two shares.

29
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,020
And then finally, what's going to happen to the stock price?

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,310
So the stock price was $120.

31
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,410
It's going to be divided by 2 as well.

32
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,510
So the stock price is going to go to $60, which

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,640
is $120 divided by 2.

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,660
Now, notice here from an economic perspective,

35
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,750
nothing happened.

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,470
Before the split, we had 1,000 shares outstanding.

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,660
They were worth $120 a share.

38
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,120
So the company had a market value of $120,000.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,970
After the split, we have 2,000 shares outstanding.

40
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,600
They're only worth $60 a share.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,650
2,000 times 60 is also $120,000.

42
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,800
So company value in total hasn't changed.

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,390
So it's an economic--

44
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,730
it's a nonissue in some sense.

45
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:29,230
So if it's a nonissue, why do investors and management

46
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,080
view stock splits positively?

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, historically, by splitting your stock,

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,030
if you got a stock price of $120 in this example,

49
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,800
people might look at it, retail buyers which are just

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,990
small people like me and you.

51
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,240
Retail buyers might look at the stock price

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,780
and say $120 is too much.

53
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,300
After we split the stock, the same buyers

54
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,270
might say, oh, $60 is much more in my price range.

55
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:06,000
So it can create the perception of a more affordable price.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,760
It may be signaling from management.

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,910
So if management expects the stock price

58
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,150
to keep going up and up, then it might make sense

59
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,590
to split the stock.

60
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,490
So it could be a signal from management that we expect--

61
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,690
management expects the stock price to keep going up and up.

62
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,710
And then finally, this is an important point here.

63
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,380
If you're a poorly performing company,

64
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,720
your stock price is going down and down,

65
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,930
it falls under $1, that's at the point

66
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,560
that you become a penny stock so to speak.

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,420
And that's important because a lot

68
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,170
of stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange

69
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,410
will delist you if your price falls below $1.

70
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,310
So in this example recently Aurora Cannabis,

71
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,400
which is a New York Stock Exchange company,

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,310
it did a reverse split.

73
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,020
So it says at the top there we're

74
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,118
going to do a reverse split, one for 12 reverse split.

75
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,660
I'm going to round these numbers just

76
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,580
to make the algebra a little easy.

77
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,300
So right now the company's got 1.2 billion shares outstanding.

78
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,410
If we do a one for 12 reverse split,

79
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,070
we'll have about 100 million shares outstanding.

80
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,700
So a reverse split, instead of making more shares,

81
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,010
you're making fewer shares.

82
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,330
And the key to this is that the time

83
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,700
of the split, Aurora Cannabis had a share price of $0.71.

84
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,840
If we split-- if we reverse split that-- excuse me--

85
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:49,250
one for 12, $0.71 is going to turn into about $8.50 split.

86
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,320
And again, the reason this is important

87
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,040
is because New York Stock Exchange, which

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,230
is thought to be probably the best stock

89
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,670
exchange in the United States, to be on the New York Stock

90
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,050
Exchange, the stock price has to be at least $1 a share.

91
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,670
If you trade below $1 share for 30 days consecutively,

92
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,100
the New York Stock Exchange will delist

93
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,430
you, which means you'll no longer be on the New York Stock

94
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,480
Exchange.

95
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,750
It will be harder for people to trade your stock.

96
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,250
And it'll be really bad for--

97
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,540
it's really bad for a company's stock if it's delisted.

98
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,300
So we're going to do a reverse stock split--

99
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,640
or Aurora Cannabis in this example

100
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,070
is doing a reverse stock split--

101
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,920
to avoid being delisted by the New York Stock Exchange.

102
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,290
Now, this is a sort of specialty thing.

103
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,780
You don't see that many reverse splits

104
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,660
except for cases like this when the company's really

105
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,540
doing poorly.

106
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,600
A more common occurrence is a retail stock like Starbucks.

107
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,530
So everybody knows what Starbucks is.

108
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,620
It's the coffee company.

109
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,840
Lots of retail investors own Starbucks.

110
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,020
So Starbucks over its history has split two

111
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,660
for one six different times.

112
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,960
So the most recent time it split two for one was back in 2015.

113
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:23,370
And at that time, Starbucks had 1.5 billion shares outstanding.

114
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,190
After the split, it had 1.5 billion shares outstanding.

115
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,360
So how many shares did it have outstanding immediately

116
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,100
before the split?

117
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,750
Well, it had half as many outstanding.

118
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,270
So it's a two for one split.

119
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,630
So to figure out how many outstanding before the split,

120
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:46,790
we'll take 1,501 divided by 2 so about 750 million.

121
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:52,470
If the price was about $48 immediately after the split,

122
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,940
what was the price immediately before the split?

123
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,090
So again, take $47.96.

124
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,500
Multiply by 2.

125
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
It was about $96 a share.

126
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,570
So here, you can sort of see the intuition

127
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:12,350
for why Starbucks as a retail stock, maybe $95

128
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,550
seems too high a stock price for their retail stock buyers.

129
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,260
We split the stock.

130
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,140
Now the price is $48 a share.

131
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,490
It seems more affordable.

132
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,260
So the reason this is important, stock splits are important,

133
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,600
those of you that are going to go into research,

134
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,700
is shown by the following example from Starbucks.

135
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,180
So Starbucks went public back in 1992.

136
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,440
So its IPO was June 26, 1992.

137
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,320
And at close of trading on that first day,

138
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,070
Starbucks stock price was $21.50.

139
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:54,730
So if we do a naive calculation of total return

140
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:01,590
through December 31, 2019, when Starbucks price was $88,

141
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,290
it looks like Starbucks has basically

142
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,070
tripled in price since then or quadrupled in price since then.

143
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,290
So we have a 300% return since 1992.

144
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,400
And that seems like a big amount of money.

145
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,010
But notice that the S&P 500 during that time is up 700%.

146
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,140
So the S&P 500 has gone up by a factor of seven

147
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,060
whereas Starbucks by this calculation

148
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,580
has only gone up by a factor of 3.

149
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,909
So what's wrong with this calculation

150
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,650
is it misses the fact that Starbucks stock has split two

151
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,140
for one six times.

152
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,200
So that means that you had a share of stock, at the IPO,

153
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,100
if you had one share stock, it turned into two shares.

154
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,220
Then it turned into four shares, et cetera, et cetera.

155
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,940
But now if you bought one share of the IPO,

156
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,770
you've got 64 shares now.

157
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,820
So the right way to do the calculation is

158
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,670
you got to go back in time and split

159
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,040
adjust the first day close.

160
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,500
So the first day close apples to apples with prices now,

161
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,030
you take the first close of $21.50 divided by the split

162
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,860
factor of 64.

163
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,050
So basically, Starbucks came public at $0.34 a share

164
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,570
based on today's stock price.

165
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,740
Then if we do the correct calculation of the total return

166
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,940
to somebody that bought stock on the first day close,

167
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,700
we'll take the $88 price today divided by $0.34.

168
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,620
Subtract off one.

169
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,540
So that's a total return of 26,000%.

170
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,940
So you made 26 times your money in Starbucks.

171
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,390
So Starbucks is a top performer.

172
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,850
It's one of the best performers in the S&P 500.

173
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,950
And notice that is beating the daylights out of the S&P 500

174
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,340
in general.

175
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:14,820
So why this is important, again, is data providers.

176
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,400
You have to as a researcher understand

177
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,180
how data providers are accounting for stock splits.

178
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,400
And the reason this is important is

179
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,940
that there are certain types of firms that tend to split a lot.

180
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,630
They're companies like Starbucks that are top performers.

181
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,520
So a bad performer like we looked

182
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,180
at earlier, Aurora Cannabis, it's not going to be doing

183
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,840
splits.

184
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,270
Or it might be doing reverse splits,

185
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,800
but it's not increasing its shares.

186
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,790
And if you fail to account for these splits,

187
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,600
you're going to do an improper calculation.

188
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
And you're going to understate the return performance

189
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,030
of your top performers.

190
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,010
So in most databases that researchers

191
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,850
use such as the Center for Research and Stock

192
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,610
Prices or CRSP, prices given are historical prices.

193
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,380
So you go on CRSP.

194
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,010
You'll find that Starbucks' closing price as of June 26,

195
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,930
1992, was $21.50 a share.

196
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,600
But in a separate column, CRSP is

197
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,330
going to give you a split factor of 64.

198
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,540
So the total adjustment factors we saw a minute ago is 64.

199
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,420
And so if you understand the structure,

200
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,040
it's easy to compute the split-adjusted price of $0.34.

201
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,010
And it's easy to correctly compute

202
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,040
the total return for Starbucks.

203
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,630
And this is just something to be careful about.

204
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,540
So you want to really be careful when they're

205
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,590
splits are involved because not all databases are going

206
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,880
to adjust in the same way.

207
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,930
And if you don't do the adjustments correctly,

208
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,660
you'll look at a top performer like Starbucks

209
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,900
that looks like it's not performing very well.

210
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:12,110
And a 25,000% return as Starbucks

211
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,420
got, that's going to drive a lot of performance evaluation.

212
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,860
If you turn that into a 300% return, it's just wrong.

213
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,050
You're going to get the wrong result.

214
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,200
And this has caused some pretty famous academics

215
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,950
to publish papers that are just wrong because they haven't done

216
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,880
the split adjustment correctly.
