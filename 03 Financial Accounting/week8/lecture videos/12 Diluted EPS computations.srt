0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
PROFESSOR: Now for diluted EPS, we're

1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,020
going to take net income available

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,470
to common shareholders in the denominator.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,610
And we're going to add things back.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,730
And then in terms of shares outstanding,

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,640
we're going to take weighted average shares outstanding

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,750
and add to that average diluted shares outstanding.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,070
So again, net income available to common shareholders

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,409
is net income minus net income of attributable noncontrolling

9
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:37,190
interest minus preferred dividends.

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,710
We're going to add back convertible preferred dividends

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,180
and aftertax convertible debt interest.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,240
So if there are any convertibles outstanding,

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,980
what we're going to do is pretend that they convert.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,100
And so once they convert, we'll no longer

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,830
have a convertible preferred dividend.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,250
We'll no longer have debt interest.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,160
Remember, debt is tax deductible.

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,840
Convertible preferred dividends are not.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,460
So we're just going to add back after-tax interest,

20
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,670
and then we're going to divide that by diluted shares.

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,540
And the diluted shares are stock options

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,050
that are assumed to convert and convertible securities

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,500
that are assumed convert.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,700
And we're going to do two examples.

25
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,380
First, we're going to look at convertible securities.

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,070
So let's just pretend, in addition

27
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,670
to our calculations above for basic EPS,

28
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,140
let's pretend that the $200,000 preferred dividend comes

29
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,300
from a convertible preferred stock,

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,250
and then let's pretend that this convertible can be converted

31
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,730
into 150,000 shares of stock.

32
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,780
So diluted shares for convertibles, the accounting

33
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,990
term is if converted.

34
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,590
So we basically assume that at the start of the year,

35
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,400
the convertible converted into stock.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,210
So therefore, there's no dividends

37
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,130
or no interest on that convert.

38
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,350
So in this case, if that convert converted

39
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,340
to the start of the year, we would add to basic shares

40
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,410
outstanding 150,000 diluted shares associated

41
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,000
with the convertible.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,520
So our average shares outstanding

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,830
would go up to 639,000 diluted shares,

44
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,340
and then we compute diluted EPS as the sum

45
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,450
of net income available to common

46
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,590
plus the preferred dividend divided by diluted shares

47
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,250
outstanding.

48
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,370
And that gives us a diluted EPS number of $1.88.

49
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,120
So diluted EPS is always going to be less than

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,000
or equal to basic EPS.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,570
Now let's look at options.

52
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,240
And just to keep things simple, let's

53
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,200
pretend that we don't have that convert after all,

54
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,580
but we have some options outstanding.

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,450
And in fact, over the course of the year,

56
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,320
average options outstanding were 25,000.

57
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,410
They had an exercise price at $20.

58
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,280
And the average market price associated with those options

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,895
was $50.

60
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:41,980


61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,830
So here, we're going to use something

62
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,180
in accounting terms called the treasury stock method.

63
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,600
So these options are in the money,

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,610
which means that the market price per share of $50

65
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,420
is greater than the exercise price per share.

66
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,600
And so the treasury stock method means

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,500
that we're going to pretend that the option was exercised,

68
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,950
and then we're going to use the proceeds from the exercise

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,470
to repurchase stock.

70
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,190
And the diluted shares associated with those options

71
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,279
are equal to the number of options

72
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,200
minus the deemed or assumed amount of repurchases.

73
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,150
So let's continue our example.

74
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,290
Here's the treasury stock method.

75
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,800
So if these 25,000 shares options

76
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,950
were exercised at an exercise price of $20,

77
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,740
then when the options are exercised,

78
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,520
the firm would get $500,000.

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,210
Second step is we're going to pretend that the firm takes

80
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,940
that $500,000 and uses it to repurchase shares at $50

81
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,790
a share so it could repurchase 10,000 shares.

82
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,130
So the net effect of the options will be 25,000 more shares.

83
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,920
But we're going to repurchase 10,000 of those shares.

84
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,780
So net new shares would be 15,000.

85
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,430
We add those to the basic shares outstanding and come up

86
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,780
with 504,000 shares outstanding, and then

87
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,730
that gives our diluted EPS, which again

88
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,680
is net income available to common shareholders divided

89
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,390
by diluted shares outstanding.

90
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,110
So that gives us $1.98.

91
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,680
Then looking again at Twitter, so

92
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,560
in their financial statements, they'll

93
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,820
show you the basic EPS computation, which

94
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,880
is at the top of this table.

95
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,050
And then they'll show you the diluted EPS computation, which

96
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,600
is the bottom of the table.

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:11,060
So again, their net income for 2020 was a billion 2.

98
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,100
They had 754 million shares outstanding,

99
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,690
basic shares, average shares outstanding, basic shares.

100
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,780
That gives us basic net income per share of $1.60.

101
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,370
Next comes the diluted EPS calculation.

102
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,120
So the numerator, which is net income, because Twitter

103
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,730
has no converts outstanding, numerator's

104
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,770
going to be the same for basic and for diluted EPS.

105
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,100
And to compute diluted shares, we

106
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,740
take basic shares of 750,000, add shares associated

107
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,370
with restricted stock, add shares associated

108
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,360
with stock options, add other diluted shares outstanding.

109
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,870
So that gives us a bigger number diluted shares

110
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,940
than the basic shares.

111
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:17,640
And so diluted net income is $1.56 versus basic net income

112
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,060
of $1.60.

113
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,880
And, again, when there's a net loss,

114
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,910
we assume there's no change in diluted shares.

115
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,750
So that's why you got those dashes

116
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:37,940
under affects the diluted securities in 2017 and 2018.

117
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,050
Because we're not computing any diluted shares in those years,

118
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,740
net loss per share basic is the same

119
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,070
as net loss per share diluted.

120
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:54,060
So in summary and in takeaways, we've

121
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,580
talked a lot about stockholders' equity.

122
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,150
We talked in particular about transactions

123
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,620
that can affect stockholders' equity.

124
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,360
So first of all, we talked about stock issuances.

125
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,520
Then we talked about repurchases.

126
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,650
We talked about stock splits.

127
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,990
We talked about dividends.

128
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,650
We talked a little bit about stock compensation,

129
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,840
basically vesting provisions and how

130
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,370
that affects the expense of stock compensation,

131
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,060
and then we talked about convertible debt

132
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,030
and convertible preferred.

133
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,530
Now, a growing company like a Twitter,

134
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:41,720
a growing company like a Tesla, are always

135
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,540
going to be looking to raise cash.

136
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,510
And they're going to raise that cash in different ways

137
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,780
depending on market circumstances

138
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,190
and economic realities.

139
00:08:53,190 --> 00:09:01,110
So a serial issuer like Tesla has lots of stuff going on.

140
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,610
But you can use their financial statements.

141
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,290
And we're going to do this in the last class.

142
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,090
We can use their financial statement, the cash flow

143
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,780
statement in particular and the balance sheet,

144
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,690
to see what they're doing in terms of corporate finance

145
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,920
activities.

146
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,640
And we care about this because we're stockholders.

147
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,940
We want to understand where the money is coming from

148
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,130
and where the money is going to run the company.
