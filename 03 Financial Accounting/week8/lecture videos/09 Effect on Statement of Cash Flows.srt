00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
PROFESSOR: So we've looked a lot,

1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,010
as we've been talking about stockholder's equity,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,710
about how changes in equity show up

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,880
in the same in the cash flows.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,180
So let's just summarize that briefly here.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,110
So in terms of the cash flow from operations,

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:22,190
as we saw in the Amazon case, if we give stock compensation,

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,470
that's a non-cash item.

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,200
It's a reduction in net income, but we're

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,760
going to add it back to net income

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,320
to compute cash flow from operations.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,380
In terms of cash flow from financing,

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,960
we're going to see the proceeds from the issuance of stock

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,410
as we saw with Tesla.

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,210
We're going to see the proceeds from option exercises

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,670
we'll see in just a second.

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,250
We'll see proceeds from issuance of debt

17
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,870
as we saw in our debt discussions earlier.

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,220
We're going to see stock repurchases.

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,850
We're going to see debt maturities,

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,520
so if debt matures and we have to pay out the debt,

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,490
we'll see that in the cash flow from financing.

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,910
And we'll also see debt repurchases.

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,800
So in the case of Tesla, if we were

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,570
to look at their 2017 cash flow statement, at the top there,

25
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,350
you see we're adding back stock compensation expense.

26
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,600
Tesla had stock compensation expense in 2017

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,820
of about $467 million.

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,700
That's a non-cash item.

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,510
You can see in the cash flow from financing,

30
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,650
we see the proceeds from common stock and public offerings.

31
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,060
We see issues of debt, we see repayments of debt,

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,360
we see stock option exercises, and we also

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,540
see transactions related to capital leases, as well.
