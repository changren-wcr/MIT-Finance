1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,097
INSTRUCTOR: So now I want to talk a little bit

2
00:00:02,097 --> 00:00:04,800
about other types of equity.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,740
We're going to talk some about stock compensation,

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,610
stock options, and restricted stock.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,580
We're going to talk just a little bit about preferred

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,910
stock.

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,050
And then we're going to talk a bit also

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,990
about hybrid securities, which are

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,550
convertible debt and convertible preferred stock.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,000
So when we talked about cash flow,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,750
we talked about stock compensation.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,320
And the key thing is the line at the bottom there.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,410
When we give an employee stock, we're

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,900
going to increase contributed capital.

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,390
And then we're going to have a wage expense.

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,150
And then we talked about the idea

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,460
that if you pay somebody in stock,

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,900
it's very similar to selling some stock to an outsider

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,750
and then pay the employee in cash.

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,540
I want to just give you one wrinkle

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,880
on this, which is vesting.

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,850
So I gave you $1,000 worth of stock.

23
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,550
And it's going to vest over three years.

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,550
What that means is that if you're still

25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,080
with the company a year from now,

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,200
you'll get 1/3 of the stock.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,180
If you're still with the company two years from now,

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,000
you'll get another 1/3.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,430
And if you're still with a company in three years,

30
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,170
you get the remaining 1/3.

31
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,460
So you've got to remain at the company for three years

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,830
to get that full $1,000.

33
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,920
So if you leave, if you're the employee

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,830
and you leave before the stock vests,

35
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,095
you're going to forfeit or give up that stock.

36
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:46,710


37
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,970
So the way the accounting system works on this,

38
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,270
I give somebody $1,000 worth of stock.

39
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,760
But there's three years' worth of vesting.

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,250
So by the matching principle, we're

41
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,300
going to divide the expense of $1,000 in total

42
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,740
and make that a $333 expense per year.

43
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,700
Because we're trying to match the expense to the value

44
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,650
that I'm getting out of you, which

45
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,410
takes place over a three-year period.

46
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,530
In terms of the balance sheet equation,

47
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,200
basically what's going to happen,

48
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,570
in the first year when you vest in $333 worth of stock,

49
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,680
contributed capital is going to go up by $333.

50
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,820
We're going to have wage expense of $333.

51
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,700
Similarly in the second year, and then

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,080
similarly in the third year.

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
So vesting is a way for companies

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,870
to keep their employees.

55
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,570
So the employee has to stay for three years

56
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,340
to get all their stock.

57
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,250
But it's also a technique that companies use

58
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,350
to spread stock compensation.

59
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,690
So I'm giving you stock right now,

60
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,600
but I'm spreading the expense of that stock

61
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,220
over a three-year period.

62
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,310
Because I'm vesting it over that three-year period.

63
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,670
And then notice that if we vest like this

64
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,280
and we grant every year stock compensation for a given year,

65
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,100
it's going to have some expense for this year,

66
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,820
some expense for last year, and then some expense for the year

67
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,050
before that.

68
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,000
Remember, we saw a similar example

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,320
of this when we were calculating software amortization

70
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,470
expense in our discussion of intangible assets.

71
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,080
And then companies that give out stock or equity,

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,220
like Tesla, are required to have disclosure

73
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,590
in their 10-K for how much stock that they gain.

74
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,420
So this disclosure is for Tesla's option

75
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,920
and compensation.

76
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,440
It shows you how many options they had outstanding

77
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,240
at the start of the year.

78
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,720
It shows you that they granted an additional 1.1 million

79
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,100
options.

80
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,200
Employees exercised options for about 2 million shares.

81
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,150
And then the options that are canceled

82
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,360
are probably because the employees left and they weren't

83
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,940
fully vested in those options.

84
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,240
So what this tells us is that, again, Tesla

85
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,870
granted about 1.2 million options.

86
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,990
The average exercise price of those options was about $310.

87
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,860
And typically, stock options give employees

88
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,070
the right to buy, in this case, Tesla stock

89
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,510
at a price of $310 for the next 10 years.

90
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,860
Because Tesla in particular is going up very rapidly.

91
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,830
What it tells you is that 10 years from now,

92
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,510
Tesla stock price is probably going to be way above $310.

93
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,130
And employees, at that point, can

94
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,010
exercise their stock options.

95
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,330
They can pay $310 a share for stock that's worth

96
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,360
maybe $1,000 a share right now.

97
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,970
Also in the 10-K--

98
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,480
and this is not on the exam, but just so that you understand

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,260
the disclosure a little bit--

100
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,790
the company is going to value those options.

101
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,670
And they're going to value based on something called the Black

102
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,130
Scholes model, which you're going to learn about

103
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,350
in your finance classes.

104
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,890
For the Black Scholes value of those options that it shows

105
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,440
there is $122.

106
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,960
So even though the exercise price

107
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:46,880
is $300, the options themselves, Tesla values them at $122.

108
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,530
So if Tesla gave out 1.2 million options

109
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,920
as they did this year, and the options each

110
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,690
have a value of $122, the value of the options granted

111
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,370
was $142 million.

112
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,120
And then again, back to vesting provisions.

113
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,340
So in 2017, this is just an example of vesting provisions,

114
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,450
Tesla granted a huge number, $1.1 billion

115
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,300
worth of stock and options to its employees.

116
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,870
So if Tesla is using a three-year vesting

117
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,040
period, which is probably close to what they're doing,

118
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,720
the expense in 2017 of this grant

119
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,610
is going to be $1.1 billion divided by a three-year vesting

120
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,880
period, or about $0.4 billion a year.

121
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,500
And again, Tesla probably granting options every year.

122
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,130
So this year's stock compensation expense

123
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,370
will have something to do with this year's option grant,

124
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,310
something to do with last year's option grant,

125
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,490
and also something to do with the year before option grant

126
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,190
as well.
