00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,458
PROFESSOR: So the next slide, we're

1
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:05,760
going to start talking about common stock, how it's divided

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,350
into par value, and how it's divided into APIC,

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,630
or additional paid in capital.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,010
So as we talked about before, common stock

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,910
is the basic residual ownership share in the corporation.

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,670
So our balance sheet equation is assets minus liabilities

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,040
equals stockholders' equity.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,630
And we've talked about before how

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,530
that means that if the firm is liquidated,

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,930
the assets will be sold.

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,700
First, the liability holders will get their payments.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,430
And then if there's anything left over,

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,170
the residual amounts--

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,260
and residual here means the amount left over.

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,590
The residual value after we paid off

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:59,390
all the liabilities, all the debt, all the preferred stock.

17
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,020
Then the common stock will get any value left over.

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,580
So that's one thing that distinguishes common stock.

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,860
The other thing that distinguishes common stock

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,320
is, remember, the common stockholders

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,150
own the corporation.

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,730
And because they own the corporation,

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,440
they get votes on certain corporate issues.

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,550
So if the company is going to be sold to another company,

25
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,490
for example, the common stockholders

26
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,320
will vote on whether they think the payment in that merger

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,480
and acquisition is appropriate.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,600
So that's background on common stock.

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,010
So again, from the prior slide, common stock's

30
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,470
divided into something called par value.

31
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,550
And then what's left over after par value

32
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,860
is something else, called additional

33
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,860
paid in capital or APIC.

34
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,510
And then par value is the stated value

35
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,850
on the face of the security.

36
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,230
And what it is--

37
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,850
and then some companies have no par value.

38
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,260
So there's some companies out there with no par value stock.

39
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,539
Other companies that have a dollar par

40
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,630
value or a thousandth of $1 par value.

41
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:19,370
So par value, 50 years ago, used to mean something, OK?

42
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,710
And then the fact that it's around now,

43
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,650
it's just sort of like a historical artifact.

44
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,330
It doesn't really mean anything now.

45
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,200
So just take the par value as given,

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,350
and use it to record stock transactions,

47
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,230
as we'll do an example of here in just a minute.

48
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,870
And then additional paid in capital, or APIC,

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,050
is just the difference between if we sell stock,

50
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,820
we raise some money.

51
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,890
First, we're going to assign some of that value

52
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,310
to par value.

53
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,040
And then everything left over is going

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,600
to go to additional paid in capital.

55
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,750
And we'll see some examples of this starting with this.

56
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,390
So here's AT&T's 2019 10-K again,

57
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,560
and I've blown up here the stockholders' equity section.

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,850
So it is required that a company tells you

59
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,460
in their stockholders' equity section what

60
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,200
their par value is.

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,760
Here, you can see that AT&T has $1 par value.

62
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,970
And it's also required that the company tells you

63
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,100
how many shares they have issued.

64
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,530
So AT&T has issued 7.6 billion shares,

65
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,560
or 7,621 million shares.

66
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,540
So if we take that dollar par value times

67
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,640
the 7.6 billion shares issued, common stock on their balance

68
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,900
sheet, which is the third box there, of 7,621 million.

69
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,140
That's how they come up with a common stock value.

70
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,200
Also on the face of the balance sheet,

71
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,430
companies are required to tell you how much common stock

72
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,260
they're authorized to issue.

73
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,770
So in AT&T's case, they're authorized

74
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,350
to issue 14 billion shares.

75
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,830
We've already seen a minute ago that they've actually

76
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,890
issued 7.6 billion shares.

77
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,680
And then we'll talk in a minute about Treasury

78
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,180
stock, which is they've got Treasury stock, or stock

79
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,530
that they've repurchased over time, of 0.4 billion shares.

80
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,950


81
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,600
Continuing our example, we see that AT&T has authorized

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
shares of 14 billion shares.

83
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,420
This is the number of shares that shareholders

84
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:49,750
have given permission for AT&T to sell or issue.

85
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,890
Not all of these will be issued.

86
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,560
We've seen that AT&T has sold or issued

87
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,550
about 7.6 billion shares.

88
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,550
Thus the issued shares are always going to be less than

89
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,180
or equal to authorized shares.

90
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,040
And they're usually going to be shares that

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,750
are authorized, but not issued.

92
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,120
So in this case, AT&T has about 6.4 billion shares,

93
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,780
which is the difference between their 14 billion shares

94
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,480
authorized and their 7.6 billion shares issued.

95
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,650
And these extra 6.4 billion shares, AT&T

96
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:35,380
can issue in secondary offerings or in acquisitions like this

97
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,710
without much oversight by shareholders.

98
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,890
Finally, what we're going to be most interested in

99
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,380
are outstanding shares.

100
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,280
Outstanding shares are the shares that can actually vote.

101
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,200
Outstanding shares are also what we're

102
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,510
going to use to compute the market value of equity,

103
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,430
which is shares outstanding times the current share price.

104
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,350
Outstanding shares are the number

105
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,190
of shares that are actually owned by stockholders,

106
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,440
and to get to those, we're going to take

107
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,910
our issued shares of 7.6 billion and then subtract off

108
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,640
the number of shares held in Treasury.

109
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,740
So AT&T has got about 7.2 billion shares outstanding,

110
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,310
which is, again, the 7.6 billion shares that

111
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,550
are issued minus the 0.4 billion shares that are in Treasury.

112
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,140
So finally, notice that shares outstanding or outstanding

113
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,510
shares is always going to be less than

114
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,200
or equal to issued shares, is always going to be less than

115
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,350
or equal to authorized shares.

116
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,650
And what you can see here, going back for a second,

117
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,360
you can collect a lot of important information

118
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,180
relative to corporate governance just off

119
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,440
of the face of the balance sheet like this.

120
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,135
