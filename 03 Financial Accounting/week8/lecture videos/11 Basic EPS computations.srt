00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
PROFESSOR: Now, in terms of computations,

1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,460
we're going to first work through the basic computation,

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,310
which is basic and a little easier.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,430
And then we'll do some wrinkles and talk

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,790
about the diluted computation.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,210
So basic EPS, again, is net income

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,360
available to common shareholders divided

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,340
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,810
And here net income available to common shareholders

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,630
is equal to net income minus any income that goes

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,230
to non-controlling interest.

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,090
Remember, non-controlling interest

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,990
are a case if we bought part of a subsidiary,

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,850
but not all of it.

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,790
The part of it that we don't own is

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,050
the non-controlling interest, and it

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,770
gets a share of our net income.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,940
So we're going to subtract that off.

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,700
We're also going to subtract off any preferred dividends.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,750
So preferred dividends go to preferred shareholders.

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,410
What we're interested in is net income to common shareholders.

21
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,850
In terms of computing shares outstanding,

22
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,710
we're just going to do an example here.

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,750
So we start off with 180,000 shares outstanding.

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,070
We repurchase 30,000 shares.

25
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,270
That leaves us with 150,000 shares outstanding.

26
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,230
Then we do a 3 for 1 split, which causes

27
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,770
the shares to go up to 450,000.

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:33,380
Then we issue 50,000 more shares, and that gives us an ending balance

29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,150
of 500,000 shares.

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,600
So as we talked about with splits,

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,660
the first thing we want to do is to put

32
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,600
the shares outstanding on an apples-to-apples basis.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,830
And we want to do is go back and adjust

34
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,770
shares outstanding before the split to reflect the split.

35
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,950
So the split was a 3 for 1 split.

36
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,630
So on January 1, we had 180,000 shares outstanding.

37
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,040
We'll split adjust just that.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,410
That's 540,000.

39
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,750
We repurchased 30,000 shares.

40
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,740
Split adjusted, that's 90,000 shares.

41
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,010
And then we got our stock split, and then we

42
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,810
got our ending balance.

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,000
Now, we're going to compute a weighted average.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,180
So we've got our adjusted shares outstanding

45
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,140
in the second column.

46
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,650


47
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:39,850
Notice that the 540,000 shares from January 1 to March 31

48
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:45,010
were outstanding for 3/12 of a year and then so on down.

49
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,510
So we're going to weight the shares

50
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,930
by the fraction of the year that they were outstanding.

51
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,080
That gives us the numbers in the far right column.

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,780
And then we just add up those additional weighted shares

53
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,640
to come up with.

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,880
On average during the year for this company,

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,160
there was about 489,000 shares outstanding.

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,690
And then we have to now compute net income

57
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,410
available to common shareholders.

58
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,100
Let's pretend the net income was a million two,

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,520
but we had $200,000 in preferred dividends.

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,510
So that gives us our net income available

61
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,865
to common shareholders of a million dollars.

62
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:33,240
We got our weighted average shares

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,800
that we calculated a moment ago.

64
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,500
So take net income available at common of a million,

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,220
divide by 489,000, and that gives us

66
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,170
our basic EPS of $2.04.

67
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,000
