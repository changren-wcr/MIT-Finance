00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
PROFESSOR: So now we're going to talk about accounting

1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,130
for stock issuance.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,310
So we've issued some shares.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,770
It might be in a company's IPO, which

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,440
is the first time they issue shares, the Initial Public

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,239
Offering, or it might be they've done a secondary offering.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,160
So the accounting for this is-- again,

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,970
we're going to keep track first the par value

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,930
and then additional paid in capital that's received

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,250
in excess of par value.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,610
And we're-- account for those two things separately.

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,820
So let's just start off with a simple example.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,150
Suppose that we sell 4 million shares, we get $68 million

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,350
in cash, and let's pretend this is a company that

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,670
doesn't have any par value.

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,450
So the balance sheet equation for this is--

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,230
keep track of cash.

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,840
So we raise $68 million.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,720
And that $68 million goes into common stock,

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,480
or you could also call that additional paid in capital.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,590
So there's no par value here.

21
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,900
Now let's change the transaction just slightly.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,730
And let's pretend that the shares had

23
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,990
a par value of 1/1000 of $1--

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,900
so 0.001.

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,160
So what would the par value of 4 million shares

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,590
be if they had a par value of 1/1000 of $1?

27
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:35,320
So 4 million shares divided by $1,000 is $4,000.

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,960
So the way this transaction would change--

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,040
cash will be the same.

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,190
Now we're going to have $4,000 worth of par value.

31
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,950
And now our additional paid in capital

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,630
is not going to be $68 million.

33
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,360
It's going to be $68 million minus $4,000 in this example.

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,870
So that's accounting for stock issuance.

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,570
Let's look at how a real company does this.

36
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:12,240
Tesla, in March of 2017, sold 1.536 million shares of stock.

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,360
It got a price of $262 a share.

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,610
So this was a secondary offering.

39
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,630
So Tesla came public in 2010.

40
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,600
And it's doing another secondary offering here

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,190
to raise some additional money.

42
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,440
So it raised gross proceeds.

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,790
So gross proceeds-- there's just 1.536 million shares times $262

44
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,870
a share--

45
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,480
gives you $403 million.

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,460
And Tesla has a par value of 1/1000 of $1 per share.

47
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,480
So the way that Tesla would account for this transaction

48
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,040
then is cash went up.

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,670
We got $403 million worth of cash.

50
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,010
How much par value was there--

51
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,380
plus $1.536 million divided by 1,000--

52
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,300
is $1,536.

53
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,540
And then additional paid in capital-- it's basically

54
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:19,700
$403 million minus $1,500, which still gets you to about $403

55
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,040
million when you round it.

56
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,160
And we'll see this transaction as a reminder in Tesla's cash

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
flow statement.

58
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,200
So Tesla-- 2017 cash flow statement--

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,080
their cash flow from financing shows

60
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,490
that they raised $400 million in this common stock offer.

61
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,670
Now, notice there's a difference between the $403 million

62
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:52,030
we calculated above and the $400 million in cash

63
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,320
that Tesla said--

64
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,460
it raised a difference of $3 million.

65
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,820
And what this generally is is investment banking fees.

66
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,160
So remember, investment banks perform

67
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,110
a service for companies.

68
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,990
They help them raise capital.

69
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,770
And the investment banks, in this case, were paid $3 million

70
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,820
for this service.

71
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,038
So instead of raising $403 million,

72
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:22,670
Tesla only raised $400 million.

73
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,480
So that's because the underwriting fees

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,175
or the investment banking fees.

75
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:29,960


76
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,070
Now, the stock issuance cost us $3 million

77
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,380
in investment banking fees.

78
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,660
There's basically two ways to account for them.

79
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,690
I'm going to show you both of them briefly.

80
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,220
The first one is to capitalize the issuance costs.

81
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,140
So that means we get $400 million in cash.

82
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,380
We're going to put an asset on our balance sheet

83
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,110
equal to the investment banking fees.

84
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,897
Then we got the common stock at par.

85
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,730
And then we're going to have additional paid

86
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,850
in capital of $403 million.

87
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,370
Now, this is puzzling and a little bad

88
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,700
because you've got an asset, which is your investment

89
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,410
banking fees.

90
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,900
But remember, the intuition of this

91
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,620
is the investment bankers have helped you.

92
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,200
They've created an asset by giving you

93
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,570
access to the capital markets.

94
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,240
And then we're going to reflect that-- the value of that

95
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,310
help on our balance sheet for $3 million.

96
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,132
So some companies will do this.

97
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:35,970
But what most companies do is what Tesla do--

98
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,190
does-- is just knock the investment banking fees out

99
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,390
of additional paid in capital.

100
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,990
So in that case, the balance sheet entry--

101
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,350
we're still getting $400 million in cash.

102
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,770
Common stock is still $1,536.

103
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,570
In this case, we're going to reduce

104
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,400
the additional paid in capital.

105
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,480
It's not going to be $403 million.

106
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,980
We're going to sense-- immediately expensing

107
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,990
the investment banking fees.

108
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,765
And we just got an additional paid

109
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:09,450
in capital of $400 million.

110
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,220
So probably most companies choose option 2,

111
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,990
although you will see occasionally

112
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,940
companies doing option 1.

113
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,740
We're going to look at an excerpt

114
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,280
from Tesla's 2017 statement of stockholders' equity.

115
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,580
In this excerpt, they describe their sale

116
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,910
of stock for $262 a share.

117
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:40,330
As a review, recall that they sold 1.536 million shares

118
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,536
for gross proceeds of about $403 million.

119
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:52,641
This excerpt shows that issuance costs were $2.854 million,

120
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:56,565
or about $3 million.

121
00:06:56,565 --> 00:07:00,570
Subtracting these issuance costs gives net proceeds

122
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,432
of about $400 million.

123
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:07,200
Note that additional paid in capital in this case

124
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:16,800
is net proceeds of $400 million minus the par value of $1,536,

125
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,684
or approximately $400 million.

126
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:24,760
Since additional paid in capital and net proceeds

127
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,650
are about the same, we know that Tesla expensed the $3 million

128
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,810
in issuance costs.

129
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,160
If Tesla had capitalized these issuance costs,

130
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,130
additional paid in capital would be $403 million.
