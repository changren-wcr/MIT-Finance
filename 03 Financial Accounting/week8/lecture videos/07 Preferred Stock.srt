1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,490
PROFESSOR: So now just briefly, I

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,990
want to talk to you about the other part of stockholder's

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,510
equity.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,730
So we've got common stock, and we also have preferred stocks.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,630
The preferred stock is a term for a class of stock.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,490
There's lots of different flavors of preferred stock.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,610
Preferred stock-- the word preferred

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:27,560
means that preferred stock gets liquidation preference

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,820
over common stock in bankruptcy.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,090
So again, as we talked about before,

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,580
if a company liquidates, it's going

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,130
to sell off all its assets.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,220
It's going to pay off its liabilities.

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,910
It's going to then pay off its preferred stock if it has any.

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,730
And only then does common stock get any kind

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,790
of payoff in bankruptcy.

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,850
So preferred stock often looks kind of like debt

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,440
because it has different rights and preferences

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,480
to common stock.

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,500
These preferences, or what the preferred features are,

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,080
may include a dividend.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,520
So preferred stocks typically have a dividend.

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,840
So that makes it like debt.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,220
So if it's $100 preferred, it might have a $5 dividend,

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,900
so a 5% dividend.

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,910
And those dividends are specified

27
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,610
when the stock is issued.

28
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,260
And typically, your right to that dividend--

29
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,270
because your preferred security, you

30
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,690
get your dividend before the common stock gets any dividend.

31
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,480
Dividends may be cumulative.

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,730
What that means if for some reason

33
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,080
the company doesn't pay a preferred dividend one year,

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,650
the next year it has to pay that past preferred dividend

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,380
any other preferred dividends before common stockholders

36
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,570
can get dividends.

37
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,150
And then while we're talking about this in particular right

38
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,750
now, is preferred stock is often convertible,

39
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,110
which means that you can turn your preferred stock

40
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,530
into common stock at some exchange rate.

41
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,320


42
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,620
And in particular, those of you that

43
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,540
are interested in IPO companies, venture capitalists often

44
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,310
use convertible preferred stock as their funding vehicles

45
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,810
before the IPO.

46
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,520
So venture capital will give money to an pre-IPO company,

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,240
but it will give it in the form of a convertible preferred.

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,770
And the reason the venture capital

49
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,670
likes to do that is because it can force the company

50
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,170
to pay it a dividend.

51
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,280
You can't really pay a dividend on common stock pre-IPO.

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,370
And then having gotten all the dividends, when

53
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,120
the company, if it comes public and does an IPO,

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,760
then the venture capitalists at that point

55
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,280
turn their convertible preferred stock

56
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,090
into regular common stock.

57
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,040
So this is a very frequent funding vehicle

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,530
for pre-IPO companies used by venture capitalists.
