1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,790
PROFESSOR: So now we're going to talk about earnings

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,530
per share or EPS.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,340
So just briefly, as motivation, obviously investors

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,320
care about price per share.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,350
So they're going to also care about earnings per share.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:24,410
As an economic rationale, the price to EPS ratio,

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,520
which you'll see in the press talked a lot about as a PE

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,600
ratio, is a shorthand valuation metric.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,090
So how big is the stock price relative to earnings per share.

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,910
And if you remember our discussions in Shrek 2,

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,090
this can be motivated, as well, by discounted cash flow

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,720
analysis.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,960
So if earnings are constant and cash flows are constant,

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,970
it makes sense that the price is going

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,610
to be a constant multiple of cash flow

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,330
and therefore, earnings.

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,129
So we'll just take as a given the fact that investors

18
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,330
are really interested in the price earnings ratio

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,540
and therefore, in earnings per share.

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,050
So there's two flavors of earnings per share.

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,870
There's basic earnings per share,

22
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,640
which is net income available to common shareholders--

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,370
we'll define that term in just a second--

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,540
divided by average shares, outstanding.

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,850
The second, more complicated measure

26
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,350
is diluted earnings per share, which

27
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,910
we're going to adjust the numerator for any interest

28
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:47,370
expense on converts or any preferred dividends.

29
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,720
And then we're going to adjust the denominator for options

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,050
outstanding and convertible debt and preferred outstanding.

31
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,520
So this gets at the intuition, which

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,380
is earnings are not only for common stockholders,

33
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,330
but they're are also part of earnings go to option holders.

34
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,740
Part of earnings also go to convertible.

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,030
So diluted earnings per share is sort

36
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,580
of getting at the sharing of earnings between stock options

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,570
and convertibles.

38
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,420
And as we'll see in a second, diluted earnings per share

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,020
will be the same as basic earnings per share

40
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,610
if the calculation results in diluted earnings per share

41
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,350
being bigger than basic earnings per share.

42
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,810
And the reason that this happens often

43
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,590
is if you have negative income.

44
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,290
Diluted shares are going to be bigger than basic shares.

45
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,830
So if you compute diluted EPS for a firm

46
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,200
with negative income, it would be bigger than basic EPS.

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,590
But it's been decided that it's always

48
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,210
going to be the case that if basic EPS is smaller

49
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,400
than diluted EPS, then we're going

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,015
to set diluted EPS equal to basic EPS.

51
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:15,630


52
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,650
And both of them appear at the bottom of the income statement,

53
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,320
as we'll see in this example from Twitter.

54
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,600
So this is Twitter's 2018 income statement.

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:35,460
You see they've got net income in 2018 of about 1.2 billion,

56
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,200
they've got basic earnings per share of $1.60.

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,780
And they got diluted earnings per share of $1.56.

58
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,570
Then if you look in 2017--

59
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,810
and the same thing goes on in 2016--

60
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,720
those years, Twitter had a loss.

61
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,060
So basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share

62
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,600
are going to be the same thing.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,670
So diluted earnings per share will be reported as the same

64
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,480
as basic earnings per share.
