PROFESSOR: Question four deals with stock compensation.

1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,970
Companies will often compensate employees

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,080
by granting them stock options.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,630
These options may have a vesting period meaning that they cannot

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,360
be exercised until they vest.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,060
Use the BSE to record the transaction

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,350
to grant employees 15,000 stock options on January 1st.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,840
These options are valued at $20 each and will vest immediately.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,510
For stock options BSE will be reported

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,640
once stock options are vested.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,210
In this case since options are vested immediately,

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,210
contributed capital increases by 300,000

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,030
which is 20 times $15,000.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,420
Since stock options are a form of employee wages,

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,840
retained earnings decreased by 300,000

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,880
and is labeled as wage expense.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,620
Now, use the BSE to record the transaction assuming

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,470
those same options vest over three years evenly.

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,980
Again, BSE occurs once the options are vested.

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,080
Options are vested over a three year period

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,400
so contributed capital increases by 100,000

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,420
and retained earnings decrease by the same amount for three

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,970
years.
