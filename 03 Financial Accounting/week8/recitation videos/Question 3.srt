PROFESSOR: Question 3, part A, Preferred Stock--

1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,370
"Use the BSE to record the issuance

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,450
of 10,000 shares of 6% preferred stock with a par value

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,570
of $100 for $150 a share."

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,810
10,000 preferred stock was issued at $150 per share.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,210
So 150 times 10,000 equals 1.5 million.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,150
Cash increases by 1.5 million.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,420
Par value preferred stock increases by 1 million

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,140
because its par value per share is $100.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,330
Additional paid in capital is the difference

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,480
between total cash proceeds and par value

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,395
preferred stock, which is $0.5 million.

12
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:44,340
Next question-- "Use the BSE to record the first payment

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,050
of dividends."

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,870
6% preferred stock means the preferred stock

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,980
will pay 6% of its par value.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,500
Therefore, the dividend amount for 10,000 shares

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,670
should be $60,000.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,450
If dividends are declared but is yet to be paid,

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,240
dividends payable, which is a liability account,

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,450
increases by $60,000, and retained earnings

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,940
decreases by the same amount.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,640
If dividend is already paid in cash,

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,990
cash decreases by $60,000, and dividends

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,570
payable decreases by the same amount

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,240
and balances the equation out.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,160
Part B, Convertible Debt--

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,980
"Assume Uber issues 1,000 one-year 2% convertible bonds

28
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,260
with a face value of $100."

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,330
these bonds have a conversion feature

30
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,600
that allows the bondholders to convert each bond

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,780
to one Uber share at maturity.

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,330
The market rate at issuance is 8%,

33
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:48,120
and the present value of the bonds is $94,444.

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,370
Use the BSE to record the issuance.

35
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,970
Convertible bonds are treated similarly as a regular bond

36
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,350
without conversion.

37
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,670
The present value of the bond is $94,444,

38
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,130
so cash increases by that amount.

39
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,310
Bond payable increases by $100,000

40
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,960
since 1,000 bonds with a $100 face value each were issued.

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,570
To balance the equation out, bond discount,

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,020
which is a contraliability account, increases by 5,556.

43
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,720
Use the BSE to require the coupon payment

44
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,300
at the end of year one.

45
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,830
Since it's a 2% bond, cash decreases by $2,000.

46
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,410
Interest expense is $94,444 times 8% which is the market

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,250
rate, and this is 7,556.

48
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:46,520
Bond discount decreases by 5,556 to balance the equation now.

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,190
Suppose that at maturity, the stock

50
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,560
is trading at $80 a share.

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,960
Assume no par value.

52
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,060
The stock is trading lower than the bond's face value,

53
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,110
so the bondholders will not convert.

54
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,210
The bond principal is paid back.

55
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,540
Cash decreases by $100,000, and bond payable

56
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,210
decreases by the corresponding amount.

57
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,170
Suppose that at maturity, the stock is trading at $200

58
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,930
a share.

59
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,170
Assume bondholders convert.

60
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,520
The bondholders convert, so bond payable decreases by $100,000.

61
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,730
And because par value is assumed to be 0,

62
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,940
additional paid-in capital increases by the same 100,000.
