00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,900
PROFESSOR: Question 2, diluted EPS conversions, Part A,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,450
net effect of number of shares.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,380
Suppose Kendall Corp. is trading at $50 per share.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,860
Outstanding stock options include 200,000 options

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,460
with an exercise price of $30 a share

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,280
and 100,000 options with an exercise

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,290
price of $60 per share.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,020
To assess the net effect of number of shares,

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,670
we conduct three steps.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:33,040
Step one, assume exercise all in-the-money options.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,740
There are 200,000 options with an exercise

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,540
price of $30 per share.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,320
So the proceeds are $6 million.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,870
We ignore $60 per share options, because those options are not

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,430
in-the-money.

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,540
Step two, assume use of proceeds to repurchase stock.

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,830
With the $6 million proceeds, we can purchase 120,000 shares,

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,160
since the current share price is $50 per share.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,610
Step three, examine the net effect on shares outstanding.

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,430
In step one, 200,000 shares increased.

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,940
And in step two, 120,000 shares decreased.

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,940
Therefore, net, the weighted average shares outstanding

23
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,700
increases by 80,000 shares.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,700
Part B, calculating diluted EPS.

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,120
Kendall Corp. maintained 500,000 shares outstanding

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,290
for the whole year.

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,850
Its net income was $2 million and did not have any addbacks.

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,360
What is the diluted EPS for Kendall Corp.?

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,270
Recall the diluted EPS formula, net income

30
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,270
available to common shareholders plus addbacks,

31
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,250
divided by weighted average shares

32
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,440
outstanding plus conversions.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,945
Here, net income is $2 million.

34
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:48,940
There's no addbacks.

35
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,100
And divide this by 500,000 shares plus 80,000.

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:00,060
And this equals diluted EPS of $3.45 per share.
