00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,470
PROFESSOR: Let's talk about earnings per share.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,220
Earnings per share is a commonly used metric

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,590
for assessing profitability.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,230
It is typically calculated in two ways-- basic and diluted.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,110
Let's first look at the basic EPS.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,650
Basic EPS is calculated as net income

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,440
available to common shareholders divided

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,500
by weighted average shares outstanding.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,470
Specifically, the numerator here is net income

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,220
minus net income attributable to non-controlling interest

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,690
minus preferred dividends.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,660
For the denominator, let's look at an example.

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,950
The following table shows the number of shares on each date

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,850
and how long a firm maintain that number of shares.

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,920
For example, on January 1st, there

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,280
were 100,000 shares outstanding for three months

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,110
under column weight.

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,060
In April, the number of shares increased to 120,000 shares

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,160
for a month and so on.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,550
Therefore, the weighted average of the number

21
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:10,960
of shares throughout the year in this example is 107,500 shares.

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,550
Diluted EPS goes one step further to calculate the EPS.

23
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,270
It represents the EPS under a what-if scenario

24
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,960
in which all in-the-money stock options are exercised

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,880
and all convertible instruments are converted to common stock.

26
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,060
The formula for diluted EPS is net income

27
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,240
available to common shareholders plus add-backs

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,100
divided by weighted average shares

29
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,780
outstanding plus conversions.

30
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,055
There are two additional items added from the basic EPS--

31
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:44,630
add-backs and conversions.

32
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,490
Add-backs in the numerator include

33
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,670
dividends paid to preferred shareholders and interest paid

34
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,190
to convertible debt holders.

35
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,640
Conversions include convertible instruments and stock option

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,690
exercises.

37
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,790
Assume all convertible instruments

38
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,190
converted into common stock.

39
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,500
Stock option exercises require more calculations.
