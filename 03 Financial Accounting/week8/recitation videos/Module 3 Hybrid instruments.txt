PROFESSOR: In this section, we'll
cover two types of hybrid instruments.
First, preferred stock is similar to a bond,
but pays dividends like equity.
It generally does not come with ownership or voting rights
and pays a stated dividend.
Second, there is convertible debt.

via the conversion option.

convertible debt tends to have very low interest payments.
We will solve two examples regarding
these hybrid instrument accounting.
