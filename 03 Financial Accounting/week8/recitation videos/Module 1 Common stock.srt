00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,520
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,750
Welcome to the eighth recitation of the Financial Accounting

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,630
course.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,720
In this recitation, we'll cover shareholders' equity.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,020
Specifically, we'll cover a common stock and Treasury

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,840
stock, hybrid instruments, calculating

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,530
earnings per share for both basic and diluted, and stock

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,060
compensation.

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,050
Before getting into shareholders' equity,

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,560
Let's discuss a little bit about equity financing

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,470
in order for companies to grow and be profitable,

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,830
they need to take on projects or make investments.

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,200
Companies can only take on these projects

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,300
if they have cash or capital.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,630
Typically, cash generated from day-to-day operations alone

16
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,750
cannot generate enough cash to take on large projects.

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,040
So what can companies do if they need more cash?

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,290
They can either borrow money through a loan

19
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,830
or issuing bonds, which we covered in last class,

20
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,010
or issue stock, which is equity.

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,930
When a company issues common stock,

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,600
they give the investors access to two types

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,960
of rights, ownership rights and voting rights.

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,210
Holding common stock ensures that you

25
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,460
have a piece of the company, meaning

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,650
you're entitled to some proportion of profits

27
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,110
according to your stock holdings.

28
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,880
For example, if an investor holds

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,700
10% of the common stock of a firm,

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,100
the investor is entitled to 10% of the earnings.

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,450
Similarly, holding stocks entitles you to voting rights.

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,640
In this example, the investor has

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,170
10% of the voting rights of a company.

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,570
A single investor holding 51% of the company,

35
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,350
therefore, can make most, if not all,

36
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,520
of the company's major decisions due to the majority ownership

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,570
the investor has.

38
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,240
To account for common stock, common stock

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,920
is recorded in two separate accounts

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,600
on the balance sheet, par value and additional paid-in capital.

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,020
Par value represents the amount of equity using the par,

42
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,780
or the face, value of each shares.

43
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,590
For example, if a firm issues 100 shares and its shares

44
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,290
are $1 per share at the face value,

45
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,770
then you would record $100 of par value equity

46
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,150
on the balance sheet.

47
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,310
The additional paid-in capital represents

48
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,500
the additional capital received on top

49
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,820
of the $100, which is $900.
