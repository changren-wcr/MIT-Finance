00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,710
PROFESSOR: In this section, we'll

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,620
cover two types of hybrid instruments.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,340
First, preferred stock is similar to a bond,

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,770
but pays dividends like equity.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,950
It generally does not come with ownership or voting rights

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,600
and pays a stated dividend.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,110
Second, there is convertible debt.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,690
Convertible debt is interest-bearing debt

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,200
that has the ability to be converted to stock.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,030
Convertible debt allows the owner

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,970
to take advantage of increases in the stock price

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,340
via the conversion option.

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,770
Because of the value of this option,

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,790
convertible debt tends to have very low interest payments.

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,330
We will solve two examples regarding

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,160
these hybrid instrument accounting.
