00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,990
PROFESSOR: Question 1-- common stock, part A, issuance.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,000
Use the balance sheet equation to record

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,610
the issuance of 1 million shares of common stock

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,920
for $45 per share and assume no par value.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,900
Sits par value is 0, we record 45 times 1 million shares,

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,480
$45 million of increase in cash, and $45 million increase

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,360
of additional paid in capital.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,670
Use the BSE to record the issuance

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,270
of $1 million shares of $1 par value common stock,

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,080
or $45 per share.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,040
In this case, the par value of each common stock is $1,

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,710
and the firm issued 1 million shares.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,100
Cash increases by $45 million, as before.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,820
But on the equity side, par value common stock increases

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,810
by 1 million and the remaining $44 million increase

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,720
at additional paid in capital.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,480
Part B-- let's solve an example regarding issuance.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,570
Expenses.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,129
Now suppose ABC Company works with an investment bank

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,410
who underwrites the deal.

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,370
ABC Company issues 1 million shares of $1 par common stock

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,820
for $50 a share, but incurs $3 million

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,980
of underwriting expenses.

24
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,860
Use the BSE, assuming ABC Company

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,270
capitalizes issuance costs.

26
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,100
Regardless of capitalizing or not

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,610
capitalizing issuance costs, the actual cash proceeds

28
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,530
received from issuing equity is $47 million.

29
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,230
So cash increases by $47 million,

30
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,980
and capitalized issuance costs, which is an asset item,

31
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,700
increases by $3 million, the underwriting expense.

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,270
The equity side remains similar to the previous question.

33
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,240
Par value of common stock increases by 1 million,

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,440
and additional paid-in capital increases by $49 million.

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,450
This time use the BSE, assuming ABC Company reduces APIC

36
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,030
by issuance costs.

37
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,760
Again, cash increases by $47 million.

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,160
On the equity side, however, common stock

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,010
increases by 1 million, in additional paid

40
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,350
in capital increases by $46 million,

41
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,100
because issuance costs are not capitalized.

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,720
Part C were purchases.

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,880
When a company repurchases stock,

44
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,370
it is said to be held in treasury

45
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,980
and goes into the Treasury stock account.

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,260
This is a contra equity account.

47
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,080
Keeping this in mind, suppose management

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,410
at ABC Company repurchases 100,000 shares

49
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,570
at $30 per share.

50
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,070
Use the BSE to record this transaction.

51
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,190
ABC Company used up three million of cash

52
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,650
to repurchase its stocks.

53
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,320
Cash decreases by $3 million and Treasury stock account,

54
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,790
which is a contra equity account increases by $3 million.

55
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,610
Now use the BSE to record the transaction

56
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,320
to reissue 30,000 shares held in treasury at $40 a share.

57
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,070
Cash increased by $1.2 million, because the company issued

58
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,220
30,000 shares at $40 per share.

59
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,580
Since the firm reissued the stocks held in treasury,

60
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,550
treasury stock decreases by $5.9 million

61
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,360
because it repurchased its shares at $30 per share

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,430
in the previous question.

63
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,500
To balance the equation out, additional

64
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,370
paid-in capital increases by $300,000.

65
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,960
Part D-- stocks splits.

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,170
Occasionally, a company will engage in a stock split.

67
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,670
This affects the number of shares outstanding

68
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,560
and the stock price.

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,640
But typically, it does not affect the account balances.

70
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,330
Suppose ABC Company has 1 million shares outstanding,

71
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,620
trading at $45 a share, and engages in a 3 to 1

72
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,850
stock split.

73
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,300
How many shares outstanding after the split?

74
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,420
It is a 3 to 1 stock split, meaning

75
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,690
total shares outstanding increases by 3 times.

76
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,220
So 3 million that are outstanding after the split.

77
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,220
What is the share price immediately

78
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,690
following the split?

79
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,320
Again, this is pretty simple.

80
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,860
The price per share decreases by 1/3.

81
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,279
So the share price drops to 1/3 of the original share price.

82
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,899
The answer is $15.

83
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,770
What is the BSE entry to record this Transaction only

84
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,630
the number of shares outstanding shares changed,

85
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,150
so there isn't any effect on the balance sheet.
