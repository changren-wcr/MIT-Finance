1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,800
PROFESSOR: So recently, starting in 2020,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,450
and this has somewhat been delayed

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,450
because of the pandemic, it was all banks were supposed

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,070
to adopt this in 2020, but because of the pandemic,

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,070
they're allowed to sort of average it

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,850
in over the next four years.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,820
So here's our incurred loss model,

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,440
as we talked about, where you only reserve if it's probable

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,090
that a loan is impaired.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,689
Probable, again, means greater than 50%.

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,985
We're going to replace this.

12
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:39,470
This was a project that the US standard-setters

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,690
and the international standard-setters agreed on.

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,230
So they came up with this expected loss model,

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,480
and now you have to record a loss when

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,900
it's expected, even if there's, like,

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,000
a tiny chance of there being a loss, say, like, a 5% chance.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,750
So this is obviously going to result in a much more

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,110
immediate loss accrual.

20
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,090
And this new standard is referred

21
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,470
to as CECL, which is Current Expected Credit Losses,

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,260
or CECL is the acronym.

23
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,440
And it's, as compared to the old standard, which

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,720
was kind of backward-looking, this

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,837
is forward-looking in the sense that when we make a loan,

26
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,420
we're going to look off in the future.

27
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,570
We're going to think, can we make a loss on this loan?

28
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,330
And if we can, we're going to reserve for it.

29
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,310
So the next several slides, I'm going to just show you

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,180
the differences in accounting at a big-picture level

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,080
between the old standard, which is the incurred loss standard,

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,750
and the new standard, which is CECL.

33
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,820
So we come back to our friends at Z Bank here,

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,350
and we're going to imagine that Z Bank issues 100 loans,

35
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,710
and each loan is for $1,000.

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,520
And the loans have an interest rate of 20%,

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,770
and they mature in one year.

38
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,910
So what I'm trying to do is give you

39
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,830
the flavor of credit card debt.

40
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,680
So if you have a credit card, if you ever

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,020
do not pay your credit card, the interest rate on that balance

42
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,390
is huge, right?

43
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,400
So it's not exactly 20% nowadays.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,590
It's probably 15% nowadays, but it's a huge rate, though.

45
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,730
OK?

46
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,040
So based on its experience of making

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,180
these credit card-type loans, Z Bank

48
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,890
expects these payoff scenarios.

49
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,100
So it's going to make 100 loans.

50
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,910
Expects 95 of them are going to be good,

51
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,890
and the good loan will pay interest at 20%,

52
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,160
so it'll pay $1,000 times 20%, or $200 in interest,

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,760
and it will repay the loan amount, which is $1,000.

54
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,985
The bad ones, on the other hand, they're

55
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,900
going to assume they pay no interest,

56
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,460
and they're going to pay none of the loan back.

57
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,450
And so another way of saying this is that at the time

58
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,400
it makes these loans, based on its past history

59
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,430
with these kind of customers, Z Bank

60
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,260
expects credit losses on 5% of the loans.

61
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,310
They expect 5% of them to be bad.

62
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,640
But it doesn't know which of those 100 customers

63
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,570
are going to be bad.

64
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,850
It just knows that there's going to be 5 bad loans out of 100,

65
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,080
on average.

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,930
So the old accounting, which is incurred loss accounting,

67
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,370
we make 100 loans for $1,000.

68
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,100
So we put out $100,000 worth of cash,

69
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,870
and the asset goes on our balance

70
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,500
sheet, $100,000 worth of loans.

71
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,150
Do we accrue a loss provision on January 1?

72
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,650
No.

73
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,960
At this point, we don't have any data

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,380
that a specific individual loan is going to go bad.

75
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,570
So there's no loan loss provision here.

76
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,220


77
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,240
At June 30, say, like, by this point, five of these loans

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,850
have had no payments made on them,

79
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,430
so they're unlikely to pay.

80
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,870
So we're going to create a reserve.

81
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,740
We're going to create an allowance for loan losses,

82
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,380
and we're going to create a $5,000 provision

83
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,720
for loan losses that will reduce our income.

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,980
Now, on June 30, we're going to record interest,

85
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,150
and we're just going to assume that we're getting interest

86
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:58,510
on the 95 loans that are still current at that point.

87
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,150
And six months of interest at 10%, so 95 times 10%

88
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,970
would be $9,500 of interest revenue.

89
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,550


90
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,610
And then at the end of the year, 95 of the loans

91
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,530
pay off in full.

92
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,080
Five of them don't pay us anything,

93
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,690
and we charge those off, and then

94
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,760
we get our other six months of interest.

95
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,930
So we got loans paid off in full we get $95,000 from.

96
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,990
We write off the $5,000 worth of bad loans, the five bad loans.

97
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,530
And then we get our other six months of interest.

98
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,870
So that's current incurred loss accounting.

99
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,170
Now, let's look at the same thing with CECL.

100
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,300
So the accounting at the start is the same.

101
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,150
Cash goes down $100,000.

102
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,880
Loans go up $100,000.

103
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,070
Do we accrue a loan loss provision on January 1?

104
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,940
Well, based on our experience, we know that 5% of these loans

105
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,800
are going to go bad.

106
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,670
So at the time we make the loan, we're

107
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:21,380
going to have a $5,000 provision for loan losses

108
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,290
and create an allowance for loan losses there.

109
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,350
Now, on June 30, we identify five loans

110
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,958
that are unlikely to pay.

111
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,250
Here, we're not going to do anything because we already

112
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,000
made this accrual.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,072


114
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,090
You're going to record interest.

115
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:50,340
So there's 95 good loans at 20%, times a half a year is $9,500.

116
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,780
And then again, 95 of the loans pay in full.

117
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,780


118
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,900
Five don't pay and charge off.

119
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,450
And then we record the remaining amounts of interest.

120
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,870
So notice the only difference in this accounting

121
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,880
here is that the loan loss provision happens immediately

122
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,460
rather than we waited at six months

123
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,990
in this stylized example.

124
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,750
One other thing I want to point out to you

125
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,670
here is notice that we're getting

126
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,580
$19,000 worth of interest.

127
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,750
We're getting back $95,000 worth of principle.

128
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,030
So total cash repayments are $114,000.

129
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,370
We put out $100,000 worth of cash.

130
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,190
So we're making 14%.

131
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,270
Even though there's a lot of bad debt here or bad loans here,

132
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,910
this is a very smart thing for banks

133
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,450
to do so that they make tremendous amounts of money

134
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,180
on these credit card-type loans.

135
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,100
This is why the banks hate CECL, which is

136
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,910
in the header of my next slide.

137
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,690
So even though we're going to make a lot of money

138
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:09,690
on these loans, when we issue these loans at the beginning,

139
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,570
we have an immediate loss, OK?

140
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,390
And that's that accrues loss provision,

141
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:22,030
so our income is negative on the day that we issue these loans.

142
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,990
It won't be until the loans sort of mature

143
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,720
and pay off that we'll sort of catch up

144
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,710
on this negative accrual.

145
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,556
So the banks really, really, really hate this provision.

146
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:39,240
It's kind of funny accounting, and when you think about it,

147
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,880
it comes from the matching principle in the sense

148
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,060
that we're accruing for loan losses immediately,

149
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,750
but we don't get to accrue for the high interest income

150
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,200
until we earn that interest income.

151
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,780
So there's sort of a failure of matching going on here.

152
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,500
But this is the new standard, and I

153
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,840
want you to at least have the outlines of it

154
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,990
because it's something that's going to be talked about

155
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,960
and really affect the banking industry going forward.

156
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,520


157
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,650
Here's JP Morgan's investor presentation

158
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,050
on this, back in 2019.

159
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,100
So JP Morgan is sort of looking forward to the effect there,

160
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,590
but JP Morgan is computing a 35% increase in their loan loss

161
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,050
allowances, so loan loss allowance

162
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:37,180
is a big contra asset that's going to increase by 35%.

163
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,010
That's going to reduce JP Morgan's income and JP Morgan's

164
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,700
capital so that this is a big deal.

165
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,270
And who gets hurt most by this are

166
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,320
people like JP Morgan that have big credit card

167
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,220
portfolios where there's a lot of loss experience.

168
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,210
So consumer loans, as this chart sort of talked about,

169
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,710
have high loss experience, but home loans

170
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,470
and other types of loans won't have so much high loss

171
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,450
experience.

172
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,890
So takeaways, remember, we talked

173
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,640
about loan loss provisions.

174
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,110
This is exactly like bad debt expenses,

175
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,740
so this would review--

176
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,100
this involves judgment and mixed incentives.

177
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,150
We also reviewed marketable securities accounting.

178
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,800
These are the only two things that

179
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,860
are going to be on the exam, is sort of the items

180
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,630
that we reviewed.

181
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,780
The rest of this, we talked about deposits.

182
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,220
We talked about how deposits created a demand for banks

183
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,540
to highly leverage themselves.

184
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,610
We talked about how regulators are there

185
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,950
to prevent banks from taking on too much leverage.

186
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,290
And what we talked about here is very

187
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,350
relevant to the crisis of 2008.

188
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,860
There have been lots of fixes that have been put in here,

189
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,520
but I imagine that if the banking industry runs

190
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,120
into difficulty because of the current pandemic,

191
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,700
these same issues are going to come back.

192
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,000
Are loan loss provisions adequate enough?

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,370
Are marketable securities being accounted for properly?
