1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,160
PROFESSOR: Here's the four largest US banks as of 2018,

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,650
so Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,716
So I notice they all have net income of about $25 billion.

4
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:22,560
Their assets are all roughly $2 trillion plus or minus.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:31,470
Their stockholders' equity are $200 billion plus or minus.

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,470
Their return on assets, which is net income divided

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,000
by ending assets, is about 1%, which is

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,850
a fairly low return on assets.

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,830
And then the return on equity, which

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,880
is net income divided by ending stockholders' equity,

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,150
is roughly about 10% or 12%, which

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,540
is a reasonably healthy return on equity.

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,980
Now, recall from our earlier discussions,

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,000
DuPont analysis, which is an analysis of the drivers

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,140
of the return on equity.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,670
So return on equity, which is net income divided

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,550
by ending stockholders' equity, can be decomposed into return

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,520
on assets, which is net income divided

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,600
by total assets multiplied by leverage,

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,470
which is total assets divided by stockholders' equity.

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,870
So there's two drivers there.

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,930
You could either have a high return on assets,

23
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,750
or you can take on a lot of leverage

24
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,870
if you want to have a high return on equity.

25
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,700
So looking at the four big US banks, the relation

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,220
between return on assets, bank leverage, and return on equity,

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,430
again, return on assets is fairly small.

28
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,690
It's about 1%.

29
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,650
But the way that these banks generate

30
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,520
a reasonably healthy return on equity is through leverage.

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,060
So they're all leveraged about 10 times.

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,490
So if you take a 1% return on assets, multiply that by 10,

33
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,920
you get sort of a 10% return on equity.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,140
So they're generating their return on equity

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,900
through leverage rather than through return on assets.

36
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,250
In the balance sheet equation for banks then,

37
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,980
we've sort of already illustrated

38
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,550
this with Wells Fargo.

39
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,750
It's typically we've got assets which

40
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,810
are mainly loans, also marketable securities

41
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,980
and other assets.

42
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,010
Our liabilities are predominantly

43
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,960
deposits and other liabilities, but our liabilities

44
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,040
are about 90% of assets, and our shareholders' equity

45
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,210
are only about 10% of assets, which means that banks

46
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,730
are very highly levered.

47
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,180
So why that is, we're going to discuss this

48
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,520
in the next couple of slides.

49
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,690
The counterfactual is so when you think about,

50
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,810
what would happen if a sort of risky industrial company

51
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,930
like an Amazon or a Tesla, if it wanted to lever itself up 90%?

52
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,680
So it would go out, it would repurchase stock, issue debt,

53
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,420
keep issuing debt and keep repurchasing stock

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,200
until it reaches 90% leverage ratio.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,390
Thing is here is the debt holders,

56
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,350
as you get more and more highly levered,

57
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,020
your debt is more and more risky,

58
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,550
and the debt holders would demand higher interest rates

59
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,660
on that higher risk debt, so they demand a risk premium.

60
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,190
So ultimately, the industrials, Tesla, in our example,

61
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,510
it could not actually get 90% leverage

62
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,810
because the interest rate on that incremental debt

63
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,030
would be too high.

64
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,680
So now we're going to talk about why

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,590
banks are so highly levered.

66
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,830
And to do this, we're going to give some intuition for bank

67
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,310
leverage and also give intuition for why

68
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,110
banks must be regulated.

69
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,970
So it's a fact that almost all countries

70
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,520
provide deposit insurance, OK?

71
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,830
So countries, in order to create wealth and protect people,

72
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,400
they give deposit insurance, and what deposit insurance means,

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,380
that at least in the US, if you take $250,000

74
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,060
and put it into a bank, the bank becomes insolvent,

75
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,860
which is another word for going bankrupt.

76
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,720
If the bank can't pay you your $250,000,

77
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,140
because the government insures those deposits,

78
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,370
the government will pay you your $250,000.

79
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,110
And when you think about this, what this means is

80
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,600
you don't really care about whether the bank is

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,120
risky or not, OK?

82
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,105
Because the government is the one that's insuring your debt.

83
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:11,580
So if the bank goes bankrupt, you're

84
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,810
going to get paid by the government.

85
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,700
So depositors see deposits as very low risk.

86
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,640
And because they think they're low risk,

87
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,380
they're not going to demand a risk premium.

88
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,940
So if you compare the rate on a five-year deposit

89
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,700
with a rate on a five-year corporate bond,

90
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,560
the rate on the five-year corporate bond

91
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,920
is going to be much higher because the corporate bond is

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,580
much riskier than a deposit, which is guaranteed

93
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,930
by the federal government.

94
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,330
So since deposits are low-cost, how

95
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,690
do banks want to finance themselves?

96
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,370
Well, remember, in economics, there's

97
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,460
this idea which is the free good is overconsumed.

98
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,630
So deposits are sort of like free financing or very low-cost

99
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,510
financing for banks, so banks want to get

100
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,860
as many deposits as possible.

101
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,420
They want to get as much leverage as possible.

102
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,070
And this means that they're taking

103
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,280
on a lot of financial risk because the more

104
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,480
leverage you have, the greater risk you bear.

105
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,610
So this, in turn, creates the need for bank regulation

106
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,020
because you can't have the banks willy-nilly sort of taking risk

107
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,100
with government deposits.

108
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,120
So the regulators have to be there to make sure

109
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,610
that the bankers are not taking on too much risk.

110
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,320


111
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,100
So how bank regulation works, then,

112
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,280
and this is broad intuition, there's obviously details

113
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,210
that we're going to skim over here,

114
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,480
but the big picture of bank regulation

115
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,000
is the regulators want to make sure

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,720
that the banks have enough capital, which is basically

117
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,860
stockholders' equity, so that if something goes bad,

118
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,750
there's enough stockholders' equity

119
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,620
there to absorb losses so the bank doesn't go

120
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,510
bankrupt or become insolvent.

121
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,630
The way that regulators think about capital,

122
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,310
it is basically shareholders' equity divided by assets.

123
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,200
And connecting to what we've been talking

124
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,580
about earlier in the course, notice that capital is just 1

125
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,020
over leverage, 1 divided by leverage,

126
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,820
so it's the inverse of leverage.

127
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,990
So if you got a lot of capital, you have low leverage.

128
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,650
If you have low capital, you have high leverage.

129
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,310
So the key issues here for regulation

130
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,980
is, how much capital should be required?

131
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,040
I'll go through some examples of this in a minute.

132
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,770
How are we going to define shareholders' equity?

133
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,040
Should we adjust shareholders' equity for things

134
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,510
like goodwill, which might not be valuable in bankruptcy

135
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,250
or insolvency?

136
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,990
And how should we adjust assets for things

137
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,350
that like goodwill that might not be valuable or insolvency?

138
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,290
Are our loan loss reserves adequate?

139
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,090
And we're going to talk about that in a couple of minutes.

140
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,360
So there's something in the US, and there's

141
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,130
something in other countries, but it's

142
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,200
called Regulatory Accounting Principles, or RAP, OK?

143
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,250
So regulatory accounting principles basically

144
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,120
take Generally Acceptable Accounting Principles, or GAAP,

145
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,880
and make adjustments so that they can be confident

146
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,621
that the capital number that they have

147
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:40,490
is a capital number that they can be confident of.

148
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,789
So we're not going to talk about RAP in particular here,

149
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,350
but the concept is is the regulators take US GAAP,

150
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,130
make adjustments to it using regulatory accounting

151
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,910
principles, or RAP.

152
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,340
So the big one is regulatory capital,

153
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,730
and I'm just going to call this adjusted GAAP

154
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,230
common stockholders' equity.

155
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,810


156
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,950
So in regulatory parlance in the US,

157
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,980
there's something called tier 1 capital,

158
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,710
and to compute tier 1 capital, you

159
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,350
take common stockholders' equity,

160
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,860
you subtract off some goodwill and intangibles,

161
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,380
and then you make some other adjustments to that.

162
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,850
So that's common equity adjusted to remove

163
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,030
goodwill and intangibles and making some other adjustments

164
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,850
as well.

165
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,870
And then our tier 1 leverage ratio

166
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,470
is going to be that tier 1 capital divided

167
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,240
by adjusted assets where we're also adjusting assets

168
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,720
with goodwill and intangibles and other things as well.

169
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,650
And in the US, the regulatory minimum for the tier 1 leverage

170
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,250
ratio is 4%.

171
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,180
So it's not exactly stockholder's equity to assets,

172
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,820
but stockholders' equity to assets

173
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,180
needs to be in the ballpark of 4%

174
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,880
based on this tier 1 leverage ratio.

175
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,180
The other big requirement is something called a tier

176
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,040
1 risk-based capital ratio.

177
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,000
So again, we're going to take our same tier 1 capital that we

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,330
computed at the top of the slide,

179
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,400
but instead of average assets, we're

180
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,880
going to use average risk-weighted assets.

181
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,850
And what risk-weighted assets are is

182
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,110
they're average assets where low-risk assets like government

183
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,200
bonds and some loans get a low weight,

184
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,540
and then high-risk assets like junk bonds and credit cards

185
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,850
get a high weight, OK?

186
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,080
So the minimum requirement for the risk-based capital ratio

187
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,830
is 10.5%.

188
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,980
And then JP Morgan's 2018 10-K gives a nice picture of this,

189
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,210
OK?

190
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,360
So it shows you how they take common stockholders' equity,

191
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,110
they take some deductions for goodwill,

192
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,810
they take some deductions for mortgage servicing

193
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,900
rights, which is a kind of intangible asset.

194
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,400
They're not going to allow deferred tax assets,

195
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,360
so that's another adjustment that

196
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,800
are associated with tax loss carryforwards,

197
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,460
and then they're going to add to this adjusted common equity

198
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,740
something called perpetual preferred stock.

199
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,700
So we've talked about preferred stock earlier.

200
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,790
A lot of preferred stock is like debt

201
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,750
in that it has a maturity date.

202
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,550
So you issue preferred stock, and it matures 20 years

203
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,930
from now.

204
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,840
Banks issue something called perpetual preferred stock,

205
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,480
which is much more like common equity.

206
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,560
So that preferred stock has no maturity date.

207
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,120
It stays outstanding forever unless it's repurchased,

208
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,030
and that's an additional capital buffer

209
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,640
that goes into JP Morgan's tier 1 capital.

210
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,270
So JP Morgan has a nice table in their 10-K in 2018.

211
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,360
It shows you their tier 1 capital

212
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,645
is a little over $200 billion.

213
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:27,880
Their adjusted average assets are about $2.6 trillion.

214
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,920
And if you take those two numbers

215
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,330
and divide them through each other,

216
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,350
that gives you JP Morgan's tier 1 leverage

217
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,430
ratio, which is 8.1%.

218
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,260
And then they've got a bunch of calculations

219
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,820
on risk-based capital.

220
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,120
One of them is a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio.

221
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,120
So we take our same tier 1 capital, which

222
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,030
is a little over $200 billion.

223
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,420
They do a computation of risk-based assets

224
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,800
so that risk-weighted assets for JP Morgan are $1.5 trillion.

225
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,340
So the risk-weighting is something

226
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,630
if you got something that's really risky that's got a risk

227
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,660
rating of 100%, but if you've got something

228
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,050
like cash that has essentially no risk, that

229
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,990
gets a risk rating of 0%.

230
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,640
So risk-weighted assets are going

231
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,500
to be smaller than average assets on the balance sheet.

232
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,860
Having computed those risk-weighted assets,

233
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,710
they take the ratio of tier 1 capital

234
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,460
to risk-weighted assets, and that gives them

235
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,360
their tier 1 capital ratio.
