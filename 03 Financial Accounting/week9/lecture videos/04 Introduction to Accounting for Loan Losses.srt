JOHN CORE: So the allowance for loan losses

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,490
is very similar to what we've talked

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,170
about earlier in the course, which

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,930
is the allowance for doubtful accounts.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,200
It comes about because of accrual accounting.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,000
It is subjective.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,940
It's a contra-asset account, and it

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,350
can have a large impact on a bank's financial statements.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,390
So as a review, given the similarity,

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,100
if a borrower defaults on a loan in a particular period,

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,150
will it affect the bank's income?

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,360
And as you recall, no, it won't, so long

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,990
as the allowance at the start of the period was adequate.

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,750
Will it affect the bank's balance sheet?

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,820
In this case, yes, it will.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,460
It's going to reduce loans outstanding.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,980
And it's going to reduce the allowance for long losses.

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,380
So here's the balance sheet equation.

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,670
So we got our asset, which is loans.

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,540
We got the contra-asset, which is allowance for loan losses.

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,350
And we got retained earnings.

22
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,250
If we estimate a $500,000 potential loss,

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,830
what do we record?

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,550
So $500,000 in allowance for loan losses, which

25
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,240
is the contra-asset, and $500,000 in

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,640
retained earnings, which is provisioned for loan losses.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,460
So this is exactly the same.

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,630
It's different words.

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,620
If we were talking about accounts receivable,

30
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,260
it would be the allowance for doubtful accounts

31
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,120
would be the contra-asset.

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,750
And instead of calling it provision for loan losses,

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,030
we would call it bad debt expense.

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,060
So the words are different, but the accounting

35
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,820
is almost identical.

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,700
So now what happens when we have to write off a loan?

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,570
So as we talked about above, we've

38
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,220
got sufficient allowance here.

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,710
We got a $500,000 in the allowance.

40
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,180
So when we have to write off this loan,

41
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,980
we're going to remove $20,000 from the asset, which is loans.

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,270
And then we're going to charge $20,000

43
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,860
to the contra-asset, which is allowance for loan losses.

44
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,550
But notice that this has no effect on our income

45
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,900
because we've provided for it adequately in the past.

46
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,610
So this is the same message from bad debt expense.

47
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,480
As long as you have a sufficient allowance for doubtful

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,320
accounts, when you have to write off a specific accounts

49
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,070
receivable, it's not going to affect your net income.

50
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,945
So this is review.

51
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:47,390


52
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,810
And also as a review, the way the banks come up

53
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,860
with their loan loss provision is basically aging analysis.

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,090
So this is a picture and some words from Wells Fargo's 2018

55
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,510
Annual Report, Note 6 of the financial statements.

56
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,340
And they say, "Many of our lost estimation techniques

57
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,160
used for the allowance for credit losses

58
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,150
rely on delinquency-based models."

59
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,910
And then the chart there in the middle of this slide

60
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,300
shows how they do that.

61
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,080
So they take different types of loans.

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,770
They take the real estate loans, credit cards, automobile,

63
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,270
et cetera.

64
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,510
And then they array them by Days Past Due.

65
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,290
So DPD in this chart is Days Passed Due.

66
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:45,260
So if it's 29 days past due or less, it's current.

67
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,840
So there's no credit reserve for that.

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,660
And then as you move out into greater and greater days past

69
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,730
due, by the time you get to 180 days past due,

70
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,130
there's really very little expectation

71
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,740
that you're going to collect very much, if anything

72
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,100
on that loan.

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,150
So this is basically an aging analysis

74
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,840
that we talked about earlier in the class.

75
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,350
Now what happens if there's a loan loss on capital?

76
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,610
So let's imagine the crisis starts,

77
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,670
we realize that we're under-reserved,

78
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,110
meaning that our allowance for loan losses is not big enough.

79
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,150
And we've got to double our allowance

80
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,350
from loan losses from 1% of assets to 2% of assets.

81
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,230
So this is just the same balance sheet

82
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,740
equation as we did before.

83
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,410
So if we add 1% of assets to loan losses,

84
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,400
that means we have to subtract 1% of assets

85
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,010
from stockholders' equity.

86
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,560
So that's going to lower our capital ratio before any tax

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,610
effects.

88
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,340
It's going to lower it by 1%.

89
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,790
And if we've got a 10% capital ratio,

90
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,500
this big provision here is going to knock that down by 10%

91
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,000
