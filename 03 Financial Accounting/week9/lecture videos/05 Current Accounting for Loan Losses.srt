JOHN CORE: All right, now what I want to do,

1
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:04,019
and this is going to be most of the remainder

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,870
of this discussion, is I'm going to talk

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,960
to you about a recent standard change that affects

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,420
the allowance for loan losses.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,000
This is quite complicated.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,030
I want to give you the intuition for this because it's

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,790
very controversial and it's really

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,640
affecting some banks their capital

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,400
because they have to reserve a lot more for loan losses.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,080


11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,790
So until just recently, so GAAP through 2019

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,160
was that we would provide for a loan loss if it were probable--

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,340
in red there-- probable that the loan was impaired.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,650
And probable in this language means likely or greater

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,190
than 50%.

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,530


17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,660
And this was called the incurred loss model.

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,319
So what it meant that if you were looking in a loan

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,320
and you thought there was only a 40% chance that it would

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,770
go bad, so that's still a pretty high probability

21
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,480
that it would go bad, but you would not reserve for that loan

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,380
until there was greater than a 50% chance of that loan

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,260
was going to go bad.

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,540
So essentially, this accounting was backward-looking.

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,090
So it wasn't until things got really bad with that loan

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,340
that there was greater than a 50% chance

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,060
that it was going to go bad.

28
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,150
And so in some sense, you were sitting

29
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,050
around waiting for bad news on your loans

30
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,730
to provide for the loan losses.

31
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:49,840
And perhaps because of this, with incurred loss accounting,

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,300
banks tend to be under-reserved at the start of bad times

33
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,510
and over-reserved at the start of good times.

34
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,790
So this is a picture from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis.

35
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,720
And what they're doing is just taking bank loans

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,430
and adding them all up, so the value of all bank loans.

37
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,930
And then they're taking the loan lost provision or the loan loss

38
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,420
allowance, adding that up, and then seeing how big it is.

39
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,060
So at the start of the financial crisis,

40
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,540
loan loss reserves as a percent of loans was about 1.2%.

41
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,100
So that's like late 2007 or early 2008.

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,410
Notice that in the crisis, which is

43
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:45,900
2008, 2009, and 2010, that loan loss reserve shoots up,

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,060
it triples.

45
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,710
So at the end of the crisis, loan loss reserves

46
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,310
are about 3 and 1/2% of total loans.

47
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,270
Then notice how as things get better that loan loss

48
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,880
reserve also drops over time.

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,220
And so what this means is that this is a pretend bank, Z Bank.

50
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,090
And Z Bank at the end of 2010, it

51
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,105
has a long loss reserve of $750 million, which is 3 and 1/2%

52
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:22,220
of its loans.

53
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,390
And at that time, it assumes that things are really, really

54
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,820
bad, as we can see from this picture here.

55
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,430


56
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,670
Now at some point, the economy recovers,

57
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,400
Z Bank doesn't need these really high reserves.

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,730
So let's imagine that happens in 2011.

59
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,410
And at the end of 2011, Z Bank estimates that it only

60
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,120
needs $300 in reserve.

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,720
So here's our allowance for loan losses,

62
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,570
beginning balance is 750.

63
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,270
We're going to solve for the provision for loan losses.

64
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,130
Write-offs are some amount.

65
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,360
And then our ending balance is 300.

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,590
Let's just also suppose that during 2011 we wrote off

67
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,530
$250 million worth of assets.

68
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,790
And then using Bayes, we can solve

69
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,950
for the provision for loan losses

70
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,000
during that period, which is a negative $200 million.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,660


72
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,180
And then the lingo in the banking industry, this

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,730
is what's called a reserve release.

74
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,390
So ordinarily you're adding to reserves.

75
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,470
So your provision for loan loss is a positive number.

76
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,890
But because we've over-reserved in the past

77
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,730
at the start of good times, when the good times actually

78
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,600
happens, we're going to release these reserves.

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,910
And so a Wall Street Journal article

80
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,380
from 2012 about this, these reserve releases

81
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,640
occur when banks add to their loan loss reserves

82
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,120
less than the write offs of their uncollectible loans.

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,240
And the difference here gets funneled, as the writer says,

84
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,010
into net income.

85
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,020
Nothing wrong with this.

86
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,300
Again, we just had a lot of reserves

87
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,500
at the start of the year.

88
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,420
We decided we didn't need them.

89
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,270
So those excess reserves, the reserve release

90
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,850
are being pulled into net income.

91
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,870
But what's striking is for the big US banks,

92
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,600
particularly Bank of America and Citigroup, almost 50%

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,840
of their net income was coming from reserve releases.

94
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,180
So the bank wasn't actually performing well.

95
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,790
It's just that the bank had over-reserved in the past.
