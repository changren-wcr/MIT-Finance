JOHN CORE: In this session, we're

2
00:00:01,525 --> 00:00:03,540
going to talk about accounting for banks.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,460
The banking industry is really interesting

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,310
but somewhat different.

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,190
So we've been focusing on industrial firms.

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,240
So we talked about AT&T, we talked about Hertz,

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,280
we talked about Amazon and Walmart.

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,980
So these are all industrial firms.

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,590
What we want to now do in this session

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,930
is extend these accounting concepts

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,280
to a much different industry, which is the banking industry.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,560
The goal of this session is to give you

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,620
an overview of the banking industry.

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,480
We're going to review and understand

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,310
a couple of prior concepts.

16
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,100
So we're going to, again, talk about how,

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,950
as you take on more leverage, that's

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,860
going to cause your return on equity to go up,

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,550
other things being equal.

20
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,420
So that's the DuPont formula that we talked

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,390
about several sessions ago.

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,770
And then we're also going to take

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,460
the concept of the allowance for bad debts

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,310
that we talked about in an earlier session

25
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,480
and extend this to an allowance for loan losses, which

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,070
is one of the major accounting concepts for banks.

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,630
So while these two concepts, DuPont method and the allowance

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,840
accounting, are likely going to be on the exam.

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,830
The remaining material that we're talking about for banks

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,420
is for your interest and it's not going to be on the exam.

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,220


32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,465
So as a little bit of background,

33
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:37,400
here's the S&P 500 sector ratings

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,970
given to us by Seeking Alpha.

35
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,200
And you notice that the box shows the financials.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,110
Just before the financial crisis,

37
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:54,470
financials were about 22% of the value of the S&P 500.

38
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,320
During the crisis, they fell as low as 9%.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,510
But right now, or at least in 2017,

40
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,930
they're back up to about 18%.

41
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,280
So financials are an important sector.

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,240
And it's important that we have some intuition about financials

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,930
as well as industrials.

44
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,840
So what we're going to do in this session, first of all,

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,520
I'm going to give you an overview of the form of bank

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,740
financial statements.

47
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,970
We'll look at some balance sheets and some income

48
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,030
statements.

49
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,600
Then we're going to review the relation between leverage

50
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,623
and return on equity using the DuPont method.

51
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,040
Then I might give you a little bit

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,530
of intuition for why banks need to be regulated,

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,640
so intuition for bank regulation.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,230
And then intuition for why regulators focus heavily

55
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,410
on bank leverage, which they measure

56
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,380
with the equity-to-assets ratio.

57
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,440
Then we're going to briefly review marketable securities

58
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,430
accounting and talk about its application

59
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,550
to the banking industry.

60
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,740
Then we're going to finally review

61
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,130
the allowance for bad debt and extend

62
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,570
this concept to an allowance for bank loan losses.

63
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,510
And then the banking industry is going through a big accounting

64
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,280
change right now.

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,760
And that changes the accounting for loan losses.

66
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,910
And I'm going to discuss that with you

67
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,760
and then give some intuition for the differences

68
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,950
in the standards.

69
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,150
So one of my case study companies

70
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,130
is going to be Wells Fargo.

71
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,560
Wells Fargo is one of the four largest

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,200
banks in the United States.

73
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,110
And this is their December of 2018 balance sheet.

74
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,510
So notice that the top of the balance sheet

75
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,740
are cash and investment securities, which are about 41%

76
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,530
of Wells Fargo's balance sheet.

77
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,980
And the accounting for this is the passive investments

78
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,730
marketable securities accounting that we talked about a couple

79
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,980
of sessions ago.

80
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,880
Biggest asset for banks typically are loans,

81
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,340
so banks make loans.

82
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,910
And so for Wells Fargo, loans are about 50%

83
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,500
of their balance sheet.

84
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,050
Biggest liability for banks are deposits.

85
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,950
So your checking account is a deposit.

86
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,460
If you get a certificate of deposit, that's a deposit.

87
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,590
So the primary liability for banks are deposits.

88
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,480
Notice that the total liabilities

89
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,500
for this bank, Wells Fargo, is about 90% of assets.

90
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,860
So banks are very highly levered.

91
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,510
And stockholders' equity, by contrast, is only about 10%

92
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,000
of assets.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,810
So Wells Fargo, again, is one of the biggest banks in the US.

94
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,640
It's got about $2 trillion worth of assets.

95
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,260
It's headquartered in California,

96
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,203
but it operates across the US and probably across the world.

97
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:11,590
I'm going to compare that with a very small regional bank, which

98
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,630
is United Financial.

99
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:20,690
It's got in 2018 about $7.5 billion worth of assets.

100
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,300
It's headquartered nearby, at least

101
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,330
nearby to me, in Connecticut.

102
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,090
And most of its operations are in Connecticut

103
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,590
and Massachusetts.

104
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,120
So when we compare the big bank, Wells Fargo,

105
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,745
with the small bank, United Financial,

106
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:40,530
a couple things stick out.

107
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,190
So in total, investment securities, cash, and loans

108
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,760
are about 90% of Wells Fargo's balance sheet.

109
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,370
And they're about 92% of United Financials' balance sheet.

110
00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:01,220
So even though we have enormous differences in bank size here,

111
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,530
these balance sheets essentially look the same.

112
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,430
The big difference is that Wells Fargo

113
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,490
has more in investment securities

114
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,670
and United Financial has more in loans.

115
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,450
Part of that is because, as a bigger organization,

116
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,650
it's easier for Wells Fargo to sell off loans

117
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,010
and to invest instead in investment securities.

118
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,770
It's more difficult for a smaller organization

119
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,190
like United Financial to sell off its loans

120
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,190
and turn them into investment securities.

121
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,910
Notice that both organizations have about 70%

122
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,820
of their total liabilities and equity in deposits.

123
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,910
And again, both of them have very high leverage.

124
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,770
Total liabilities is 90% of liabilities and equity.

125
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,740
And stockholders' equity is only about 10%.

126
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,210
So even though there are great differences in sizes,

127
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,300
asset and liability composition of the two banks

128
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,910
is not greatly different.

129
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,030
Here's Wells Fargo's 2018 income statement.

130
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,660
And this income statement looks different than the ones

131
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,860
that we've been looking at.

132
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,810
So at the top is interest income.

133
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,420
So banks have interest income instead of sales revenue.

134
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,310
Next line is interest expense.

135
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:31,010
This is analogous to or akin to cost of goods sold.

136
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,280
Interest income minus interest expense is net interest income.

137
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,060
This is akin to gross margin.

138
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,460
Provision for credit losses is something

139
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,960
we're going to be focusing on in this session,

140
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,560
but it's a big expense for the bank.

141
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,545
Non-interest revenue is fees.

142
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:53,020
So if you bounce a check or something like that,

143
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,020
that's non-interest revenue for a bank.

144
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,740
The bank may have some wealth management operations.

145
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,780
And then some of the larger banks

146
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,510
have investment banking operations.

147
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,540
And then non-interest expense is compensation expense,

148
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,300
expense for running the building, et cetera,

149
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,460
which is analogous to selling, general,

150
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,590
and administrative expense.

151
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,630
And then we got income before income tax expense,

152
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,480
which we know about.

153
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,760
We got income tax expense.

154
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,490
And then we've got net income, which we're also familiar with.

155
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,860
Just quickly comparing Wells Fargo

156
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,860
to United Financial in terms of their income statements,

157
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,070
notice that both of them have net interest

158
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,960
income of about 70% or 77%.

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,730
In the case of Wells Fargo, the provision for credit losses

160
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,710
is 3% of their interest income for both of them.

161
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,000
Now big difference here is that Wells Fargo, the bigger bank,

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,190
has a lot more non-interest revenue.

163
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,030
They've probably got more wealth management operations.

164
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,760
They may be doing some investment banking as well.

165
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,420
And because of that, their non-interest expense

166
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,630
is much larger.

167
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,420
But nevertheless, in terms of net income,

168
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,840
Wells Fargo has a higher profit margin

169
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,770
than does United Financial.
