00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,220
PROFESSOR: So within this regulatory capital framework,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,430
the basic issue in regulation is, does the bank

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,140
have enough capital?

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,380
Remember, capital is sort of adjusted common stockholders'

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,090
equity.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,040
So what we're going to talk about later in this session is,

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,840
are allowances for loan losses adequate?

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,230
So you can imagine that if the asset, which is loans,

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,420
are overstated, then so is capital.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,730
So an important regulatory issue is making sure

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,090
that loan loss reserves are appropriate.

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,650
Another important regulatory issue, especially

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:48,200
during the financial crisis, was are marketable securities,

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,010
and this includes mortgage-backed securities,

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,530
are those marketable securities accurately valued?

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,370
So if you remember, during the crisis, a lot of banks

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,950
bought something called collateralized mortgage

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,350
obligations, and the rating agencies mistakingly

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,210
rated those collateralized mortgage obligations as AAA.

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,230
So they were extraordinarily low risk

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,440
according to the rating agencies, and the reason

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,770
that that mattered is because when you bought

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,560
those collateralized mortgage obligations,

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,050
they had a very low risk weighting,

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,705
and you didn't have to hold much capital associated with them.

26
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,830
Of course, it turned out that those mortgage-backed

27
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,170
securities were very high risk, and so the accurate accounting

28
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,350
for marketable securities is also very important in banks.

29
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,610
So here's just a summary of a bank balance sheet on the left.

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,600
Looking at the bottom, major liabilities,

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,430
again, are deposits.

32
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,850
We also sometimes have some debt and other borrowings.

33
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,360
So we know the accounting for debt and other borrowings,

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,610
that's basically bond accounting.

35
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,090
Deposit accounting is also basically bond accounting.

36
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,919
So we know how to do the accounting

37
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,330
for the liability side of the bank's balance sheet.

38
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,280
I want to spend just a minute or two reviewing the accounting

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,390
for marketable securities or passive investment securities.

40
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,730
Remember, there's three buckets they can go into.

41
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,770
There's trading, available for sale, and held to maturity.

42
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,100
And then after we've talked about marketable securities,

43
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,160
we're going to do the accounting for loans which,

44
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,310
as I've said several times, is very similar to the accounting

45
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,410
for accounts receivable.

46
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,920


47
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,270
So remember, when we were doing passive investments,

48
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,680
there's three choices you can make.

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,410
So if you buy a bond, you can call it a held to maturity

50
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,230
bond, and the advantage of that is

51
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,580
there's never any accounting associated with it.

52
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,590
So you just hold it to maturity, you get your cash back,

53
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,170
and there's no intermediate accounting.

54
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,540
If you call it available for sale security, remember,

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,050
the value of those bonds is going

56
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,080
to fluctuate on your balance sheet, which

57
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,410
means it's going to fluctuate in stockholders' equity.

58
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,150
But remember that it's going to fluctuate

59
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,530
through other comprehensive income,

60
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,950
so there's not going to be any kind of income statement

61
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,490
effect.

62
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,140
Finally, our final accounting that we talked about

63
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,420
was trading securities accounting

64
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,020
where it's going to fluctuate in value on your balance sheet.

65
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,460
It's going to have an income statement effect.

66
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,730
This is a funny article from CFOworld from 2011.

67
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,780
The crisis starts in October 2008.

68
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,170
And it used to be that once you chose something was going

69
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,500
to be available for sale, there were complicated rules

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,580
for getting it out of available for sale.

71
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,900
Or once you chose that something was fair value through profit

72
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,200
or loss, there are complicated rules

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,220
for getting it out of that.

74
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,340
But the IASB, which is the standard-setter for IFRS,

75
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,480
basically sort of came up with an accounting solution,

76
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,790
and the accounting solution was banks

77
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,850
could move all their financial assets out

78
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,090
of trading securities, out of available for sale, where

79
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,580
they're going to fluctuate on the balance sheet

80
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,520
and fluctuate in regulatory capital,

81
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,950
and sort of get rid of those things

82
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,240
to such an extent that the National Bank of Greece,

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,430
and I don't really understand this actually,

84
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:50,590
why a bank would have 90% of its assets or a lot of its assets

85
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,750
in Greek government bonds.

86
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,200
It seems crazy.

87
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,280
But it invests in all these Greek government bonds,

88
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,160
and it moved them into loans and matur--

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,910
held to maturity and loans and receivables

90
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,420
because this basically allowed them to not

91
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,820
do any accounting for them that would affect

92
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,180
their regulatory capital.
