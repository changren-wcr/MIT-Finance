PROFESSOR: In this video, I would

1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,278
like to provide you with more detail about each

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:05,040
of the courses in the MicroMasters Program

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,200
in Finance.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,170
The program consists of five courses, foundations

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,460
of modern finance parts one and two, financial accounting,

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,370
derivatives markets, and mathematical methods

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,980
for quantitative finance.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,220
Learners may begin the program with any of the three entry

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,570
point courses.

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,760
Entry points into the program are foundations

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,910
of modern finance part one, financial accounting,

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,510
and mathematical methods for quantitative finance.

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,190
Foundations of modern finance is an important topic.

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,940
And in this program, we cover it in two courses,

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,040
foundations of modern finance part one,

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,850
and foundations of modern finance part two.

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,698
These two courses together provide

18
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:48,240
learners with a rigorous introduction

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,980
to the fundamentals of modern finance

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,040
and their applications to a variety of business decisions,

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,760
such as valuations of assets and securities, investment

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,350
decisions, risk management, and financing decisions.

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,900
We advise our learners to take both of these courses

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,630
and take them sequentially, as the second course

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,480
builds on the first one.

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,660
Financial accounting focuses on how companies provide

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,040
financial information to outside stakeholders like stockholders

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,840
and creditors.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,730
To understand a company, whether you

30
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,680
are chief executive officer and need

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,010
to make key strategic decisions or a hedge fund

32
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,560
manager deciding on whether to invest in a firm,

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,100
you must be able to read financial statements.

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,090
This course teaches you to analyze and understand them.

35
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,430
For this reason, this course is a required course

36
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,730
in most master of business programs.

37
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,890
Mathematical methods of quantitative finance

38
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,100
provides learners with advanced mathematical topics

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,700
in financial engineering and quantitative finance using

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,730
linear algebra, optimization, probability,

41
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,730
stochastic processes, and statistics.

42
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,800
You will learn applied computational techniques

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,220
frequently used in finance.

44
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,280
Finally, our fifth course, derivatives markets:

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,380
advanced modeling, and strategies,

46
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,400
provides learners with economic intuition and technical skills

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,120
necessary to understand how to use derivatives for investment

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,380
and risk management purposes and how to hedge and price them.

49
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,770
Upon completion of this course, learners

50
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,570
will have a sophisticated understanding

51
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,200
of tools for valuation and for quantifying, hedging,

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,630
and speculating on risk.

53
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,240
We recommend that learners take foundations of modern finance

54
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,790
parts one and two as prerequisites

55
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,980
to derivatives markets.

56
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,500
In general, the MicroMasters program in finance

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,460
offers many flexible paths to program completion.

58
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,950
Some of the most common roadmaps to program completion

59
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,730
can be found in the "Week 0" material for this course.

60
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,010
Each of the five courses have specific prerequisites.

61
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,850
For example, in order to take foundations of modern finance,

62
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,380
you need to know single variable calculus and linear algebra.

63
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,970
In order to take mathematical methods

64
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,060
for quantitative finance, you need a strong grounding

65
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,000
in probability theory, multivariate calculus,

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,220
and linear algebra.

67
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,380
You should also have at least basic familiarity

68
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,360
with programming.

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,180
