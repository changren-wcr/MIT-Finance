PROF.

1
00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:02,280
JOHN CORE: Welcome to Financial accounting.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,980
I'm John Core, the instructor for this course.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,640
In addition to welcoming you, I want

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,110
to motivate this course by giving you two reasons why you

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,900
will benefit from taking it.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,600
Accounting is the language of business.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,620
It is how firms communicate their financial performance.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,440
There are two major uses of accounting,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,460
and these two uses involve two groups of users.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,970
The first major use of accounting

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,310
is by managers inside firms to make decisions

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,670
and to determine compensation.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,450
For example, firms use accounting information

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,990
to decide whether to invest in a new plant

15
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,840
or to buy another company.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,660
In this case, accounting information

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,560
is an input into the capital budgeting decisions

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,130
you learn about in your finance classes.

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,310
A second example is the use of accounting information

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,340
to determine bonuses or compensation.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,580
At some point in your career your bonus

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,410
will be based on an accounting number,

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,000
and you will want to know how this number is computed

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,800
and how you can affect it.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,320
Because accounting information is so widely

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,980
used within companies, anyone whose career

27
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,010
is to work in companies, and ultimately

28
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,180
to help run these companies, needs familiarity

29
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,300
with accounting.

30
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,420
For this reason, a course like this

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,200
is required in most Master's of Business programs.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,590
The second major use of accounting

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,650
is by people outside the firm.

34
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,130
Lenders and investors use accounting information

35
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,540
to evaluate whether they will get an acceptable return

36
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,520
if they provide debt or equity capital to a firm.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,650
Lenders use accounting information

38
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,610
to assess whether a firm can repay a loan,

39
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,770
and use profitability and leverage

40
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,980
ratios to monitor the firm over the life of the loan.

41
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,200
Second, stock investors and investment bankers

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,040
use accounting information to value a firm

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,730
and to decide whether buying that firm's stock

44
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,150
will give an attractive return.

45
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,240
Using accounting information to assess

46
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,760
and value firms is widely done by finance professionals.

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,940
For this reason this course is required

48
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,960
in Master's of Finance programs such as this one.

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,210
Therefore, there are two major reasons

50
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,140
for taking this course and two groups of people who

51
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,350
will benefit from the course.

52
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,970
The first group is business professionals

53
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,280
who work inside companies.

54
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,550
The second group is finance professionals

55
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,830
who invest in companies.

56
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,090
If your immediate career goal is to be a finance professional,

57
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,290
the second reason will be your major motivation now.

58
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,470
But as you progress in your career,

59
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,540
you will become a manager and a decision maker.

60
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,990
Then the first reason will also become important.

61
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,810
You will need to know accounting to make decisions

62
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,190
within your organization and to understand your compensation

63
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,050
at that organization.

64
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,610
The bottom line is, to understand a company

65
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,400
from a finance perspective you must

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,280
be able to read financial statements.

67
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,040
This course teaches you to read and understand

68
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,030
financial statements.

69
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,510
We will start by understanding how the accounting

70
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,030
system records transactions.

71
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,440
For example, if a company buys equipment and pays cash,

72
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,970
how does the accounting system record this transaction.

73
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,320
Second, by understanding how these individual transactions

74
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,750
add up to become financial statements,

75
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,420
we will study the basic structure

76
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,329
of the three major financial statements, which

77
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,170
are the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash

78
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,840
flow statement.

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,600
We will then focus on extracting information

80
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,340
from these financial statements to assess corporate performance

81
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,250
and to compare different firms.

82
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,270
This course will also teach you to use financial statements

83
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,780
to gather inputs to valuation models

84
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,290
and for corporate finance decisions.

85
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,770
To teach you to read real financial statements

86
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,170
throughout the course, we use real companies

87
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,570
financial statements.

88
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:02,780
We will analyze in detail Amazon, Apple, AT&T, and Tesla,

89
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,080
and over 40 other companies.

90
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,050
I received my PhD in accounting from Wharton, and before my PhD

91
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,500
I worked in investment banking and in consulting.

92
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,380
I've been teaching at MIT for over 10 years.

93
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,760
I primarily teach versions of this course

94
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,570
to Master's of Finance students and to Master's of Business

95
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,560
students.

96
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,390
I also teach in the PhD program, and in the executive education

97
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,080
program.

98
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,690
My research spans a range of topics

99
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,890
in accounting, CEO compensation, and in corporate governance.

100
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,030
I will be working with you throughout this course,

101
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,190
and I hope that you will enjoy it.
