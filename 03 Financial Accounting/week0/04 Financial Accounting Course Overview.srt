00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,700
JOHN CORE: Now I will give you a brief description

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,590
of the structure and content of the course.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,540
This slide shows that the course has

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,280
four parts, and details what topics we will cover each week.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,680
In the following slides, I discuss

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,350
what we cover in each part.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,140
The introductory part A provides an overview of accounting,

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,350
why it is important, and how we account

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,960
for various transactions.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,350
These individual transactions add up

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,860
to become the three major financial statements, which

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,790
are the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,690
flow statement.

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,740
In this part we examine the building blocks

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,270
of accounting, which are accrual accounting and revenue

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,390
recognition.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,040
We apply these ideas to understand accounting

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,610
for five major assets on the balance sheet:

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:06,160
receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment,

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,190
also known as PPE, intangible assets, and investments

21
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,440
in other companies.

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:21,970
We illustrate these issues with case studies of Amazon, AT&T,

23
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,200
Hertz, and other companies.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,400
In this part, we also analyze the cash flow statement

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,290
and understand how it relates to the income statement.

26
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,820
In part B, we do an application, which is financial statement

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,310
analysis or FSA.

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,940
We use FSA to compare companies, and we

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,340
will learn ratios that compare companies

30
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:55,530
based on bankruptcy risk, profitability, and efficiency.

31
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,260
We illustrate these ratios using a case

32
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,710
study of the financial statements of Amazon

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,870
and Walmart.

34
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,770
These ratios are widely used by lenders

35
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,170
to help them decide how to price a loan,

36
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,180
and by equity investors in screening potential stock

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,340
investments.

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,700
In addition, the ratios are widely

39
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,130
used in compensation plans.

40
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,750
In part C, we examine liabilities and stockholders'

41
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,690
equity, with a particular focus on financing through debt,

42
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,640
leases, and stock.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,530
We begin by studying the accounting

44
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,520
for income taxes using examples from Goldman Sachs'

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,890
financial statements.

46
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,310
We then examine the accounting for debt financing

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,400
through the sale of bonds, and the accounting

48
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,660
for quasi debt financing through lease transactions.

49
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,190
We next study equity, or stock financing,

50
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,180
and the accounting for stock repurchases, dividends,

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,090
and stock splits using examples from AT&T's and Tesla's

52
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,860
financial statements.

53
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,820
We study earnings per share, or EPS,

54
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,670
using Twitter's financial statements as an example.

55
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,060
For most of the course, we focus on accounting

56
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,610
for industrial companies like AT&T and Tesla,

57
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,180
and retail companies like Amazon.

58
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,570
In our last session, we study banks and their more

59
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,870
specialized accounting.

60
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,650
In doing this, we review the accounting for investments

61
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,700
and we review the accounting for bad debt expense, which

62
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,180
in essence is the same as the accounting for loan

63
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,910
losses at banks.

64
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:02,000
In the final Part D, we do an extensive study of Tesla's 2019

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,290
financial statements.

66
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,300
Part of this study provides a review of prior material

67
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,220
to help you prepare for the final.

68
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,800
It will also introduce you to how

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,459
to use the financial statements to gather information

70
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,540
for valuing companies.

71
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,380
I will be working together with you throughout this course,

72
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,400
and I hope you will enjoy it.
