1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,860
PROFESSOR: We'll now discuss bad that's.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,850
Bad debt basically occurs when you made a sale to a customer,

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,280
but the customer is not likely to pay you

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,500
for the product you sold.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,710
There are two ways of accounting for bad debts.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,950
The direct method and the allowance method.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,480
In this recitation, will focus on allowance method.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,460
Within the allowance method, we'll

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,760
cover two methods, the percentage of sales method

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,590
and the aging method.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,479
Recall that the managing principal

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,320
is the idea that expenses should be matched to their revenues.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,660
In that spirit, allowance accounts

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,990
are used when we estimate future expenses.

15
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,850
We'll focus on allowance for doubtful accounts, or ADA.

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,150
Allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra asset account,

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,850
associated with accounts receivable.

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,180
Therefore, gross accounts receivable, minus ADA

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,080
is the net realizable value of accounts receivable.

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,570
In other words, when ADA is used,

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,120
the company anticipates that some accounts

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,050
will be uncollectible in advance of knowing the specific account

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,460
or amount.

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,460
Bad debt expense is often an estimate

25
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,190
to more closely match the sale, which

26
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,770
in turn, increases relevance, but lowers reliability.

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,590
As mentioned, there are two methods for estimating ADA.

28
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,860
First, the percentage of sales method estimates

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,100
expected losses as a percentage of credit sales

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,870
during the period.

31
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,180
The intuition here is that the more you sell,

32
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,080
the more you're likely to make a loss from some proportion

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,210
of the sales.

34
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,110
Second, the aging method estimates expected losses

35
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,690
based on the age of the receivables.

36
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,800
Here, the intuition is that the longer you have not been paid,

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,710
the less you're likely to collect that amount.

38
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,890
The exact estimation method that each company uses

39
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,270
is often found in the footnote of the annual report.

40
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,210
Recall the BASE equation for changes

41
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,060
and balance sheet amounts in the lecture.

42
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,750
Every balance sheet uses the same BASE equation,

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,940
and this is going to be useful, especially

44
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,120
for calculating ADA, as well as the ending balance of the ADA.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
First, there is beginning balance,

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,870
the beginning ADA rolled over from the prior year.

47
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,040
From the beginning balance, we add bad debt expense,

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,440
subtract write offs, and then arrive at the ending balance.

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,540
Note that the percentage of sales method

50
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,810
gives bad debt expense, this allows us

51
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,970
to compute the ending balance.

52
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,840
Whereas, the aging analysis gives the ending balance,

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,530
and then allowing us to compute the bad debt expense.

54
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,260
In summary, it's important to understand

55
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,270
the definition of each line item,

56
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,460
and the impact on financial statements

57
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,490
for certain transactions.

58
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,770
I'll go over them one by one.

59
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,250
Accounts receivable is defined as, customer purchases

60
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,190
made on account, i.e. credit.

61
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,650
You'll receive payment later.

62
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,660
This impacts the income statement

63
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,830
by recognizing revenue when earned and not received.

64
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,230
Balance sheet, the accounts receivables account

65
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,270
under assets will be affected.

66
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,210
Allowance for doubtful accounts is company provisions

67
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,120
for uncollectible accounts receivable.

68
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,530
The impact on income statement depends on how ADA changes.

69
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,970
On the other hand, contra asset account,

70
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,670
the ADA account is impacted.

71
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,100
Bad debt expense is future projections

72
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,560
for uncollectible accounts receivables,

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,470
assuming the percentage of sales method.

74
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,750
On the income statement, expenses

75
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,690
recognized as percentage of sales.

76
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,570
On the balance sheet, ADA is increased by the same amount.

77
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,450
Write-off happens when it becomes evident that

78
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,670
the customer cannot pay.

79
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,800
It is the accounts receivables that

80
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,710
goes bad in that time period.

81
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,530
There is no impact on the income statement,

82
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,690
and on the balance sheet, it reduces

83
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,579
ADA and accounts receivable.

84
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,740
How are these accounts receivable

85
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,940
related transactions represented in the actual 10-Ks?

86
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,240
In this slide, I show a sample 10-K,

87
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,970
how the base equation can be shown in the 10-K statements.

88
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,810
A second row balance at the beginning of period

89
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:44,410
shows the beginning ADA balance of 103 in February 1st, 2019.

90
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,320
The next row, provision charged to income statement,

91
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,630
is the bad debt expense, or the additions to the beginning ADA

92
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,580
balance.

93
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,630
We subtract bad debt write offs, which is amount

94
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,160
deemed uncollectible, 95 million in this particular financial

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,490
statement.

96
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,180
Finally, we arrive at the balance

97
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,910
at the end of a period, which is the ending ADA balance.
