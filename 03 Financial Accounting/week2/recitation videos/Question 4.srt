1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:04,730
PROFESSOR: Question four is on accounts receivables.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,620
Refer to Ruddick Corp's 2012 annual report.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,480
Question A, for the year ended October 2, 2012,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,020
how much bad debt expense did Ruddick Corp recognize

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,880
on its income statement?

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,650
How much accounts receivables did Ruddick Corp write off?

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,740


8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,170
Refer to column C of the fiscal year

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,200
ended 2012, the bottom row.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,360
Bad debt expense is shown as $556,000.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,570
On the other hand, column D of the same row

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,800
shows that the write off amount is $379,000.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,650
Question B, how does bad debt expense

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,540
change from 2010 to 2011?

15
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,600
Assume that Ruddick Corp uses the percentage of sales method

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,210
to calculate bad debt expense.

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,510
For what reasons might the change in bad debt expense

18
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,360
have occurred?

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,620
As you can see in column C of Ruddick's financial statements

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,830
shown in the past slide, bad debt expense

21
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:24,620
decreased from $775,000 in 2010 to $164,000 in 2011.

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,830
Why did the bad debt expense decrease that much?

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,960
There could be a number of potential reasons

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,730
but to name a few Ruddick Corp may use a new lower estimate

25
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,830
of the uncollectible accounts resulting

26
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,020
from improved collections.

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,980
It may also have made lower sales in 2011.

28
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,650
We don't know their sales number just by looking at the slide,

29
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,750
so this is possible.

30
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,020
Finally, Ruddick Corps management

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,540
could have intentionally reduced the bad debt expense in 2011.
