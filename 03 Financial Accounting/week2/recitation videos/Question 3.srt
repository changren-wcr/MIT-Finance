00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,440
PROFESSOR: Question three, Tootsie

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,510
Roll receives royalty revenue related

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,480
to licensing fees generated from other companies

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,270
using the Tootsie Roll trademark.

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,900
Assume that on December 31, 2007,

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,870
Tootsie Roll received $4,975 in cash from a European company

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,900
to use their trademark for the next two years, i.e.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,770
2008 and 2009.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:32,250
The legal costs associated with this transaction were $1,349,

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,050
and Tootsie Roll paid these costs on December 31, 2007.

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,950
Tootsie Rolls accounting policy for this type of transaction

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,340
is to record all of the revenue when the cash is received

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,640
and match the expenses to the revenue.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,570
the company has a fiscal Year end on December 31.

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,970
Part A, use the balance sheet equation

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,910
to identify the transaction Tootsie Roll recorded

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,020
on December 31, 2007.

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:08,080
Tootsie Roll is receiving $4,975 on December 31, 2007,

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,350
and its accounting policy is to record all the revenue when

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,460
cash is received and match the expenses to revenue.

21
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,920
Therefore, we recognize $4,975 in revenues

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,740
as well as the legal costs that were associated

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,090
with this revenue, i.e $1,349.

24
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,640
The balance sheet equations for these transactions

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,060
are as follows.

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,780
First, we record an increase in cash by $4,975

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,720
and a corresponding $4,975 increase in retained earnings

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,800
to recognize the revenue.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,310
Second, we record a decrease in cash by $1,349

30
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,080
and decrease in retained earnings

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,410
by the same amount as legal expenses.

32
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,080
I suggest to include what exactly the revenues

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,590
and expenses were when retained earnings change.

34
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,920
For example, in the legal expenses

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,009
you would want to record under retained earnings

36
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:15,100
the legal expense as the specific expense account.

37
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,860
Part B, suppose instead they decided

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,350
to spread their revenue and costs associated

39
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,890
with the Royalty payment over the two year contract, again,

40
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,290
matching the expense to the revenue.

41
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,570
Use the balance sheet equation to identify

42
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,970
the transaction Tootsie Roll recorded on December 31, 2007.

43
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,240
In this case, revenue is not recognized but categorized

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,740
as deferred revenue.

45
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:45,370
Since Tootsie Roll still receive cash, cash increases by $4,975.

46
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,900
In addition, deferred revenue account,

47
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,370
which is under liabilities also increases by the same amount.

48
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,400
Assets equals liabilities plus equity so BSE balances out.

49
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,860
For the legal charges since the company still

50
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,980
paid the expenses in cash, cash decreases by $1,349.

51
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,360
On the other hand, prepaid expenses,

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,560
which is an asset account, increases by the same amount

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,460
to balance the BSE out.

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,070
Part C, assuming the facts in part B,

55
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,460
use the balance sheet equation to identify the transaction

56
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,810
to see recorded on December 31, 2008.

57
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,840
Part B says that revenue and costs are spread out

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,550
over the two year contract.

59
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,630
In December 31, 2008, half of the deferred revenues incurred

60
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,080
in December 31, 2007 are realized,

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,040
and half of the prepaid expenses are converted to expenses.

62
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,770
Therefore, half of the deferred revenues,

63
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:51,630
which is $2,487.50 will be realized as revenue and half

64
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,870
of the prepaid expenses, which is $674.50, will be realized.

65
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,650
To express these transactions using balance sheet equation,

66
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,590
deferred revenue decreases by $2,487.50,

67
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,770
and retained earnings increases by the same amount.

68
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,990
Prepaid expenses decreases by $674.50,

69
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,589
and retained earnings decreases by the same amount.

70
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,380
There is no change in cash since no cash

71
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,100
has been flowed out or in.
