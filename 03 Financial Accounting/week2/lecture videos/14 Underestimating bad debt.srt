1
00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:01,410
PROFESSOR: So in the prior slide,

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,970
we saw our gross accounts receivable was $12,456,

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,660
and our allowance for doubtful accounts was $85.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,720
So that's just summarizing from the prior slide.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,650
We began with $12,456, and we had an allowance

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,690
for doubtful accounts of $85.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,920
Now, what would happen if our write-offs

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,570
were much bigger than expected?

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,040
So imagine that our write offs were $185 million.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,170
So we record that there.

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,100
What that means is we had a beginning allowance

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,650
for doubtful accounts of $85.

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,070
Now, we have to write off $185 million,

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,490
and we don't have enough in the balance of allowance

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,790
for doubtful accounts to take care of those write-offs.

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,350
So what we do then is have our accountants look

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,020
at our accounts receivable, figure out

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,400
how much our balance should be after the write-off.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,060
Let's imagine they say the balance should be $100 million

20
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,440
after the write-off.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,900
So after this write-off, we should

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,170
have a balance of $100 million, and then we

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,460
can back into or solve for the additional bad debt accrual.

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,410
So because we've underestimated it in the past, at this point,

25
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,980
we have to add an additional $200 million.

26
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,130
And that'll always keep our allowance

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,350
for doubtful accounts with a positive balance.
