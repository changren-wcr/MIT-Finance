00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
PROFESSOR: So here's our spreadsheet.

1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,660
Up at the top where it says BB is our beginning balance.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,880
Remember, that's our balance sheet from year one.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,370
So in that balance sheet for example,

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,280
we had cash of $31,000.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,250
We had accounts receivable of $4,000 and so on.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,980
In our first transaction, we're going

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,150
to ship the remainder of our inventory to Julie's company.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,920
And Julie's company is going to pay us cash at $24,000.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,960
So remember, the first thing we want to do

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,160
is keep track of cash.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,010
So we get cash of $24,000.

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,500
Now balance the balance sheet equation.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,180
Best way to do that is generally to plug retained earnings.

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,960
So we got retained earnings increase of $24,000.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,710
That's part of the revenues we got.

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,190
And now when we ship these goods to Julie's company,

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,019
we're fulfilling our agreement with them.

18
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,890
So our deferred revenue goes away.

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,290
The deferred revenue goes away.

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,450
And it becomes regular revenue.

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,450
So associated with this transaction,

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,140
we're going to recognize $30,000 of total revenue.

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,020
And we've done that on separate lines

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,010
just to keep track of what we're doing.

25
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,120
Now remember, we shipped some goods to Julie's company.

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,170
We shipped the remaining inventory to Julie's company.

27
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,380
So to reflect that on our balance sheet equation,

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,280
we're going to remove $5,000 from inventory.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,880
And now we need to balance the balance sheet equation.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,570
And again, if in doubt, put it in a retained earnings.

31
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,220
It goes and retained earnings.

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,760
And the annotation there is COGS.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,650
That's our cost of goods sold.

34
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,050
Our second transaction, we pay off our accounts payable.

35
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,550
First, keep track of cash.

36
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,330
Cash goes down by $10,000.

37
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,210
Accounts payable goes away.

38
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,010
In our third transaction, we pay off wages payable.

39
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,740
Cash goes down by 4,000.

40
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,630
The wages payable liability goes down by $4,000.

41
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,090
In our fourth transaction, we receive payment on our accounts

42
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,480
receivable.

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,010
So again, cash is going to go up by $4,000.

44
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,880
And that accounts receivable, which

45
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,790
we're going to talk more about it in this class,

46
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,040
it goes away because it turns into cash.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,600
Fifth, we're going to pay--

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,480
we're going to incur and pay wages of $12,000.

49
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,520
So we got $12,000 of wage expense.

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,280
And our final transaction is we're going

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,750
to pay a dividend of $9,000.

52
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,550
So cash goes down by $9,000.

53
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:06,130
And then retained earnings goes down by the $9,000 dividend.

54
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,280
So we're almost done at this point.

55
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,230
Notice that we have this entry at the bottom, Adj Ent, which

56
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,550
means an adjusting entry.

57
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,490
So we need to look at our assets--

58
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,640
and real accountants do this-- and look at our assets

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,890
and see whether our assets are overvalued.

60
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,800
And we look up to prepaid rent.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,620
Remember, we prepaid this rent for this year.

62
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,360
Now the year has gone by, so we no longer have an asset.

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,520
So that asset of prepaid rent, the $6,000,

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,535
turns into an expense to reflect the fact that we used up

65
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:46,035
the asset.

66
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:48,730


67
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,530
Now remember, this is, at least in concept,

68
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,550
an Excel spreadsheet.

69
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,330
So now what we want to do is add all the columns down,

70
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,420
and make sure that assets equals liabilities

71
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,900
plus stockholders' equity.

72
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,840
So ending balance, we've got $24,000 in cash.

73
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,440
And we got the $24,000 in contributed capital.

74
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,279
So we got an asset of $24,000 in cash,

75
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,850
$24,000 in contributed capital.

76
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,940
This is a really simple balance sheet.

77
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,970
At the end of the second year, Peter's company

78
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,580
is no longer an operating company.

79
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,040
And all it has on its balance sheet

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,830
is a bunch of cash, which is owned

81
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,940
by its original stockholders.
