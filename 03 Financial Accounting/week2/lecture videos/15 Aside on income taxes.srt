1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,050
PROFESSOR: All right, as a quick aside--

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,520
and this is looking ahead to our class on income taxes.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,530
Remember, the direct method that we just

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,530
illustrated a few minutes ago is required

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,895
for income tax returns.

6
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,480


7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,250
For GAAP, you have to use either percentage of sales or aging

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,610
of accounts receivable.

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,150
So imagine that Dell uses percentage of sales

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,990
for its financial statements.

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,630
So think about it.

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,990
In general, will our bad debt expense under the direct method

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,780
equal our bad debt expense on our income statement?

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,210
So clearly not.

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,440
So as we've done in the examples above,

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,500
at any one point in time, our write-offs

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,980
can be more or less than our bad debt expense.

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,990
And this just shows you that there's

19
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,170
a different set of accounting for financial accounting

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,920
purposes and a different set of accounting for tax accounting

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,489
purposes.

22
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,430
So because of these differences, in general, how much we

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,700
expense for tax purposes is going

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,360
to be different than how much we expense for financial reporting

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,010
purposes.

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:24,430
And assuming the revenues are the same, our cash taxes--

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,340
our taxable income is going to be

28
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,190
greater or less than our financial reporting

29
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,970
income, which means that taxes paid are

30
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,130
going to be, in general, different than tax expense.

31
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,450
So when you're thinking, if I deduct

32
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,880
this expense for financial reporting purposes,

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,950
it's going to lower my taxes, that's, in general, not correct

34
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,740
because just because something's an expense

35
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,600
for financial reporting purposes does not mean it

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,520
is an expense for tax purposes.

37
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,930
And we'll come back to this.
