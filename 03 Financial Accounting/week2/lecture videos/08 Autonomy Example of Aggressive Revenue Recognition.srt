00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,930
JOHN CORE: Now let's do a famous example, Hewlett-Packard

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,810
company, HP, bought Autonomy, which is a UK software company.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,490
And it paid $11 billion for it in 2011.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,550
A year later, HP wrote down the value of Autonomy,

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,410
and it valued at $2 billion.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:29,040
So in a year on that investment, HP lost 80% of its money.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,980
Now think about your own investing activities.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,310
Think about how many times have you lost 80% in one year?

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,410
It hurts.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,310
And this was an $11 billion investment.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,060
So HP has sued Autonomy and said that Autonomy overstated

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,200
its revenues, and because revenues were too high,

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,980
earnings were too high, and therefore, Autonomy's stock

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,110
price was too high.

15
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,880
Because Hewlett-Packard did not recognize these overstatements,

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,550
it overpaid for Autonomy.

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,850
HP alleges that Autonomy overstated its revenues

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,170
by turning software service deals into software licensing

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,350
deals.

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,760
Why does it matter if software is a license or a service?

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,750
So if I sell you a license, I've given you

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,260
everything up front so I can recognize most of my revenue

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,090
and earnings up front.

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,040
If it's a service, I'm promising to give you software over time,

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,040
and revenue is going to be recognized,

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,070
and earnings are going to be recognized over time

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,585
as the services are provided.

28
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:45,650


29
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,180
And this sort of dribbled out, but one nice story about this

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,960
is The Insider Reveals Creative Autonomy Accounting,

31
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,680
where Autonomy did a four year software as a service deal,

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,010
so this is something that we should recognize revenue

33
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,590
on over a four year period.

34
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,030
It morphed it into a software licensing contract, and one

35
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,160
of the ways they did that was structure it

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,170
so that most of the fees were deemed to be for licensing,

37
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,620
and by doing this, Autonomy was able to book

38
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,280
most of the revenue up front, and by booking the revenue up

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,190
front, it makes it look like Autonomy

40
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,790
was growing a lot faster than it really was.

41
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,060
Now one way you can maybe see this

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,010
in published financial statements,

43
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:42,240
this is Autonomy's revenue for the year 2008, 2009, 2010.

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,490
So 2010 was the year before they got bought by Hewlett-Packard.

45
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,740
Notice how fast revenue's growing.

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,410
Revenue grows from $503 million to $870 million.

47
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,160
I also gathered from the balance sheet

48
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,770
the deferred revenue account, and what

49
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,470
we're interested in here is the change in deferred revenue.

50
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,900
So how much revenue was classified during the year

51
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,430
as deferred revenue?

52
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,620
That's what the change is.

53
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,210
And notice that in 2009, we had change

54
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,560
in deferred revenue, or new deferred revenue, was about 10%

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,850
of total revenue, whereas in 2010, that number

56
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,190
drops to less than 1%.

57
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,960
So it suggests that maybe Autonomy, at least in 2010,

58
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,440
was not deferring as much revenue as it had in the past.

59
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,110
So this gives you a way to look at financial statement analysis

60
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,210
to give you some insight into what companies are doing.
