00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,720
JOHN CORE: So now we've wrapped up, for the time being,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,680
revenue recognition.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,520
Now we want to do is talk about estimates.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,570
In particular, estimates for bad debt expense and

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,940
estimates or returns.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,740
So remember, in Shrek 2, we talked about product returns

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,440
and Dreamworks' failure to correctly estimate

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,290
these returns.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,500
Now we're going to look at accounts receivable

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,580
and think about why do firm give credit--

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,350
if customers are not going to pay, why do firms give credit?

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,850
Well, the answer to this is to generate revenue.

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,550
So if you make it easier for people

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,460
to buy stuff by giving them credit,

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,510
maybe they'll buy even more stuff.

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,200
If they don't pay, this is a bad debt expense

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,420
that we need to match the revenues,

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,090
but by giving them credit, we've encouraged

19
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,430
them to buy even more, so even after they

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,970
don't pay for all of it, we're still ahead

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,480
of where we would be if we were in a cash business.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,330
So for the remainder of this class,

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,680
we're going to talk about when we generate revenues--

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,900
in particular, credit revenues--

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,680
when a customer gives me an accounts receivable,

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,780
how do I estimate how much of that

27
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,750
accounts receivable is going to be bad debt,

28
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,170
and how do I allow for that bad debt

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,100
so that I can match my expenses to my revenues?

30
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,730
And we're going to look at it in the context of Dell.

31
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,780
So Dell's business model, what's the business?

32
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,770
So we all know Dell is a computer company.

33
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,090
Who are Dell's customers and how do they pay?

34
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,820
Well, they're retail people, like you and me,

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,150
and they're wholesale people like corporate businesses.

36
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,470
Some of them pay in cash, and some of them pay in credit.

37
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,080
And again, why do we give them credit?

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,130
Because we want to give them the opportunity

39
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,830
to buy more stuff from us, and therefore,

40
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,320
generate more revenues.

41
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,020
Does Dell appear to be successful?

42
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,320
We've got high revenue growth and our stock price

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,310
has done very well.

44
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,760
So Dell is a big and successful company.

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,540


46
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,780
Here's an example of a Dell product.

47
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,300
So this is their fold over laptop, which, if you buy it,

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,060
you get 12 months no interest financing.

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,730
So they're allowing you to buy it and not

50
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,500
pay for it for whole year.

51
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,510
So they're allowing you to buy it

52
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,970
with a year's worth of credit.

53
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,570
So again, why do they do that?

54
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,560
Because people are more likely to buy this computer

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,675
if they don't have to pay for it right now.

56
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:51,450


57
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,360
Now let's remember our revenue transactions

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,210
from earlier in the class, and we're focused now

59
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,740
on we sell a computer costing $500,

60
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,010
and we sell it for $1,000 on accounts receivable.

61
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,540
So here's our balance sheet equation for it.

62
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,860
The question for this part of the class

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,150
is we give somebody credit of $1,000, what happens

64
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,100
if that somebody doesn't pay?

65
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,960
So Dell, in this case, is going to have

66
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,340
some kind of bad debt expense.

67
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,690


68
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,120
And we're going to talk about two ways of accounting

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,540
for the bad debt expense.

70
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,770
The first method is called the direct method

71
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,230
and the second method is called the allowance method.

72
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,870
I may just show you the direct method

73
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,990
to give you some intuition for what's going on,

74
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,510
and also, the direct method is required

75
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,060
for income tax purposes.

76
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,780
And then we're going to then discuss two allowance methods.

77
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,590
One is the percentage of sales method,

78
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,700
and the second is the aging method.
