00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
PROFESSOR: Now, to make up an income statement,

1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,100
remember and review the income statement

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,830
lives over in the retained earnings section,

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,270
except for dividends.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,990
So our income statement looks like this.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,130
We've got revenue, cost of goods sold.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,570
We got our gross margin, or gross profit,

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,230
which is revenue minus cost of goods sold.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,290
We've got our rent expense, and we got our wage expense.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,710
We've got net income of 7.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,110
So just check over this to make sure

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,100
that you're comfortable that this is the income statement.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,730
Now we're going to make a cash flow statement.

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,530
Remember, the cash flow statement

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,920
lives in the column on the left, which

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,265
is Cash, which shows the change in cash for the period.

16
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:51,800


17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,010
And if we arrange that cash flow statement,

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,700
we began with $31,000 in cash.

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,390
We had cash flow from our operations of 2, which

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,730
consisted of the cash that we got

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,820
from our customers less the cash payment

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,620
that we made to our supplier, or our vendor, less our cash wages

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,000
payable.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,340
And then finally, we have a cash flow

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,340
from financing, which is the dividend, which

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,600
gives us ending cash.

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,850


28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,060
So looking, again, at our performance measures, which

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,440
are net income and cash flow from operations,

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,300
in the first year, remember we had net income of $3,000, cash

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,350
flow from operations of $8,000, so accruals

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,910
were a minus $5,000.

33
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,340
And then just summarizing from above, in the second year

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,260
we have net income of $7,000, cash flow from operations

35
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:58,120
of $2,000, so our accruals were $5,000 for the year.

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,880
And then if we total these across,

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,800
we see that we have net income of $10,000 equals cash flow

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,590
from operations, and accruals sum

39
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,970
to 0 over the two-year period.

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,180
And this illustrates, in a sort of toy example,

41
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,850
a very important concept, which is over the life of the firm,

42
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,300
net income is going to equal to cash flow from operations.

43
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,430
So over the life of the firm-- this firm-- net income was 10.

44
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,460
Cash flow from operations was 10.

45
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,900
And accruals were 0.

46
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,810
Because of the fact that, over the life of the firm,

47
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,990
net income and cash flow from operations are equal,

48
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,270
that means over the life of the firm, accruals are 0.

49
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,870
And that further means that if you have small accruals

50
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,490
early in the life of the firm-- so

51
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,500
with negative accruals in year 1 are going to reverse and become

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,240
positive accruals in year 2.

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,120
So accruals are going to reverse.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,800
If you have a big accrual in one year,

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,890
it tends to become a small accrual the next year.

56
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,530
You have a big negative accrual one year,

57
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,910
it tends to be a big positive accrual the next year.

58
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,040
So what this means is that if we manipulate earnings

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,380
by manipulating accruals upward, that upward manipulation

60
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,670
tends to reverse in the next year.

61
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,160
This, in turn, means that it's very difficult

62
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,130
to sustain earnings manipulation,

63
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,590
because the manipulation tends to reverse over the next year.

64
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,610
So we'll come back to this when we discuss the cash flow

65
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,460
statement.
