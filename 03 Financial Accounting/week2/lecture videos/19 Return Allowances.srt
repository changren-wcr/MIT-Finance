1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,890
PROFESSOR: | we just talked about the allowance

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,160
for doubtful accounts or the allowance for bad debt.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,770
Now we want to talk about a second related thing, which

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,060
is the allowance for returns.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,290
So when you buy something from Amazon, as I'm sure many of you

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:20,950
have, many of you also return some of that stuff to Amazon,

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,760
and the correct accounting for that is we

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,910
don't record revenues on everything that we sell.

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,520
We record revenues on stuff that we

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,580
sell less some kind of expectation

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,350
for how much returns we're going to get.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,910
So the liability for return allowances

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,910
is analogous to the allowance for doubtful accounts.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,090
The only thing that's different here

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,700
is that we've taken the contra-asset, which

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,850
is a negative asset, and moved it over and made

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,930
it a liability.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,290
But we do the accounting for this on the liability side.

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,610
And when the return happens, because we've

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,940
allowed for the return ahead of time

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,520
when the return actually happens it's not

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,860
going to reduce revenues and it's not

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,220
going to reduce net income.

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,520
So returning to Shrek and Dreamworks, remember,

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,430
let's suppose that Dreamworks ships 100 million

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,920
of Shrek DVDS in November of 2004.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,820
And the time it ships them, it expects 50% of them

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,973
to be returned.

29
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:33,390
For this example, we're just going

30
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,830
to ignore cost of goods sold.

31
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:42,510
So our accounting is going to be, we ship out $100 million

32
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,690
worth of stuff.

33
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,930
So we get accounts receivable of $100 million.

34
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,880
We got revenue of $100 million, but we're

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,160
going to recognize this liability

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,990
for returns of $50 million.

37
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,730
And we're going to reduce revenue by $50 million.

38
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,330
So we shipped out $100 million worth of stuff,

39
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,020
but we expect to get 50 million of it back.

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,320
So we've really only gotten 50 million worth of revenue.

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,980


42
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,310
And then in December, some of these DVDS are returned.

43
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,250
So 30 million of them are returned.

44
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,460
Accounts receivable is going to go down by $30 million

45
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,140
at that time.

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,980
Allowance or returns are going to go down by $30 million.

47
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,120
So if we ship no more DVDS in 2004,

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,150
our revenues are going to be $50 million,

49
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,390
which is the 50 million worth of revenue

50
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,490
minus the allowance for returns of $50 million.

51
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,500
Our accounts receivable will be $70 million.

52
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,610
So $100 million in gross accounts receivable

53
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,890
minus the accounts receivable that were returned for us

54
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,300
and then our net liability for return allowances at the end

55
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,320
of 2004 is $20 million.

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,600
And so that's a stylized example.

57
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,490
So notice the difference here with the bad debt expense

58
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,780
is the allowance for returns reduces revenue,

59
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,750
whereas bad debt expense increases expense.

60
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,650
But both of them have the same effect on net income.

61
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,680
So that's a stylized example of the liability return analysis.

62
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,150
Now let's look at Amazon's note on return allowances to get us

63
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,110
a sense for what this looks like in the real world, OK.

64
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,580
So Amazon has a liability for return allowances, which

65
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,650
reduce revenue and cost of sales or cost of goods sold,

66
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,965
and they estimate that using historical experience.

67
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:56,340
So based on Amazon in historical experience

68
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,370
when they ship a billion worth of stuff out,

69
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,130
they expect to get like 10 million of it back.

70
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,740
So the balance of their liabilities or return

71
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,610
allowances in the second line there, they

72
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,800
include that in accrued expenses and others

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,960
so as a current liability.

74
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,740
So this is how much their liabilities for the return

75
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,832
allowances are in 2018, $623 million.

76
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,990
Then they tell you how much they added

77
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,110
to the allowance along with sales,

78
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,980
and they tell you how much they had just

79
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,050
deducted from the allowance when things were sent back to them.

80
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,520
Now what we didn't have in the Shrek example

81
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,420
a minute ago was when Amazon gets

82
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,850
something returned so if you buy a DVD from Amazon

83
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,700
and then return it to Amazon, Amazon

84
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,120
gets that DVD back and at least in theory

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,620
puts it back into inventory.

86
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,300
So what Amazon is telling you in the final couple of lines

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,080
there is that included in inventories

88
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,510
are goods that they expect to be returned.

89
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,990
So they've actually shipped these goods out,

90
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,930
but because they expect them to be returned

91
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,880
they keep those in inventory.

92
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,660
So Amazon's inventories includes items

93
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,080
that Amazon owns right now and also items that Amazon expects

94
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,500
their customers to return.

95
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,000
