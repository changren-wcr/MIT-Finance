00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450


1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,908
PROFESSOR: So now we're going to do

2
00:00:01,908 --> 00:00:04,290
some examples of the new revenue recognition standard,

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,200
and we're going to base them on the Spartan case that

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,940
was assigned reading.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,040
So let's think about what Spartan does.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,620
So it runs the Spartan Races.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,100
So one product it sells is race entry.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,320
It may sell a parking space.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,830
It may sell a commemorative jacket.

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,440
It sells annual race passes.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,400
So instead of a single entry, you can buy a full year entry.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,660
It sells advertising and sponsorship, training classes,

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,450
and certification.

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,630
So we're going to just look at a couple of these products

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,930
and talk about revenue recognition for these products.

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,600


17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,220
So first example, say, on January 1st,

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,980
Spartan sells me an annual raise pass for $1,000.

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,700
So these things truly do cost this amount.

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,010
Does everybody knows what a Spartan Race is?

21
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,510
This is where you just go climb over logs in obstacle courses,

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,960
takes like six hours.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,269
You're all muddy.

24
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,620
You feel awful at the end.

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,390
There's a high injury rate.

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,220
But people pay money to do this.

27
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,950
So if Spartan sells me an annual pass for $1,000,

28
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,760
how does this affect Spartan's financial statements?

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,740
Looking at the balance sheet equation--

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,530
so one way we could do the accounting

31
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,340
for this is count all the revenue at the time of sale--

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,990
so take in cash of 1,000, increase retained earnings

33
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,720
by revenue 1,000.

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,630
The second thing we could do is--

35
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,030
when Spartan sells me this pass, it

36
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,410
hasn't provided me any services.

37
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,540
I get to race in the future.

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,600
So that accounting, which turns out

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,110
to be the correct accounting, is Spartan gets some cash

40
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,070
and it recognizes a liability for deferred revenue

41
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,550
because it's going to provide me the ability to do these races

42
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,580
in the future.

43
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,259
Then, either as time passes or as the race

44
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,930
has occurred but by the end of the year,

45
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,740
we're going to gradually amortize the deferred revenue

46
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,710
and take it into regular revenue.

47
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,810
So which is correct?

48
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,440
As we already talked about, deferring it and then

49
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,290
recognizing it as time passing is a correct way to do it.

50
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,610
Now let's do a second example which is a little bit more

51
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,370
complicated.

52
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,380
And this brings to mind the iPhone example we just did.

53
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,800
So for $800, Spartan sells me a season pass and a jacket

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,880
as a package.

55
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,520
So I get the season pass.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,750
I also get a jacket.

57
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,390
Let's pretend that the jacket costs Spartan $50 to make,

58
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,770
and Spartan can sell the jacket in the outside market for $200.

59
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,650
It's going to send me the jacket immediately.

60
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,120
And let's assume that the season package, contrary to what

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,370
we just did-- in this example, let's

62
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,560
assume that the season package retails for $750.

63
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
Now, to allocate the price here, we're

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,390
going to use the relative retail value of each component.

65
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,440
So the jacket's worth $200.

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,270
The season pass is worth $750.

67
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,700
So the performance obligation is the pass and the coat.

68
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,380
The pass has a retail value of $750, which

69
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,728
is 79% of the total value.

70
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:45,270
And then we're going to allocate that

71
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,980
to the bundle price at $800, and that gives us our sales price

72
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,980
allocation of $632.

73
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,290
Now, on this part of it, we're not

74
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,570
going to recognize the revenue now.

75
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,970
We're going to defer the revenue and recognize it

76
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,400
over the course of the next year.

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,350
The coat, on the other hand, it has a retail value of $200.

78
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,420
That's 21% of the total retail sales price,

79
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,680
or $168 of the bundle sales price,

80
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,824
and we're going to recognize that revenue now.

81
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,779


82
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,180
So again, continuing on with this example,

83
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,660
then, we're going to get cash of $800, deferred revenue, which

84
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,490
is the season pass-- we're going to defer

85
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,560
the revenue on the season pass, and we're going to recognize

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,040
regular revenue or merchandise revenue on the jacket

87
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,280
because we're delivering the jacket right away.

88
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,800
And then we'll recognize the cost of goods sold

89
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,470
associated with the jacket.

90
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,050
So essentially what we're doing here

91
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,060
is we're allocating the transaction

92
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,710
price, which is step 4 of our new revenue recognition rules.

93
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,350
And then we're recognizing revenue

94
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,480
when we satisfy the performance obligation.

95
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,240
So here, the jacket--

96
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,010
the performance obligation-- we satisfy when we deliver it.

97
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,360
The season pass, we're going to satisfy that performance

98
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,620
obligation over time.
