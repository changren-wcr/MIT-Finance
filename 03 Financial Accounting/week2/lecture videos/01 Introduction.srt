PROFESSOR: In this class, we're going

1
00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:03,540
to talk about revenue recognition, which

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,430
is very important, and we're going

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,200
to talk about allowances for bad debt and allowance for returns.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,520
Remember, last class, we talked about the accounting equations.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,490
An important one we introduced was the balance sheet equation,

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,970
which is assets equals liabilities

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,040
plus stockholders' equity.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,970
We talked about some concepts of accrual accounting.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,390
We did some balance sheet equation entries.

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,310
And in particular, we used the balance sheet equation

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,240
to do Peters Company's financial statements, their balance

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,690
sheet, their income statement, and their cash flow

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,680
for the first year of Peters' operations.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,670
In this class, we're going to finish out the Peters Company

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,070
financial statements, and then we're

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,890
going to introduce revenue recognition, how

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,810
companies recognize revenue.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,750
And then we're going to introduce allowance accounting,

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,160
how companies make estimates for the allowance for bad debt

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,490
and allowance for returns.

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,340
So remember, from last time, this is where we ended up.

22
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,920
So Peters has two performance measures

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,430
that we can look at for a year 1.

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,530
The first is net income.

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,710
They had net income of $3,000.

26
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,510
The second is cash flow from operations.

27
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,240
So they had cash flow from operations of $8,000.

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,010
And then, accruals is the difference

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,940
between net income minus cash flow from operations,

30
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,930
so accruals in their first year of operations

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,030
were minus $5,000.

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,460
Now we're going to do a year 2 of the Peters Company.

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,790
Remember in year 1, they got advance payment

34
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,210
from Julie's Company of $6,000.

35
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,880
This year, they're going to ship their remaining inventory

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,250
to Julie's Company, receive an additional $24,000.

37
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,259
They're going to pay off the accounts

38
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,340
payable for the inventory they purchased in year 1.

39
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,250
They're going to pay off their wages payable balance.

40
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,080
They're going to get full payment

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,370
on their outstanding accounts receivable.

42
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,900
Fifth, they're going to incur and pay wages of $12,000.

43
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,740
And then, the final transaction we'll look at in review

44
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,630
is that they'll pay a dividend of $9,000.
