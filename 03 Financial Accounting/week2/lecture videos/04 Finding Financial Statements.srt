JOHN CORE: So in this little segment,

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,200
we're going to talk about finding US companies'

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,590
financial statements.

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,090
So for example, we're going to use Dell's financial statements

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,010
later on in this class.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,840
So finding US companies' financial statements.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,470
There are basically two ways to do this.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,510
One is the SEC, which is the US Securities and Exchange

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,590
Commission.

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,080
It requires that all public companies

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,800
file their financial statements with the SEC.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,810
So one thing you could do is pick a company

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,950
that interests you, maybe it's Dell technology, maybe somebody

14
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:43,620
else, go to SEC EDGAR, Google that, and then find the 10K.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,550
But I encourage you very strongly, don't print the 10K,

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,190
because often these documents are several hundred pages long.

17
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,880
So nowadays, with Adobe Acrobat, you

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,950
can just search the 10K electronically.

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,510
The other way you can get a 10K or a company's annual report

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,540
is go to the company's investor relations website.

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,800
So you might Google, for example, Tesla investor

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,750
relations, if you're interested in Tesla.

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,700
So here's what it looks like if we search for Dell Technologies

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,280
10K on SEC EDGAR.

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,390
So we search EDGAR, we put in Dell Technologies,

26
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,170
we put in filing type as 10K, and then

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,380
it'll give a list of all the 10Ks that we want,

28
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,690
and then we can click through to get the document that we want.

29
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,550
Alternatively, you can go to a company's investor relations

30
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,840
website.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,120
Here, for example, is Tesla's investor relations website.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,840
And it'll also give you SEC filings.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,100
You can pick out their 10K.

34
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,810
And that 10K comes in Acrobat formats, so PDF,

35
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,960
or it comes as a Word document, and sometimes

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,380
what's really handy is you can get it in an Excel spreadsheet

37
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,780
so you can pick up all the numbers in an Excel

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,930
spreadsheet.
