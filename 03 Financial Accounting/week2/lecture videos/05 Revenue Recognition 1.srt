1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:01,470
PROFESSOR: So the main thing we're

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,050
going to talk about in the first part of this class

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,780
is revenue recognition.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,840
So remember that earnings are the difference between revenues

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,650
and expenses.

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:18,040
So revenue recognition tells us when we can recognize revenues.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,250
And then expenses are matched to revenues

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,750
by the matching principle.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,320
So revenues are really important in the sense

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,430
that it determines how much sales you have and it also

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,310
determines how much expenses you have.

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,470
So two critical issues are, when do we earn revenues

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,990
or when can we recognize the revenues?

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,930
That's going to be the first part of this class.

15
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,820
And then later on in this class, we're

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,630
going to talk about estimating how much of those revenues

17
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,740
are not going to be paid to us because they're bad debts

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,780
or how much of those revenues we're not

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,140
going to make because our customers return items.

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,810


21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,960
Now we just want to go through some examples of some revenue

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,920
transactions.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,070
So we're going to use Dell as an example.

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,160
So many of you have bought a Dell computer.

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,680
So you buy a computer over the website.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,200
Let's say, in the first transaction,

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,570
you buy a computer for $1,000.

28
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,120
You put in your credit card.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,300
So it's basically a cash transaction.

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,770
So let's think about what happens.

31
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,040
Dell's going to get cash of $1,000.

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,250
It's going to recognize $1,000 worth of revenue.

33
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,630
The computer cost $500.

34
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,290
So out of its inventory, we're going

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,400
to send out a $500 computer, and that'll

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,980
be our cost of goods sold for this transaction.

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,700
Now let's just do a slightly different transaction

38
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,350
where Dell sells the computer, and instead of getting cash,

39
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,960
it sells it on account, which means it gets

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,060
in accounts receivable for it.

41
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,430
So as you can imagine, the transaction's

42
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,480
going to look very much the same.

43
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,960
So we got an accounts receivable instead of cash.

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,970
So the customer promised to pay us $1,000 in cash.

45
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,950
We recognize revenue.

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,190
We recognize cost of goods sold.

47
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,190
Now let's do something that's a little tricky.

48
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,080
Now Dell gets $1,000 prepayment for a computer.

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,250
Does it recognize any revenue?

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,210
No, it doesn't recognize revenue because it hasn't delivered

51
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,500
the computer to the customer.

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,560
So the way that we're going to account for this

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,280
is that Dell gets $1,000 of cash,

54
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,430
and it's going to get some revenue in the future, which

55
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,960
we call deferred revenue.

56
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,060
But that's a liability right now.

57
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:56,540
Now, sometime in the future, Dell delivers this computer.

58
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,700
What do you think is going to happen then?

59
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,920
So basically, this transaction shows

60
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,610
that the deferred revenue on delivery of the computer

61
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,020
becomes regular revenue.

62
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,560
So deferred revenue is going to go away.

63
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,330
$1,000 is going to decrease deferred revenue.

64
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,770
That'll become regular revenue.

65
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,300
And then the cost of goods sold side of the transaction

66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,120
is identical.

67
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,270
Revenue recognition is very important

68
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,990
because revenue recognition determines revenue.

69
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,160
Once we recognize revenue, we recognize expenses

70
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,420
by the matching principle.

71
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,830
So revenue recognition determines revenue,

72
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,110
and it determines expenses.

73
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,360
And therefore, it determines earnings.

74
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,490
So the SEC, the US Securities and Exchange Commission,

75
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,250
keeps track of all the kind of corporate fraud

76
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,560
that companies engage in.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,360
And when they look at over a long period of time--

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,290
so basically a 32 or 33 year period of time--

79
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,260
most fraud involves misstated revenue.

80
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,470
So that's motivation for what we're going to do

81
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,430
is you need to understand how companies are recognizing

82
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,460
revenue to make sure that you have a sense

83
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,830
that they're recognizing revenue correctly.
