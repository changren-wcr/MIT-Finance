00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
PROFESSOR: Now for the BASE equation.

1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,480
so BASE means Beginning plus Additions plus Subtractions

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,860
equals Ending Balances.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,430
So every balance sheet account is

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,560
going to evolve using the same BASE equation.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,780
So we've got a beginning balance.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,320
So for example, right now it's the allowance

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,860
for doubtful account.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,390
We add stuff to it.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,780
So in our example here we're adding bad debt expense to it.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,230
We subtract things from it, so our example here we're

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,360
subtracting write-offs from the allowance

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,070
for doubtful accounts.

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,950
That gives us our ending balance.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,740
So the BASE equation beginning plus editions

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,800
minus subtractions equals ending balance,

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,170
we're going to keep using this throughout the course.

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,730
And in our example now that helps us

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,490
because the percentage of sales method

19
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,480
gives us bad debt expense, which is an addition,

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,720
and that allows us to compute the ending balance because we

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,060
know what write-offs are.

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,070
Alternatively in a minute we're going

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,250
to talk about the aging analysis, which will give us

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,850
the ending balance.

25
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,270
We still know what the subtractions are,

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,900
and then we can back into the amount of the additions, which

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,810
is bad debt expense.

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,990
Another way to see this is on this slide here

29
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,030
looking to the right on our contra

30
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,860
asset, which again is an asset account, which

31
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,070
is used to record reductions in the value of an asset.

32
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,060
So we're looking at allowance for doubtful accounts.

33
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,250
It has a beginning balance.

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,890
We add bad debt expense to that.

35
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,600
We subtract write-offs.

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,330
That gives us our ending balance.

37
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,940
At the time that we subtract those write offs

38
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,430
from the allowance for doubtful accounts,

39
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,420
we're going to reduce accounts receivable,

40
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,170
and accounts receivable evolves based on we

41
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,240
have a beginning balance.

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,850
We add some credit sales.

43
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,979
We collect cash on some of that.

44
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,500
We write some of it off, and then that

45
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,920
gives us our ending balance.

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,220
So this is the BASE equation for allowance for doubtful accounts

47
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,000
and for allows for accounts receivable.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,820
And then companies give you information

49
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,920
in this BASE format.

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,230
So for example Dell keeps track of trade receivables, which

51
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,200
is the first panel in the slide here

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,670
and customer financing receivables, which is

53
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,760
the second panel of the slide.

54
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,420
And you can find this in the 10K in scheduled two.

55
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,510
And so again, notice, the words here.

56
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,180
Balance at the beginning of a period, that's

57
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,380
basically beginning allowance for doubtful accounts.

58
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,270
Provision charge to the income statement,

59
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,290
that's what we've been calling bad debt expense.

60
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,020
Bad debt write offs, we could call

61
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,840
that amount deemed uncollectable,

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,730
and then the balance at the end of the period is ending ADA.

63
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,000
Same thing with a customer financing receivables,

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,940
they've got different words but it essentially

65
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,490
is the same concept.

66
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,580
We begin with an allowance for doubtful accounts.

67
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,220
We add bad debt expense.

68
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,680
We reduce it by write offs, and then that

69
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,200
gives us an ending allowance for doubtful accounts.
