00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
PROFESSOR: So the old revenue recognition standard

1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,830
I like a lot because it's very simple.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,740
You recognize revenue based on two tests.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,800
Number one, did you earn the revenue?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,660
Number two, can you collect the revenue from your customers?

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,090
So earned means is the earnings process substantially complete?

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,320
Have we delivered the good or service?

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,700
And if we've delivered a good, how much of that good

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,100
is going to be returned?

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,900
Collectible is just can we collect cash from our customers

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,860
on our accounts receivable?

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,300
So we sell something and get an accounts receivable.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,750
Are we going to collect that accounts receivable

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,900
from our customer?

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,310
So the old revenue standard, again,

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,370
is very nice and intuitive.

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,350
Did we earn the revenue?

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,715
Can we collect the revenue?

18
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:59,680


19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,890
Now, channel stuffing is something

20
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,470
that's very common, where companies,

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,930
because they have a fiscal year end,

22
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,570
they want to have sales moved in this year

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,160
so that they can have this year sales and profits this year

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,030
rather than waiting till next year.

25
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,230
So it has something to do with management compensation.

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:25,305
So here's a Dilbert cartoon that gives us the intuition.

27
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:27,730
In the left panel, the boss says,

28
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,450
I need everybody's help in the shipping department.

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,090
Anything we ship before the end of the month--

30
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,710
this is the center panel--

31
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,910
gets counted as revenue.

32
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,270
And then, the boss says, unfortunately,

33
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,590
we don't have anything to ship.

34
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,550
We don't have any inventory.

35
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,820
So in the final panel, he says, we'll

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,070
just ship whatever's lying around.

37
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,410
We'll book it is revenue, and we'll sort it out later.

38
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,070
So that's channel stuffing, where we're basically

39
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:59,160
trying to bring revenue into this year from next year.

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,910
So the question is, can Dilbert's company recognize

41
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,090
revenue in this example?

42
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,910
Clearly, the answer is no, so the revenue's not earned.

43
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,660
So our two tests are is it earned?

44
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,330
It is a collectible?

45
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,650
So clearly, it's not earned.

46
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,830
We haven't shipped the customer anything of value.

47
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,020
Also, it's not collectible.

48
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,690
If we invoice the customers for this stuff,

49
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,990
they won't pay for it.

50
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,530
Now a real-world example of this channel stuffing

51
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,290
was Bausch and Lomb in 1993.

52
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,620
In December of 1993, Bausch and Lomb

53
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,890
realizes that it's $15 million short of its sales budget,

54
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,710
and it's concerned about this because of it doesn't mean

55
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,490
its sales budget, profits are going to be lower,

56
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,080
and executives are not going to get

57
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,990
paid as much of their bonuses.

58
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,920
So they basically have some choices to increase revenues

59
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,050
in December of 1993.

60
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,760
First thing they could do--

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,470
and you see a lot of companies doing

62
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,930
this toward the end of their fiscal year end.

63
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,700
We could do more advertising.

64
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,920
We could do more sales promotions.

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,000
We could try to get customers to come in and buy stuff.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,720
And then, more aggressively, we can tell customers, anything

67
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,490
you by December 31, 1993, we'll give you a discount on it.

68
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,590
Now this is basically a within GAAP

69
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,120
or non-fraudulent way of channel stuffing.

70
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,140
Now, other ways we could channel stuff

71
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,970
is we get back to January revenues to December 1993.

72
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,320
What I mean by that is stuff that they came in just

73
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,560
at the start of the year in 1994,

74
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,890
we change the invoices to make it look like that stuff came

75
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,890
in December of 1993.

76
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,070
More extremely, we could just make up receipts

77
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,800
and basically make up revenues.

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,830
Now, clearly, this is unethical, and this is fraud.

79
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,710
So we have some choices.

80
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,880
We can do something within GAAP to increase sales,

81
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,320
or we can commit fraud as a way of increasing sales.

82
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,620
So what Bausch and Lomb actually did was in late December,

83
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,660
it transferred $22 million of products to its distributors.

84
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,840
And at the time of the transfer of those products,

85
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,560
it recognized $22 million in revenue.

86
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,390
And then, by the matching principle,

87
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,330
we're going to recognize $9 million in cost of goods sold.

88
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:43,060
So our profits increased $13 million in fiscal year 1993.

89
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,200
Now, let's think about our revenue recognition test.

90
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,960
Is a collectible?

91
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,930
When we ship these goods to our distributors

92
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,590
and they give us an accounts receivable for them,

93
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,020
do we reasonably expect to collect that money

94
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,850
from the distributors?

95
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,440
The answer here is yes.

96
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,420
We've never had any payment problems

97
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,300
with these distributors, so it's definitely the case

98
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,520
that we can collect this.

99
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,610
The second test is did we earn it?

100
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,930
Is the earnings process substantially complete?

101
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,810
And the key thing here is we've shipped $22 million

102
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,570
worth of products to our customers.

103
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,360
How much of that inventory, if any,

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,220
is going to be returned to us?

105
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,250
Now, after the fact, it was discovered

106
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,030
that Bausch and Lomb had side agreements allowing

107
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,630
for the products to be returned.

108
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,290
So even though they shipped $22 million of stuff

109
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,750
to their distributors, the distributors

110
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,190
could return that stuff at any point.

111
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,210
And because it did not appropriately reduce revenues

112
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,880
by the expected amount of those returns,

113
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,420
Bausch and Lomb overstated its revenues

114
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,330
and overstated its earnings.

115
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,160
And this is fraud.

116
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,000
And among other things, the CEO got fired for doing this.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,670
But this just illustrates the importance of revenue

118
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:13,040
recognition and illustrates the importance of understanding,

119
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,890
did we earn the revenue, and can we collect the revenue?
