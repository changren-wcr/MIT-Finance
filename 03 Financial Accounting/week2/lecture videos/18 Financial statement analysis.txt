00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
PROFESSOR: Now let's do a little bit of financial statement

1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,380
analysis, and I want to introduce a concept here called

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,410
accounts receivable turnover, which

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,200
is defined as how much revenue we

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,980
have divided by average accounts receivable net.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,400
So this ratio of measures how quickly we

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,540
collect cash on credit sales.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,700
So if we have lots of credit revenue but low receivables,

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,170
we'll collect cash quickly.

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,340
So on this accounts receivable turnover,

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,750
we want a bigger number.

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,570
That means that we are collecting faster.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,020
That means that we don't have so much capital tied up

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,560
in accounts receivable.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,510
I think a more intuitive way to do

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,450
it is just do the inverse of accounts receivable.

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,640
So divide accounts receivable turnover into one.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,030
Multiply it by day's receivable--

18
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,940
multiply it by 365.

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,700
That gives us days receivable.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,960
All we've done is invert accounts receivable turnover

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,900
calculation, but this gives us an intuition

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,310
of how many days of sales it takes us to collect payment

23
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,750
after a sale.

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,080
So here a smaller number is better

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,250
because it indicates faster collections.

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,450
Now looking back at our friends Bausch and Lomb.

27
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,200
In this chart, the first line is the year.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,390
So we're looking at 1990 to 1993.

29
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,680
Remember, 1993 was the year of the fraud.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,640
We look at their net sales over that four year period.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,040
We look at their net accounts receivable

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,350
over that four year period.

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,030
We average the accounts receivable.

34
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,550
So for example, in '91 I'm taking the average of 203

35
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:04,660
and 205 to get average net accounts receivable of 204.

36
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,570
And then having calculated average net accounts

37
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,030
receivable, I can compute accounts receivable turnover as

38
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,390
shown in the fifth row there.

39
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,340
And then we can infer that and multiply it by 365

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,390
and come up with days receivable.

41
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,120
So this is not a red flag, but what you see going on

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,860
there is accounts receivable turnover is about 7

43
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,760
in '91 and '91, and then it slows way down

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,210
and goes below 6 in '93.

45
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,310
Or similar intuition, days receivable is about 50

46
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:52,050
in '91 and '92, and then it shoots up to 65 in '93.

47
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,550
So this is telling you that the company is doing something

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,040
different with its accounts receivable,

49
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,360
and it may bare use for you as an analysis

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,650
to look into this more deeply just with some simple accounts

51
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,040
receivable turnover numbers.
