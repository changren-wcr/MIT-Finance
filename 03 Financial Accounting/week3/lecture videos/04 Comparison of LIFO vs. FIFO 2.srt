1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,330
INSTRUCTOR: Now to do an example to illustrate the difference

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,840
between LIFO and FIFO.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,240
And we've got a simple company.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,170
In its first year of operations, it began its operations,

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,000
it issued stock for $100 in cash.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,010
With that cash, it purchased seven tires for $8 each.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,810
Then later that year, it sold three tires for $10 each.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,300
And in its second year of business,

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,530
it purchased five tires for $10 each.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,730
And then it sold four tires for $12 each.

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,330
All of these transactions are in cash just to make it simple.

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,530


13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,650
So here's our inventory equation.

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,910
We started Year 1, we had no tires.

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,340
We bought seven tires for a total price of $56.

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,300
So the goods available for sale were seven tires,

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,300
each purchased at $8 a tire.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,180
And our Year 1 inventory was $56 available for sale.

19
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:17,050
Now in this first year, does LIFO or FIFO matter?

20
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,650
The answer is no it doesn't because all the tires

21
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,590
in inventory are either new or old

22
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,110
depending on your perspective, but they all

23
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,480
had the same price.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,110
So when we go to sell some tires,

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,740
we sell three tires at $8, so cost of goods sold is $24.

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,900
And our ending inventory is four tires at $8,

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,400
so our ending inventory is $32 worth of tires.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,250
Ending inventory this year becomes

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,650
beginning inventory next year.

30
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,460
We purchased five tires for $50.

31
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,710
And our goods available for sale is

32
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,870
a mixture of $8 tires and $10 tires

33
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,039
with a total value of $82.

34
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,400
Now when we go to sell tires, which costs are we

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,470
going to allocate to the sale.

36
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,660
Is it going to be the new tires, or is it

37
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,950
going to be the old tires?

38
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,100
This is where LIFO and FIFO comes into play.

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,800
Let's first do LIFO.

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,270
So LIFO means last in, first out.

41
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,090
So the newest tires that we bought

42
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,050
are going to be the ones that we sold.

43
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,800
So we're going to ascribe to cost of goods sold a $10 value.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,380
Our ending inventory is going to be a mixture of one new tire

45
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:53,200
and four old tires for a total ending inventory of $42.

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,370
Now let's compare that to what happens under FIFO.

47
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,120
Which tires are we going to sell under FIFO accounting?

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,720
Well, FIFO is first in, first out,

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,150
so we're going to sell the oldest tires

50
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,260
in the cost of goods sold.

51
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,320
So our cost of goods sold will be four tires at $8 a tire

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,350
or $32 in total.

53
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,860
And then our ending inventory will be more valuable.

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,000
It'll be $50 in total.
