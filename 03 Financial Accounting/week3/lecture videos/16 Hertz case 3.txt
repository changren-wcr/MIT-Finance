00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
PROFESSOR: So as review from what we did earlier

1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,630
in this class, remember gain or loss

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,210
on a sale of property, plant, and equipment

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,990
is going to equal the sales price minus the net book

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,090
value, which is gross PPE minus accumulated appreciation.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,830
Just going to rearrange this a little

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,550
bit to put accumulated depreciation up front,

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,980
and then a term which is gross PPE minus the sales price.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,240
And if you notice, the first term is accounting depreciation

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,280
and the second term is economic depreciation.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,350
So you bought the asset for the gross PPE price,

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,290
and you later sold it for the sales price.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,740
So that's economic depreciation.

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,500
So if we look back to the Zsa Zsa company example above,

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,510
I'm just to make a little table where

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,780
we vary accounting depreciation and then recompute

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,130
the gain or the loss.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,010
So notice that the first column is the sales price.

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,640
The second column is the cost.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,170
Third column is economic depreciation,

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,240
which is PPE cost minus the sales price.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,870
And what we're bearing is accounting depreciation

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:25,470
from 10.8 as in our first example down to 15.2.

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,580
And then notice that as accounting depreciation is

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,670
small, we have a loss.

25
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,070
And that's telling us that there was too little depreciation.

26
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,010
And when we go down to the bottom of the chart

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,090
we have a gain which tells us that we, sort of,

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,840
over-depreciated the asset or we depreciated the asset

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,860
in a conservative fashion so that when we sold it

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,350
accounting depreciation was bigger

31
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,470
than economic depreciation, which

32
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,160
means that we had a gain on the sale of the asset.

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:07,200
So let's look back at exhibit 14 again and notice that in 2013

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,430
in the four year period.

35
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,720
We have a gain, which is equal to accounting depreciation

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,120
minus economic depreciation.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,420
That gain implies that Hertz is actually

38
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,380
being conservative in their depreciation policy.

39
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,160
And it suggests that Hertz is not depreciating too little.

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,090
One further piece of information we can look at from the case

41
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,670
is we can compare Hertz to its big competitor, Avis Budget

42
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,420
Group.

43
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,390
Then notice that four year average

44
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,760
drops for Avis even more than it drops for Hertz.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,520
So there's something going on in the industry

46
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,140
where depreciation rates are dropping.

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,850
And this suggests that Hertz is in line with its peers,

48
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,070
and it suggests that Hertz is not, in fact,

49
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,130
cooking the books.
