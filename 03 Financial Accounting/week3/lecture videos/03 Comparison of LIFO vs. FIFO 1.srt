1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,430
PROFESSOR: Here's a giant gumball machine.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,550
Notice that you put the gumballs in on top,

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,340
and then the gumballs come out in the middle of the machine.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,220
So now we're going to talk about LIFO,

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,570
which is last in, first out, versus FIFO, which is first in,

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,770
first out.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,050
So the giant gumball machine we just looked at,

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,130
let's suppose it has 100,000 gumballs in it.

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,250
Let's suppose the gumball prices have been rising over time,

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,870
and we want to know the value of the ending inventory

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,460
of the gumballs in the machine.

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,800
So we need a cost flow assumption.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,710
One we'll look at today is LIFO, which is last in, first out.

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,230
So when you go to the grocery store,

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,680
you're going to look around for the newest milk, typically

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,230
in the back of the container, and you're

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,340
going to grab that newest milk because you want the new milk,

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,520
you want the new eggs, and the new produce.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,780
So your shopping behavior is to try to get the last in,

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,130
the newest stuff, bring it out first.

21
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,240
FIFO is the other assumption that we'll look at.

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,060
This is first in, first out.

23
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,000
This is how the grocery stores wish you would shop,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,230
so they spent a lot of time organizing the shelves so

25
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,920
that the oldest product is the first one that you would reach

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,290
if you don't reach to the back.

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,290
So depending on the cost flow assumption,

28
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,610
it's going to change how we value the inventory.

29
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,780
But notice that in practice cost flow assumption is

30
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,150
independent of physical flow.

31
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,870
So we might choose LIFO cost flow assumption

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,060
for this gumball machine, but what's

33
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,090
the physical flow of this gumball machine?

34
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,220
Gumball goes in the top of the machine

35
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,330
and then works its way down to the middle of the machine.

36
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,370
So this is first in, first out.

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,780
So lots of physical flows are first in, first out,

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,790
but for accounting purposes, we don't

39
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,789
have to recognize the physical flows.

40
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,690
We can choose to cost things however

41
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,830
way it makes more sense for us.
