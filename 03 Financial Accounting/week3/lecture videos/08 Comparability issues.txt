00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
PROFESSOR: So now we want to talk about some comparability

1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,790
issues.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,960
So as we talked about earlier, the balance sheet

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,140
and the income statement of a LIFO firm

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,250
is going to be different from a FIFO firm.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,090
First, remind ourselves why US firms use LIFO.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,700
So if you have rising costs and you report taxable income

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,690
using LIFO, that means your taxable profits

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,620
will be lower and that--

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,640
and LIFO also results in a more accurate income statement.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,450
But if a firm uses LIFO and one of its peer firms uses FIFO,

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,030
they have different accounting, so we're

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,300
going to need to adjust the accounting numbers to make them

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,590
comparable so we can analyze the two firms on an apples

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,595
to apples basis.

15
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:57,120


16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,860
And as it turned out, data is available to adjust the LIFO

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,770
firm to FIFO but we can't adjust the FIFO firm to LIFO.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,890
So what we're going to do in the next example

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,150
is to pick a LIFO firm and talk about how

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,680
to adjust that firm to FIFO so that we can compare the two

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,970
firms apples to apples.

22
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,790
Remember earlier when we did our example,

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,480
the LIFO firm had some cost layers.

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,380
It had one tire at the new price of $10,

25
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,370
and it had four tires at the old price of $8.

26
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,430
The FIFO firm, at least in our example,

27
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:46,380
only had the new tires in inventory at $10.

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,850
So if companies are using LIFO the requirement

29
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,170
is they disclose the current cost of their LIFO inventory

30
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,120
in the footnotes.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,710
So notice that $42 is less than $50,

32
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,680
so the difference between current FIFO cost of $50

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,500
and LIFO value of $42 is referred to as the LIFO

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,670
reserve.

35
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,810
And most companies will tell you the difference

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,120
between ending inventory of FIFO, so $50 in our example

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,530
here, and ending inventory in LIFO, so

38
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,920
$42 in our example here.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,440
Now let's look at a real financial statement.

40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,460
So this is ExxonMobil, the big oil company as of 2011.

41
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,460
So if you read the financial statement,

42
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,860
you see that the replacement cost of inventory,

43
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,500
so the current cost of inventory exceeds their LIFO carrying

44
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:57,600
value by $25.6 billion as of 2011.

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,910
What are these inventory values shown

46
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,780
in their financial statements?

47
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,020
These are their LIFO values.

48
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,080
So what would the 2011 FIFO value be?

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,740
It would be the $11.7 billion LIFO of value

50
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,430
plus the $25.6 billion LIFO reserve.

51
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,350
So the FIFO inventory is $37 billion.

52
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,530
So that inventory is actually worth $37 billion,

53
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,520
even though it's shown on their balance sheet

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,910
at about $12 billion.

55
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,160
Now if ExxonMobil switched to first in,

56
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,420
first out at the end of 2011, what

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,990
would happen to their taxes?

58
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,500
So this was what we were talking about a few minutes ago.

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,360
So we could reword this question as how large

60
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,000
is ExxonMobil's cumulative tax savings by using LIFO?

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,610
We're going to assume a tax rate of 30%.

62
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,950
Notice that their LIFO reserve again is $25.6 billion,

63
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,910
and that really when you think about it,

64
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,230
it represents the additional amount that ExxonMobil

65
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,680
has charged to cost of goods sold since the firm

66
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,839
began using LIFO.

67
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,880
So if it switched to FIFO, all that $25.6 billion

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,960
would come into income, and assuming that ExxonMobil

69
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,540
pays a 30% tax rate, it would pay an additional $7.7 billion

70
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,200
in taxes.

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,030
So by using LIFO, ExxonMobil has saved itself $7.7 billion

72
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,520
in taxes over time.

73
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,390


74
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,070
Now let's look at the income statement for ExxonMobil.

75
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,270
We see the cost of goods sold number in 2011

76
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:03,790
is $306.8 billion and what we want to do now

77
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:10,430
is compute ExxonMobil's cost of goods sold under FIFO.

78
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,670
And to do this we have to adjust the LIFO cost of goods

79
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,940
sold number that we just saw to a FIFO

80
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,290
cost of goods sold number.

81
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,380
I'm going to flip ahead a couple of lines

82
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,640
here, so all you need to know is the--

83
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,930
pardon the box there, which is the change in the LIFO reserve

84
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,240
is equal to the difference between cost

85
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,370
of goods sold under LIFO, and cost of goods sold under FIFO.

86
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,340
And then those of you that are interested in a little bit

87
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,120
of algebra, I'm going to show you how we came up

88
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,140
with that equation.

89
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,960
So the first equation is the inventory equation under first

90
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,320
in, first out.

91
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,310
So ending inventory under FIFO is

92
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,980
equal to beginning inventory under FIFO,

93
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,830
plus additions, minus the cost of goods sold under FIFO.

94
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:12,910
We write the same inventory equation under LIFO

95
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,420
and then we subtract them from each other.

96
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,913
Notice that the additions there cancel out

97
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:21,330
because they're going to be the same under both accounting

98
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,220
methods.

99
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,670
And notice that we've got an expression for the ending LIFO

100
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,840
reserve equals the beginning LIFO reserve

101
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,520
plus the difference in cost of goods sold.

102
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,450
And so we come back to the change in LIFO reserve

103
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,660
tells us what the difference in cost of goods sold is.

104
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,640
So the change in LIFO reserve tells us

105
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,160
difference in cost of goods sold between LIFO and FIFO.

106
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,630
So now let's apply this in ExxonMobil.

107
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,280
So we want to know the cost of goods

108
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,210
sold under FIFO for ExxonMobil, so we just rearrange

109
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,430
our equation a little bit.

110
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,760
Now we've got cost of goods sold under FIFO

111
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,730
equals cost of goods sold under LIFO,

112
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,550
minus the change in LIFO reserve.

113
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,240
Notice that we know the cost of goods sold under LIFO,

114
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,630
we know the change in LIFO reserve from above.

115
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:29,968
So the cost of goods sold under FIFO is $302.5 million.

116
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:34,650
Now, does that pass the smell test?

117
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,440
Going back to what we were doing earlier,

118
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,370
remember the cost of goods sold under LIFO

119
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,800
is going to be more than the cost of goods sold under FIFO.

120
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
