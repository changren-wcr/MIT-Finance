1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,210
INSTRUCTOR: So now let's summarize

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,240
these in the Mackenzie 2 by 2 box

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,080
and compare last in, first out cost to first in,

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,860
first out costs.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,560
So on our income statement, remember, FIFO puts old costs

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,730
on the income statement.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,370
It puts $32 of costs on the income statement.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,820
But the new costs stay on the balance sheet.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,250
So with FIFO, the older costs hit

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,700
cost of goods sold, hit current income,

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,620
but the new cost stay on our balance sheet.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,080
With LIFO, it's just the opposite.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,590
The new costs hit the cost of goods sold and become

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,750
part of income.

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,390
The old costs stay on our balance sheet.

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,300
So that's just one example.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,920
Notice that it ultimately doesn't

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,130
matter because total costs are the same

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,380
under both LIFO and FIFO.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,180
They're $82.

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,200
But what changes is how the costs are distributed

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,840
across the income statement and across the balance sheet.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,890
And this just says that this is a general phenomenon.

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,840
So FIFO puts old costs on the income statement,

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,410
new costs on the balance sheet.

26
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,900
LIFO, on the other hand, puts new costs

27
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,470
on the income statement, old costs on the balance sheet.

28
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,380
Total costs are going to be the same.

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,480
So we're just distributing cost differently

30
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,420
across the income statement and the balance sheet.

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,990
And when you think about it, the new costs

32
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,230
are the more accurate costs because they're

33
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,010
closer to replacement cost.

34
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,060
So if you went out and bought tires right now,

35
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,260
the new cost would approximate how much you would have

36
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,660
to pay for tires right now.

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,800
So FIFO gives you a more accurate balance sheet

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,930
because it has the new costs on the balance sheet,

39
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,380
whereas LIFO method of accounting

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,400
gives you a more accurate income statement because the new costs

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,190
are on the income statement.

42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:19,160
So over time, say like year two, ending inventory under LIFO

43
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,790
is going to be less than ending inventory under FIFO.

44
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,195
Now does that mean LIFO firms' inventories are less valuable?

45
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:30,570
Now when you think about it, it's

46
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,660
exactly the same thing in both inventories.

47
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,890
There's a bunch of tires in there.

48
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,290
It's just a costing method is different.

49
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,610
So the cost flow assumption is independent

50
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,140
of the physical flow.

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,560
We've got the same tires in the inventory in both cases,

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,330
but we've costed them or we've accounted for them differently.

53
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,940
Same thing on the income statement.

54
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,970
So cost of goods sold under LIFO are, in general,

55
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,550
going to be higher than cost of goods sold under FIFO.

56
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,060
That means that our gross profit under LIFO

57
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,190
is going to be lower than our gross profit under FIFO.

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,470
Now do these profit differences say

59
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,950
that there's something going on differently in terms

60
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,450
of economic performance?

61
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,400
So no, again, it's just an accounting difference.

62
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,030
Here, accounting and economics are different.

63
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,240
The economics is the same across the two firms,

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,760
we just got differences in financial reporting.
