00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300


1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,175
PROFESSOR: All right.

2
00:00:01,175 --> 00:00:03,370
So we just finished talking about inventory.

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,030
So the remaining agenda we have is to talk about

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,222
property, plant, and equipment.

5
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:09,680
And to do that, we're going to work

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,780
through the accounting for property plant and equipment,

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,600
starting in acquisition.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,140
You buy a car, you buy an airplane, you build a building.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,340
So you acquire some property, plant, and equipment.

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,590
We'll talk about what it means to depreciate that property,

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,990
plant, and equipment.

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,950
We'll talk about what happens if you change your depreciation

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,210
estimates.

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,010
And then finally, we'll talk about what

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,790
happens when, as we all do, we sell our car,

16
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,780
we sell our airplane, or we sell the building.

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,350
And then, the last part of this class

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,030
is we're going to talk about the Hertz case.

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,170
We're going to see how a rail company changes

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,640
their estimates.

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,700
We're going to talk about why those estimate changes were

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,050
because the company was trying to manipulate their earnings

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,170
or whether it was simply because the company was

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,290
changing their strategy.

25
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,440


26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,830
So let's think about how we record

27
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,540
an acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,850
Imagine a company buys a car for $20,000 in cash--

29
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,340
just balance sheet equation.

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,180
We're going to reduce cash by $20,000.

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,630
We're going to increase PP&E, or Property, Plant, and Equipment

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,940
by $20,000.

33
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,000
And when the purchase happens, that's all that happens.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,690
The cost of this fixed asset, or the cost of this PP&E,

35
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,790
doesn't enter the income statement.

36
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,310
Why not?

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,460
Well, as a review from last time,

38
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,820
we haven't used the car to generate revenues.

39
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,430
So until we use the car to generate revenues,

40
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,360
we're not going to match any expenses to the car.

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,450
When does a car enter the income statement?

42
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,370
Again, the same principle-- once it starts to generate revenues.

43
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,030
And then, what happens someday if we sell the car?

44
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,050
We're going to talk about that a little bit later in this class.

45
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,830
So to account for property, plant, and equipment,

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,700
we need to answer the following four questions.

47
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,700
What's the acquisition cost, how much

48
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,410
did we pay for the car, what's the salvage value, how much do

49
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,400
we think we can sell the car for some time in the future?

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,010
And that's how much we're going to depreciate.

51
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,730
And depreciate means, reduce in value over time.

52
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,630
And the third and fourth questions are,

53
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,510
what's the expected useful service life?

54
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,840
So how long do we plan to use the car for?

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,750
And then, what's our depreciation pattern?

56
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,870
Is it going to be straight-line or accelerated?

57
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,680
So this tells us how we're going to depreciate the asset.

58
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,130


59
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,390
So in terms of two of our estimates, useful life

60
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,780
and salvage value, let's just talk a little bit about them

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,110
because these can be a little subtle.

62
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,340
So useful life-- you buy a car.

63
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,750
It's the time period--

64
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,890
you're useful life on that car is the time period over which

65
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,560
you're going to use the car.

66
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,880
It's not necessarily the same as the physical life of the asset

67
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,150
because you might sell the car after two years

68
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,480
even though the car has got 10 years' worth or the mileage

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,260
says you can still put on it.

70
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,660
Salvage value is, given how long you

71
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,960
intend to use the car, what do you think

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,590
you can get when you sell it or dispose

73
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,590
of it, net of selling costs?

74
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,660
Now, obviously, the longer you intend

75
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,690
to use the car, in general, the less likely

76
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,560
the car is going to be worth at the time that you sell it.

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,070
So notice that both of these estimates,

78
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,760
both salvage value and useful life,

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,710
require managerial judgment.

80
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,870
So we have some estimate of how long

81
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,760
we're going to use the car.

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,010
And then, based on that estimate of how long

83
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,959
we're going to use the car, we're

84
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,980
making a forecast of how much we can sell the car for when

85
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,670
we're done using it.

86
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,640
Let's look at an example here just to fix these ideas.

87
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,020
And think about two types of car owners.

88
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,470
First type as the Sunday driver that's sort of

89
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,780
like my grandfather used to be.

90
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,690
And the second type is drive till it dies.

91
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,470
That's kind of like how I am.

92
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,450
So Sunday driver drives it 2,000 miles a year.

93
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,520
So Sunday driver just takes it out for a drive on Sunday.

94
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,190
He or she trades it in every two years.

95
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,660
So given that they intend to have a new car every two years,

96
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,270
they're going to trade it in every two years,

97
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,320
the useful life of their car is two years.

98
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,570
So they intend to use the car for two years.

99
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,530
And then, given that they're not driving it very much,

100
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,670
and they're not driving it very long, the salvage value, or how

101
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,640
much they expect to sell that car for,

102
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,750
is going to be very high.

103
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,170
On the other hand, another type of driver

104
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,700
is, drive till it dies.

105
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,520
So they drive it lots and lots and lots.

106
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,310
They drive it 20,000 miles a year.

107
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,410
They never trade it in.

108
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,510
And then some day, the car just quits working,

109
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,220
and they leave it on the side of the highway.

110
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,540
So their salvage value is zero.

111
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,550
And the useful life for that owner

112
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,280
just depends, but probably 10 or 15 years.

113
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,740
So the key thing is that salvage value and useful life

114
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,670
depend on what the user expects to do with the asset.

115
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,700
In terms of GAAP depreciation methods,

116
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,330
we're going to focus on straight-line depreciation

117
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:22,750
where the value of an asset just goes down in a linear function.

118
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,590
This is actually used by almost all US firms.

119
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,930
It's easy to calculate.

120
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,600
And it just gives you a constant allocation

121
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,140
of the cost of the asset from the balance sheet to the income

122
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,860
statement.

123
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,810
Another type of depreciation is accelerated depreciation.

124
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,890
We'll talk about this in the class on taxes.

125
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,370
So most firms, for their tax purposes,

126
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,730
use accelerated depreciation even though they

127
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,920
use straight-line depreciation for their financial reporting

128
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,780
purposes.

129
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,730
So accelerated depreciation for tax--

130
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,460
straight-line for financial reporting

131
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,330
is what we're going to focus on now.

132
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:14,280
Now, as an aside, how is accounting depreciation related

133
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,840
to economic depreciation?

134
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,560
To get this one, just think about buying a car.

135
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,130
So you buy a brand new car.

136
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,160
You buy it at the dealer, and you drive it home.

137
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,540
So if you bought a car, and it costs $100,000,

138
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,760
and you drove it home, how much is it worth

139
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,950
when you get it home?

140
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,540
So rule of thumb is that, once you've

141
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,460
driven a car home from the dealer,

142
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,320
the car's worth 25% less.

143
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,730
So economic depreciation, you have this rapid depreciation

144
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,310
in the early period of the asset's life.

145
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,770
Then, straight-line otherwise.

146
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,490
And accounting depreciation, straight-line throughout,

147
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,690
is an approximation to economic depreciation,

148
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,030
but it's not going to be 1 for 1.

149
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,870


150
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,980
So in terms of calculating depreciation expense, if we're

151
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,720
doing straight-line, which is what we'll

152
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,010
be doing in this course, is the straight-line method is just

153
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,360
acquisition cost, how much do you pay for the car,

154
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,530
minus the salvage value, how much you expect

155
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,680
to sell the car for, and then divide that

156
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,390
by the estimated useful life.

157
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,470
So we're just trying to match the asset

158
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,410
costs with the benefits over long periods of time.
