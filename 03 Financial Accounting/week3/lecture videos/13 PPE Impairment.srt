00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
PROFESSOR: So we were just talking

1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,170
about a sale of PP&E. Now, we're going

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,710
to do an example of PPE impairment.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,070
Let's suppose instead that Zsa Zsa Company does not

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,630
sell the car.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,810
She holds it another year until December 31, 2010.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,920
And let's suppose at that time, the fair value of the car

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,260
is 3,600, but we have a net book value of 6,600.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,950
So the fair value is $3,000 less than the net book value.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,770
So in this case, the company must impair, or write down,

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,180
the asset.

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,120
And it's going to do this by increasing accumulated

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,020
depreciation by $3,000.

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,930
Let's look at the balance sheet equation entry.

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:58,070
So December 31, we start off with a PP&E balance of $20,000.

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,420
We start off with accumulated depreciation of 13,400.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,740
So that's our net book value of 6,600.

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,620
When we impair the car, we're going

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,940
to increase accumulated depreciation by $3,000.

19
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,740
That's going to give us a write-off

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,100
of $3,000 in retained earnings.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,270
And that's our impairment loss.

22
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,710
And our ending balance will be $20,000 in PP&E

23
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,850
and accumulated depreciation of 16,400.

24
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,410
So notice now the net book value of the asset, or the car,

25
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,990
is $3,600 because we increased accumulated depreciation

26
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,150
by $3,000.

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,790
Notice that we increase depreciation

28
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,670
instead of reducing property, plant and equipment.

29
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,470
The reason for this is that we want

30
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,840
to keep a record of the acquisition cost

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,080
to property, plant, and equipment on our balance sheet.

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,240
So we maintain that cost by instead increasing

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,730
accumulated depreciation.

34
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,680
Warren Buffett, in the Berkshire Hathaway 2002 Annual Report,

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,730
talks about this idea that depreciation is not

36
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,540
truly an expense because it's a non-cash charge.

37
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,570
Warren Buffett says that's nonsense.

38
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,840
Depreciation is particularly unattractive

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,470
because we put the cash out front when we buy the building

40
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,220
or when we buy the asset before the asset has

41
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,500
delivered any benefits.

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,110
So another way to look at this is

43
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,540
imagine, at the beginning of a year,

44
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,030
a company paid all of its employees

45
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,550
for the next 10 years of their service,

46
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,530
the way we would do with a fixed asset with a useful life

47
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,420
of 10 years.

48
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,870
In the following nine years, compensation

49
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,600
would be a non-cash expense.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,020
But nobody's going to argue that this is just a bookkeeping

51
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,780
formality because we paid our workers for 10 years

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,440
in advance.
