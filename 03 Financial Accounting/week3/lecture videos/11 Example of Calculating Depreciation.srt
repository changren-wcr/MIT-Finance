00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,860
PROFESSOR: So now let's do an example.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,180
And here's the facts for our example.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:13,950
So January 1, 2006, Zsa Zsa Co buys a car for $20,000 in cash.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,120
Zsa Zsa plans to use the car for five years.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,350
So the useful life of the car is five years.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,770
And at the time that they buy the car,

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,730
Zsa Zsa Co estimates that the salvage value will

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,070
be 25% of the purchase price.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,369
So here's our questions.

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,100
What's the acquisition price?

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,190
We're buying the car for $20,000.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,440
What's the salvage value?

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,260
25% of $20,000 is $5,000.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,320
How much are we going to depreciate then?

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,040
The difference between $20,000 and $5,000, or $15,000.

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,380
What's our useful life?

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,220
Five years.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,110
So what's the annual depreciation expense then?

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,320
It's going to be the acquisition costs minus the salvage

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,760
value divided by the useful life, or $3,000.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,670
So now let's look at how the balance sheet

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,680
equation records depreciation expense over the asset's life.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,010
We're going to introduce a contra-asset here, which

24
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,810
is accumulated depreciation.

25
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,190
And this is very similar to the contra-asset we had.

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,870
Allowance for doubtful accounts was a contra-asset to accounts

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,500
receivable.

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,030
So we buy the car for $20,000.

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,340
Cash goes down, and property, plant, and equipment goes up.

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,250
The next year we depreciate it.

31
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,870
So we've got $3,000 of depreciation expense

32
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,280
in the right hand column there.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,710
And then we put that in the contra-asset accumulated

34
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,930
depreciation.

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,220
The next year we do the same thing, and then so

36
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:13,550
on out until the end of the asset's life as of 12/31/2010.

37
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,670
Now importantly, and we're going to come back to this point

38
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,080
again later, notice the only time that cash goes out

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,610
is when we buy the car.

40
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,790
There's no other cash transaction.

41
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,850
So depreciation is an expense.

42
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,680
But it is a non-cash expense.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,635
So it does not affect our cash flows.

44
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:36,300


45
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,050
Here's the same thing, just shown in the depreciation

46
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,130
schedule.

47
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,880
So the far right column shows depreciation expense,

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,380
five years of $3,000 a year.

49
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,660
Gross PP&E, the acquisition cost, doesn't change over time.

50
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,670
We're going to gradually accumulate more depreciation

51
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,620
in our contra-asset account so that the net PP&E,

52
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,680
or the net book value is going to go down

53
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,720
over time from $20,000 to the salvage value of $5,000.
