00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,120
PROFESSOR: Now we're just going to make a little change here.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,780
We're going to suppose that Zsa Zsa Co.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,740
decides to change the depreciation policy a year

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,210
after it buys a car 1/1/2007.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,600
So it decides, you know, I like this car.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,330
I'm going to keep it for six years rather than five years.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:22,830
OK.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,390
So I'm going to keep it an extra year.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,070
But because of the fact that I'm keeping it an extra year,

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,850
the used car market is going to be not worth as much

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,640
for the car.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,970
So we're going to reduce the salvage value to 20%.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,430
So this kind of accounting change is made prospectively.

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,130
Prospectively means look ahead.

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,690
So we're not going to adjust any old financial statements.

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,810
All we're going to do is adjust our financial statements

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,190
on a going forward basis.

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,330
So in other words, we're going to recalculate the depreciation

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,660
rate using our new estimates.

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,260
So salvage value is decreased to 20%.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,400
So that's going to drop to $4,000.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,430
Useful life was five years.

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,280
So now we're going to take it to six years.

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,850
But we've been using the car for a year

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,240
now so the remaining useful life is

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,080
the six year total useful life minus the one year

27
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,090
that we've used it or five years.

28
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,340
And then continuing on with our work

29
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,860
on this change of depreciation policy, the amount remaining

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,010
to be depreciated at the time we make

31
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:47,790
the change is gross PP&E of $20,000 minus 1 year

32
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,630
depreciation of $3,000.

33
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,510
So we got a net book value of $17,000

34
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,180
at the time we make the change.

35
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,640
Remaining useful life is five years

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,780
so our adjusted depreciation expense

37
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,120
is going to be the net book value

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,700
of $17,000 minus the new salvage value divided

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,570
by the new remaining useful life of five years.

40
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,050
And we divide that out.

41
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,170
That gives us a lower depreciation rate of $2,600.

42
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,920
So notice what happened is by stretching the useful life

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,340
and not reducing the salvage value all that much,

44
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,380
the new depreciation rate is lower than the old depreciation

45
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,090
rate.

46
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,120
And so we could sort of see that again

47
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,690
in this table where depreciation expense on the right hand

48
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,390
column drops from 3,000 a year to 2,600 a year.

49
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,320
We add an additional year of useful life to it.

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,310
So over time, we're going to accumulate depreciation

51
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:05,940
of $16,000 and depreciate the asset down to its salvage value

52
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,710
or net book value at the time of the end of the asset's

53
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,350
life of $4,000.

54
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,600
So we've done two examples now.

55
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,650
We bought the car.

56
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,040
We had an original depreciation rate.

57
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,960
We changed the depreciation rate.

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,203
We talked about what happened then.

59
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,620
Now we're going to talk about what

60
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:32,460
happens if we sell the car at the start of 2010 for $7,000.

61
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,090
So notice that at this point, the car,

62
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,700
just looking back on our prior slide,

63
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,670
the car has accumulated depreciation of 10,800.

64
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,560
And the net book value the asset is historical cost or what

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,380
we purchase it for of $20,000 minus accumulated

66
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:04,050
depreciation of 10,800 gives us a net book value of 9,200.

67
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,510
Now what happens when we sell the car for $7,000?

68
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,260
So we're going to go through a calculation

69
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,890
on the next couple of slides.

70
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,890
So computing a gain or loss on the sale--

71
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,320
so sometimes you sell an asset.

72
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,460
Sometimes you dispose of an asset.

73
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,000
So if you're like the drive until it drops guy,

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,300
he doesn't have a positive value for his car

75
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,850
because he driven it to such an extent

76
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,220
that he's got to call a tow truck to pick it up.

77
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,820
And so when he disposes of it, he's

78
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,710
going to actually get negative value for it.

79
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,030
But in general, you're going to sell the asset.

80
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,650
And we have a four step process.

81
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,790
First of all, keep track of cash or keep

82
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,250
track of the market value of another asset

83
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,260
if you traded something for the property, plan, and equipment.

84
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,450
So the second step is record the disposal of the asset

85
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,320
by taking the cost of the asset off the balance sheet

86
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,170
then take the accumulated depreciation off the balance

87
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,070
sheet.

88
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,890
And then we're going to solve for the gain or the loss

89
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,880
as how much cash we got or what the sales price was

90
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,930
minus the net book value.

91
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,280
And that gives us our gain or loss.

92
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,410
So in terms of the balance sheet equation,

93
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,720
remember as of 12/31/2009, we had gross property, plant,

94
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,100
and equipment of $20,000, accumulated

95
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,770
depreciation of 10,800.

96
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,680
When we sell the car, step one, keep track of cash.

97
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,060
So that's pretty easy to do.

98
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,890
So we got $7,000 worth of cash.

99
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,570
Step two.

100
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,960
Remove the PP&E from the balance sheet.

101
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,550
So we no longer own the car so we're

102
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,960
going to take it off our balance sheet.

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,570
Step three.

104
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,970
Remove the accumulated depreciation

105
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,020
from the balance sheet.

106
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,590
Again, we no longer own the car so we no longer have

107
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,350
any accumulated depreciation.

108
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,460
And then solve for the gain or the loss on the transaction.

109
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,320
This transaction we're getting $7,000 for something that

110
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,350
has a net book value of 9,200.

111
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:28,550
So our loss on the transaction is $2,200.

112
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,760
So first solve for the cash.

113
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,220
Second and third, remove the net book value

114
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,720
of the asset of $9,200 and then solve for the gain or the loss

115
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,080
on the transaction.
