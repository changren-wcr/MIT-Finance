00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,750
PROFESSOR: This section deals with PPE, property, plant,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,060
and equipment, and depreciation.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,170
Property plant and equipment, or PP&E, or PPE,

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,400
is located under assets, and is categorized as fixed assets.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,910


6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,370
There are two main aspects of PP&E,

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,880
capitalisation and depreciation.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,870
PP&E is put on the balance sheet and is capitalized,

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,360
because PP&E is believed to serve

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,549
to generate future revenues.

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,710
As firms realize benefits from PP&E, the part of cost of PP&E

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,260
is transferred over time from the balance sheet

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,770
to income statement via depreciation expense.

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,090
Therefore, depreciation is consistent with the matching

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,850
principles.

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,150
Calculating the ending PP&E balance and accumulated

17
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,430
depreciation is somewhat similar to what

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,980
we have seen for calculating ending inventory.

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,910
First, we start with the beginning balance of PP&E,

20
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,350
then we add capital expenditures,

21
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,340
which is the gross amount of PP&E purchased.

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,965
If a firm bought machinery for $1 million,

23
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:17,090
this is considered as a capital expenditure.

24
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,310
We subsequently subtract the gross value

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,220
of assets disposed or sold.

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,560
If a firm sold the building that they had,

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,140
we subtract the gross value here.

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,760
Gross value, meaning the value not considering depreciation.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,000
We arrive at the ending balance.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,940
The ending balances is basically the capitalized cost

31
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,800
of PP&E purchase.

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,380
The ending balance here assumes that there's

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,440
no impairment of PP&E. We'll get to what

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,720
this means in a few slides.

35
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,980
We also need to calculate accumulated depreciation, which

36
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,490
is a contra asset account, to derive the net PP&E value.

37
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,590
Recall that a contra asset account

38
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,890
is used to record reduction in the value of an asset.

39
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,560
Accumulated depreciation is depreciation

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,420
of an asset accumulated over the life of an asset.

41
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,060
To calculate accumulated depreciation,

42
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,010
again, we start with the beginning balance

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,360
of accumulated depreciation.

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,550
We then add depreciation expense to the beginning balance.

45
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,250
Next, we subtract accumulated depreciation

46
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,590
of disposed assets, if there are any.

47
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,970
We will have the ending balance.

48
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,020
How do we then estimate the depreciation expense.

49
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,890
The most commonly used method is the straight-line method.

50
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,880
Using this method, an asset is depreciated evenly

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,650
over an expected life.

52
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,140
Depreciation expense per year is calculated

53
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,000
as acquisition cost minus the salvage value, divided

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,430
by estimated useful life.

55
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,210
Let's go over one by one what each term means.

56
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:04,500
First, acquisition cost is the same as gross PP&E purchased.

57
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,570
If you bought a car for $50,000, then your acquisition cost

58
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,860
is exactly that amount.

59
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,850
Second, salvage value is the expected realizable value

60
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,920
of an asset at the end of useful life.

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,160
When you use your car up and take it to a car scrap,

62
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,970
how much would you receive?

63
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,030
The term acquisition cost minus the salvage value

64
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,460
is called the depreciation base, i.e.

65
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,400
the portion of the cost that is depreciated.

66
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Finally, estimated useful life is the period

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,190
over which the asset is expected to provide

68
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,590
economic benefits to the firm.

69
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,860
Know that this is not the same as physical life.

70
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,020
After calculating depreciation expense,

71
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,640
what financial statements are affected by depreciation then.

72
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,950
First, income statement is affected.

73
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,050
In particular, depreciation expense

74
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,910
increases by the expensed amount,

75
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,110
so that net income will decrease.

76
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,850
How about the balance sheet?

77
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,090
Accumulated depreciation, which is a contra asset account,

78
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,330
will increase by the depreciation expense amount.

79
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,700
Will statement of cash flows be affected?

80
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,540
Think about whether depreciation expense affects cash flows.

81
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,510
Since depreciation does not involve any cash inflow

82
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,820
or outflow, depreciation will not

83
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,080
have any effect on statement of cash flows.
