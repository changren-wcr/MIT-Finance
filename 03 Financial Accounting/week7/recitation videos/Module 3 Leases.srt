1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,300
PROFESSOR: This section deals with leases.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,800
What are leases?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,850
Leases or whatever the lessee rents from the lessor.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,760
In this recitation, we are interested in accounting

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,950
for lessee's side of transaction.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,900
There are two types of leases--

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,330
finance and operating leases.

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,300
The accounting for these two methods is different.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,610
Let's first look at finance leases.

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,670
Finance leases have the same accounting rules as before.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,800
It's just that the terminology changed from capital lease

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,570
to finance at lease recently.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,280
Here's an example.

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,250
Suppose the lease consists of 10 annual payments of $25,000,

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,280
with an interest rate of 5%.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,290
At the time of acquisition, how much

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,390
do we recognize as assets or liabilities?

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,310
To record the value of the financial squeeze

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,860
on the balance sheet, we need to calculate the sum

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,540
of present values of the lease.

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,480
We can do this by either calculating the present value

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,620
directly, as in the first table, or by linking up

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,280
the present value annuity table, like the second one.

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,880
Whatever the method you use, the present value of the lease

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,830
is approximately $193,000.

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,450
To report this on the balance sheet,

27
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,870
we first increased the item lease assets

28
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,460
by the present value of the lease, $193,000, and also

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,060
the lease obligation on that account under liabilities

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,640
by the same amount.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,990
The previous slide showed how to account

32
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,000
for leases at inception.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,720
What happens as the time passes and the lease progresses?

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,180
In the following periods, we need to book two things--

35
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,320
one, the amortization of the lease asset, and two,

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,140
lease payment covers interest expense and repays

37
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,420
part of the obligation.

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,190
Calculating amortization expenses simple.

39
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,280
You simply take the lease obligation

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,010
and divide it by the lease contract period.

41
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,030
In this case, divide $193,000 by 10 years,

42
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,930
which yields 19.3 thousand dollars for annual amortization

43
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,860
expense.

44
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,440
Calculating interest expense is similar to the method

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,290
you have seen for calculating interest expense for discount

46
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,650
or premium bonds.

47
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,560
The interest expense is remaining lease obligation

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,390
times the interest rate.

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,010
In year 1, the remaining obligation is $193,000.

50
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,400
And multiplying that by 5%, the interest rate

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,870
gives $9,650 of interest expense.

52
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,770
Notice that we paid $25,000 in cash in reality for the lease.

53
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,010
The difference of $15,350 decreases the lease obligation.

54
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,960
In the second year, the amortization

55
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,290
stays the same as 19.3 thousand.

56
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,630
To calculate the interest expense,

57
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,160
we obtained the remaining lease obligation,

58
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,670
which is $193,000 minus $15,350, which we reduced the lease

59
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,390
obligation, and multiply that by 5%.

60
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,360
This yields interest expense of $8,880.

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,770
Again cash decreases by $25,000, and lease obligations

62
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:24,290
will decrease by $16,120 to balance the equation out.

63
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,440
After the second year, the in tuition for accounting finance

64
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,610
leases is that we pay a fixed amount every year of $25,000.

65
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,560
And part of the payment is interest expense,

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,880
which is calculated as a percentage of remaining

67
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,780
obligation.

68
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,640
And the rest of the payment is paying back

69
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,710
the lease obligation.

70
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,470
Remember, interest is only paid on the remaining lease

71
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,850
obligation.

72
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,290
As lease obligation decreases, interest expense decreases

73
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,350
and a larger fraction of payment goes towards paying down

74
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,140
the principal.

75
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,210
What about operating leases?

76
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,180
Although in the past, accounting for operating leases

77
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,000
was straightforward, recent rule changes

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,420
have made operating leases accounting trickier.

79
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,200
First, at inception, record assets and liabilities as you

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,380
did with the finance lease.

81
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,540
Thereafter, there are two differences

82
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,100
from the finance lease.

83
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,270
First, rerecords lease expense, which is the direct cash

84
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,880
payments you make each year.

85
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,010
Second, the asset value is different.

86
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,240
Instead of amortizing the lease asset,

87
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,900
we reduce the value of the asset by the same amount

88
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,760
we reduce the liability.

89
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,740
Returning to the previous example,

90
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,780
and let's assume that this time the lease

91
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,930
is classified as an operating lease, not financing lease.

92
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,900
The BSE at inception is exactly the same

93
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,950
as the one you've seen for the finance lease.

94
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,940
After the first year, how do we account for operating leases?

95
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,090
For operating leases, there's no amortization expense.

96
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,450
Instead, you have a less expensive $25,000,

97
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,440
which can be directly matched to cash payment of $25,000.

98
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,680
In addition, although there's no interest expense,

99
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,320
there's something related to that.

100
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,540
The lease assets and lease obligations

101
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,750
are deducted each year, using this interest expense.

102
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,230
The amount reducing these assets and lease obligations

103
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,730
is calculated as follows.

104
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,270
First, we obtain the interest expense,

105
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,030
as we would for finance lease.

106
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,490
Then from the finance lease, $25,000,

107
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,190
which is a straight line expense,

108
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,350
we subtract the interest expense, which

109
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,190
is $9,650 in this example.

110
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,420
The remaining amount is $15,350, which

111
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,170
is deemed to be the amount to reduce lease obligations.

112
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,720
We reduce lease assets and lease obligations

113
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,710
at the same time by this amount.

114
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,410
In the second year, the process is similar.

115
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,220
Lease expense stays the same, at $25,000.

116
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,500
Then we again obtain the interest expense,

117
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,490
which is $193,000 minus $15,350, which is the lease obligations

118
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,290
amount reduced last year, and multiply that by 5%.

119
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,740
The interest expense is $8,880.

120
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,810
To calculate the amount paid back,

121
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,630
we subtract interest expense from the straight line

122
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:34,160
expense, which is $25,000, minus $8,080, equals $16,120.

123
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,500
Again, this will reduce lease obligations and lease assets

124
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,750
simultaneously.
