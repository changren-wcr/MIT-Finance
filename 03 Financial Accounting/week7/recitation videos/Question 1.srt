00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,000
PROFESSOR: Question 1-- referred to the following footnotes

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,850
for Transocean Limited on debt.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,860
Part A-- as of December 31, 2010,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,170
has Transocean redeemed any of the 7.45% nodes?

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,820
If yes, how much?

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,270
The answer is no, since the principal amount on December

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,460
31, 2010 is same as the issuing amount, which is $100 billion.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,140
You can find this in the second paragraph of the Footnotes

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,400
section.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,060
Part B-- as of December 31, 2010,

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,750
how much is the discount on the 7.45% nodes?

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,540
Is the yearly amortization of the discount

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,420
likely to be a material amount?

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,330
Hint, note 11 reports annual debt totals,

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,690
net of unamortized discounts.

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,960
The discount on the 7.45% nodes is $4 million,

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,360
which is $100 million of principal minus $96 million

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,920
on the net balance.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,700
You can find in this section of the footnotes.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,240
The yearly amortization is unlikely to be material.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,340
The rounded value of the net obligation

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,600
didn't change, indicating that the change was less than $1

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,730
million.

24
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,430
Part C-- were the 7.375% 10 year notes issued at a premium,

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,110
at a discount, or at par?

26
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,030
They were issued at a premium.

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,950
The balance of the loan, including

28
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,060
the unamortized premium, is $247 million,

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,940
which is greater than the principal amount, which

30
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,320
is to $246 million.

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,190
The second row of the table in the footnotes

32
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,460
shows the amount of the balance of the loan.

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,380
And the second paragraph indicates

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,760
$247 million principle amount.
