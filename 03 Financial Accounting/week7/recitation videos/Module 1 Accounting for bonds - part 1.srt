00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,240
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,050
Welcome to the seventh recitation of the Financial

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,730
Accounting course.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,180
In this recitation, we'll cover bonds and long term debt

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,980
and leases.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,340
Before we get into any of the details of bond accounting,

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,920
let's familiarize with the terminology

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,480
commonly used in bonds.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,840
First, par value, or face value, is the amount

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,230
that is returned to the investor when the bond materials.

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,340
For example, if a bond is bought at issuance for $1,000,

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,460
the investment bought the bond at its par value.

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,380
At the maturity date, the investor

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,870
will get back the $1,000.

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,630
Maturity of a bond is the length of time

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,810
until the bond comes due and the bondholder receives

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,060
the par value of the bond.

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,070
It is the date the firm must repay

19
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,690
the investors their principal.

20
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,360
Coupon rate, or coupon interest rate,

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,940
is the interest rate that the issuer of the bond

22
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,310
promises to pay the bond holder.

23
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,820
The coupon rate is used to determine the periodic cash

24
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,520
payments, if there is one.

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,230
There are three interest rates that are

26
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,760
relevant to bond accounting.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,520
First the coupon rate, which I talked about

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,960
in the previous slide.

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,510
It's the interest rate stated in the bond.

30
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,210
The periodic cash payments made to investors

31
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,690
will be the coupon rate times the par value of the bond.

32
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,050
Coupon payments are typically semi-annual.

33
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,650
The second is the market interest rate at issuance.

34
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,780
This is the rate that determines the interest

35
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,140
expense and the book value of the liability at issuance.

36
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,540
This is also known as the effective interest rate.

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,010
Note that this rate is fixed at the time of issuance.

38
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,010
The third rate is the market interest rate

39
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,690
in the current period.

40
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,970
This is the rate that determines the current market

41
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,260
value of the bond.

42
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,200
And this rate is based upon market conditions and risk

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,240
characteristics of the borrower.

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,100
Note that this rate fluctuates over time.

45
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,120
Largely, there are three cases for bond accounting.

46
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,760
First, there are bonds issued at par, where the market

47
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,190
rate equals the coupon rate.

48
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,440
Second, there are zero coupon bonds,

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,889
which have no coupon payment and a repayment

50
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,350
only due at maturity.

51
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,390
Please see the class video for accounting

52
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,110
for these two types of bonds.

53
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,160
The type of bonds I plan to focus on in this recitation

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,730
is bonds issued at discount or premium.

55
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,070
Discount bonds are bonds where the coupon rate

56
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,350
is lower than the market rate.

57
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,370
Premium bonds are the exact opposite, where the coupon rate

58
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,030
is higher than the market rate.
