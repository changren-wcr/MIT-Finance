PROFESSOR: Question 3, capitalizing

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,570
off balance sheet items--

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,189
refer to Zoltan Corp's off balance sheet obligations.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,380
For this question, assumes 0% tax rate.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,219
Describe how Zoltan's assets and liabilities on December 31,

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,580
2011 would change if off balance sheet

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,250
obligations are capitalized.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,580
Use the BSE to record this transaction.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,970
For this question, assume that the discount rate is 6%,

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,220
and assume that Zoltan pays the payments

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,560
at the end of the fiscal year.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,100
Also, assume that Zoltan makes equal payments over a nine year

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,060
period.

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,600
Off balance sheet obligations are $600,000 per year,

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,570
and we use discount rate of 6%.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,820
As you can see in the table on the right,

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,220
after summing up the discount values,

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,100
the present value of the off balance sheet

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,610
is approximately $4.081 million.

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:01,760
The easy way to calculate this is to use the annuity table.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,470
To do the balance sheet equation,

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,980
we increase assets by $4.081 million

23
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,210
and liabilities by the same amount.
