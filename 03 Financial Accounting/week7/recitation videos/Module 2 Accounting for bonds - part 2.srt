1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,780
PROFESSOR: Let's first look at bonds at a discount.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,330
Here, coupon rate is lower than the market rate.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,430
Suppose the face value of the discount bond is $10,000.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,050
Coupon rate is 6%, and market rate is 8%.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,840
Maturity is 3 years.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,450
Looking at the actual cash flow at the present value

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,570
of each cash flow, in years 1 and 2,

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,470
the cash outflow is $600, reflecting the coupon rate.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,910
And in year 3, cash outflow is $10,600,

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,820
because the firm needs to pay back the principal.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,000
It's the sum of year 3's interest payment

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,690
and the principal amount due at maturity.

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,330
In order to account for the schedule of payments,

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,810
we need to first calculate the present value of the bonds

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,070
each year.

16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,800
To calculate the present value, the cash flows

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,390
can be seen as $600 annually for three years at 8% market

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,830
rate for the coupon payments and $10,000 single sum in three

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,450
years at a market rate, for the principal repayment.

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,070
To calculate the present value, we

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,320
can refer to the present value tables.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,600
For the coupon payments, or the annuity,

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,270
we multiply $600 by 2.577, which is the present value

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,950
multiplier for 8% interest with a maturity of 3 years,

25
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,720
and obtain a present value of $1,546.

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,930
For the lump sum payment at year 3, we multiply 0.794 by $10,000

27
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,960
and obtain a present value of $7,938.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,160
Adding these to, annuity and single sum, the total NPV

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,670
of cash flows is $9,484.

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,620
Now on to the balance sheet equation.

31
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,410
First, at the time of issuance, the present value

32
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:56,570
of the bond, $9,484, is added as cash.

33
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,180
Bond payable increases by $10,000, which

34
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,640
is the phase value of the bond.

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,760
Simultaneously, to balance the equation out,

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,990
a cash liability account, which is called a bond discount,

37
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,850
decreases by $516.

38
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,690
So the net bond payable at this point

39
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,650
is the present value of the bond, $9,484,

40
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,860
and the discount balance is $516.

41
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,440
In year one cash decreases by $600

42
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,810
because interest is paid by the coupon rate.

43
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,680
But one thing that's tricky here is that the interest expense

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,990
is not simply $600.

45
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,900
Rather, it is the previous year's bond payable

46
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,910
times the market rate.

47
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,730
In this case, interest expense is the net bond

48
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,410
payable for year 0, $9,484, times 8%, which equals $759.

49
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,580
Therefore, retained earnings decreased by $759.

50
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,220
To balance the equation out, bond discount

51
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,270
decreases by the remaining amount, $159.

52
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,170
Now the net bond payable is last year's net bond payable

53
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,260
plus the decrease bond discount amount, which

54
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:15,030
is $9,484 plus $159, $9,643.

55
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,010
Interest payments four years two and three

56
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,770
proceed using the same method.

57
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:27,990
In year two, interest expense is $9,643 times 8%, so $771.

58
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,610
In year three, interest expense is $786.

59
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,730
At maturity date, three years after the bond issuance,

60
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,610
the net bond payable, should be $10,000.

61
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,520
Finally, accounting for the principal repayment at maturity

62
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,570
a simple.

63
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,320
Cash decreases by $10,000, the face value,

64
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,380
and bond payable decreases by $10,000.

65
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,810
Now let's take a look at bonds at premium.

66
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,790
Again, the face value is $10,000,

67
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,560
and maturity is 3 years.

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,780
But this time, the coupon rate is 8%,

69
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,180
and the market rate is 6%.

70
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,190
Using the same present value calculation method,

71
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,920
the present value at the time of issuance is $10,535.

72
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,310
Accounting for premium bonds is similar to accounting

73
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,660
for discount bonds.

74
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,540
At issuance, cash increases by the present value

75
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,110
of the bond, $10,535.

76
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,430
Bond payable increases by the face value amount, $10,000.

77
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,140
Instead of bond discount, bond premium account,

78
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,220
which is liabilities, increases by the difference

79
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,110
between cash received and the face value of the bond.

80
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,600
Net bond payable is now $10,535, and the premium balance

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,910
is $535.

82
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,550
In year 1, cash decreases by $800,

83
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,380
due to the interest payment.

84
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,210
Again, interest expense decreases

85
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,180
by the net bond payable amount in the last year

86
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,530
times the market rate, which is $632 in this case.

87
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,040
Bond premium decreases by the difference between cash

88
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,310
and the interest expense.

89
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,770
Years 2 and 3 followed the same routine.

90
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,720
Finally, at the end of maturity, cash decreases by $10,000,

91
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,680
and bond payable also decreases by $10,000,

92
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,250
once the firm repays the principal.

93
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,740
Another possible scenario to look for

94
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,160
is when firms retire debt earlier than its maturity.

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,190
When firms retire debt early, the market value of debt

96
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,980
can be different from the book value, due to the firm's

97
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,310
economic conditions, which determines the credit quality,

98
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,400
and due to macroeconomic conditions, which determines

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,350
the market interest rates.

100
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,000
A rule of thumb to remember what is actually

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,880
when market value is higher than the book

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,290
value, early retirement results in a loss, and in a gain

103
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,510
when market value is lower than the book value.

104
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,430
Let's go over an example.

105
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,250
Suppose we have a zero coupon bond

106
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,220
on our books with the following balances,

107
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,410
bond payable of $11,500 and bond discount of $1,500.

108
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,890
So the net book value is $10,000.

109
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,990
Now let's say we repurchased the bond

110
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,110
at the market value of $8,500.

111
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,440
The market rate increased.

112
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,460
So the value of that decreased, essentially.

113
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,610
To account for this, let's first look at cash.

114
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,960
Cash decreased by $8,500, because we repurchased the bond

115
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,650
at that amount.

116
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,450
Since we retired the entire amount of debt,

117
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,060
payable decreases by $11,500, and bond discount

118
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,030
is also decreased by $1,500.

119
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,780
To balance the equation how, we record an increase of $1,500 in

120
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,350
retained earnings as a gain.
