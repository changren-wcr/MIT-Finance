PROFESSOR: Question 2 uses the footnotes from Dollar General.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,080
Part A-- using the BSE, show the transaction

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,440
for dollar general's issuance of 11.875%

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,079
senior subordinated notes here after senior subordinated notes

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,030
in 2007.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,270
For this question, ignore the issuance of the senior notes

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,590
and only focus on the senior subordinated notes.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,590
Refer to the footnotes below.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,440
On July 6, 2007, Dollar General issued $725 million face value

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,500
bonds, with a maturity of 10 years.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,950
It received proceeds of $718 million

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,640
after deducting issuance costs of $7 million.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,490
To reflect this on the balance sheet equation,

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,730
cash increases by $718 million.

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,810
Deferred insurance costs increases by $7 million,

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:01,570
and bonds payable increases by $725 million.

17
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,030
Part B-- use the balance sheet equation

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,870
to identify the transactions Dollar General records

19
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,440
to reflect the issuance of the zero coupon bond.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,560
The face value of this bond is $800,000,

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,840
and this bond is a zero coupon bond

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,830
with the maturity of 20 years and a 6% interest rate.

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,580
After discounting the 20 years, the present value

24
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,460
of the $800,000 bond is $249,444.

25
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,500
Thus cash increases by $249,444.

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,740
Bonds payable increases by $100,000.

27
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,670
And bond discount, which is a contra liability account,

28
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,640
increases by $550,556, which is the difference

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,920
between the bonds payable and cash increased.

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,990
Part C-- use the balance sheet equation

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,480
to record the annual amortization related

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,260
to the zero coupon bond issued in question 2b

33
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,750
for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2012 and 2013.

34
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,510
Recall that the net bond payable at issuance is to $49,444.

35
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,680
To obtain the amortization, or the decrease in bond discount,

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,590
you take the net bond payable from last year

37
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,750
and multiply that by the interest

38
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:33,290
rate, which is to $49,444 times 6%, which equals $14,967.

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:40,700
In 2012, therefore, bond discount increases by $14,967,

40
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,030
and retained earnings also decrease by the same amount,

41
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,380
as interest expense.

42
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,235
Similarly, for year 2013, the interest expense

43
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:59,970
is net bond payable of $249,444 plus $14,967 times 6%, which

44
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,640
is $15,860.

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,070
Bond discount and shareholders' equity

46
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,500
both decrease by $15,864.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,000
