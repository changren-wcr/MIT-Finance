INSTRUCTOR: And the way this works out

1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,830
in a financial statement disclosures,

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,550
if we assume that it was Delta's only lease

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,590
and we thought about how their footnote would

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,310
look at the end of year eight, so after eight years,

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,195
we've made eight payments, there are 22 payments left.

6
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:22,460


7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,070
The least footnote will show us the next five

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,860
years of actual payments, and then it'll

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,630
show a thereafter, which is the actual payments not shown,

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,850
times 17 remaining payments.

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,550


12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,130
And that gives us our 22 payments.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:48,800
Total lease payments is 22 times 21, 795.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,500
The present value amount would be

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:59,540
21, 795 times an annuity of 22 years at a 6% discount rate.

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,240
The amounts representing interest

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,580
are just the total lease payments

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,910
minus the present value of the lease payments.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:12,110
And then this is how it looks like in Delta's actual 2018

20
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,950
financial statements.

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,970
So they show their operating leases

22
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,960
in the second to the right column, and their finance

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,540
leases in the far right column, they

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,930
show five years of payments for each.

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,800
Thereafter is the remaining payments in total,

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,250
they show you the total minimum lease payments,

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,130
they show you the present value of those minimum lease

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,820
payments, and the difference between the total

29
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,290
and the present value or the amounts representing interest.

30
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,890
Also here they show how much of these are current obligations,

31
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,620
so how much is delta going to pay within the next year,

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,500
and the remainder of it is long-term obligations.
