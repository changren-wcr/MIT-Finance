00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,440
Now let's just think about why a company would lease.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,320
And you can sort think, also, why would you--

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,160
so why would a company that's buying a building

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,390
or buying a piece of equipment, the company can take out a loan

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,050
and buy this building or buy this piece of equipment,

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,910
or it can lease.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,310
It's also helpful to think about you're

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,560
thinking about buying a car.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,280
You can buy the car using a loan,

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,125
or you can buy the car using a lease.

11
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:36,720
So most of these add advantages and disadvantages for a company

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,730
are the same as for you as an individual.

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,840
So here's a little chart that compares them.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,750
Number 1 is you buy with a loan, number 2 is when you lease.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,810
Now, when you think about if you buy a car, you own that car.

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,720
If you lease a car, who owns the car?

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,030
So if you lease a car, the dealer

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,080
or whoever is leasing the car still owns the car.

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,610
So if you don't pay your loan payment

20
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,540
or you don't pay your lease payment,

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:20,410
what is easier to repossess, a loaned car or a leased car?

22
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,130
So a leased car, you don't own it, so it's easier for somebody

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,110
to repossess it.

24
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,650
Legally, it's going to be more difficult to repossess

25
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,570
an owned car.

26
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,730
So that intuition tells you that when a company sells

27
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,850
you a car and loans you money, it

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,170
takes more risk, because you own the car,

29
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,540
than if you leased the car, because it's easier

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,940
to repossess the car.

31
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,360
Since there's more credit risk with a loan,

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,180
a bigger down payment is required.

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,770
Same thing with corporations.

34
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,980
So higher credit quality is necessary for buying

35
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,390
with a loan.

36
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,770
Lower credit quality is necessary for obtaining

37
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,980
an asset with a lease, again, because it's easier

38
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,480
to repossess.

39
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,140
So you can give an asset to a lower quality credit

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,080
if you lease it, because you know that you can repossess

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,600
that asset if things go bad.

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,540
Ownership, on the other hand, is less flexible.

43
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,440
If you get tired of your car and you own it,

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,730
you have to sell it.

45
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,990
But if you get tired of your car,

46
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,440
you can often turn it back into the lessor.

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,850
In terms of taxes--

48
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,220
and this applies only to companies--

49
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,520
so if you buy a car, as we talked about with Hertz,

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,490
you get a depreciation tax deduction,

51
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,660
but that's only if you have taxable income, whereas if you

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,540
lease the car, most of the lessors

53
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,440
are high tax finance companies, so they always

54
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,170
get the depreciation tax deduction

55
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,160
and they sometimes share that back with the lessee.

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,180
The accounting treatment, in terms of buying with debt,

57
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,400
we talked about earlier.

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,860
And in terms of buying with lease,

59
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,690
that's what we're going to do in the rest of the class now.
