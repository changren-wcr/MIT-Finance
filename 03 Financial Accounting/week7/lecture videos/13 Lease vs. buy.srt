1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,960
PROFESSOR: So leases, a lease is an agreement

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,300
that you have the right to use property, plant,

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,420
and equipment for some period of time,

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,210
usually a year or more, OK?

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,960
So the owner is the lessor.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,475
The renter is the lessee.

7
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:22,160


8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,990
And there's two questions.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,760
One is, is there an economic difference

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,740
between leasing equipment versus buying equipment?

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,470
And the second is what we were more concerned

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,460
about, is what should be the accounting for leases?

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,620
So let's think about the economics.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,250
Imagine that you rent a Zipcar for a day.

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,530
So clearly, you rent that car.

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,220
If you rent a Zipcar for a month, you're still renting,

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,750
but you get control over the asset for a month.

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,800
If you take a three-year lease, you're still renting,

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,070
but you have control over that asset for three years.

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,690
If you take a three-year lease with a purchase option,

21
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,240
you have total control of that asset,

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,170
because you can buy the asset at the end of the lease.

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,320
So it's pushing you closer to ownership.

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,530
And then finally, if I give you a five-year lease

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,570
with a bargain purchase option, so

26
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,040
at the end of the lease you can buy the car for, say, like $1,

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,920
then that lease is effectively the same as ownership.

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,910
So the way the accounting works is

29
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:39,050
for rental leases, where most of the asset

30
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,220
is rented we'll call those operating leases.

31
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,330
And when the lessee essentially owns the asset

32
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,380
or owns the property, we'll call those finance leases.

33
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,810
Now we're going to start working through the accounting

34
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,990
for finance lease.

35
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,210
Now, there's a set of accounting criteria

36
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,330
that you look at to determine whether something's a finance

37
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,440
lease or an operating lease.

38
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,190
And this is not something you need to know,

39
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,280
but it's useful to know the intuition.

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,160
So if the lessee gets almost all of the economic value out

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,550
of the asset, then it's a finance lease.

42
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,140
On the other hand, if the lessee has to give the asset back

43
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,200
when there's a lot of the useful life of the asset left,

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,280
then it's an operating lease.

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,790
So the two things are rather the best intuition.

46
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,590
So if the lease term is most of the economic life of the asset,

47
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,820
it's a finance lease.

48
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,380
If the present value of the payments under the lease

49
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,545
equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying assets,

50
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:47,920
so if we bought the asset today and it was a car,

51
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,110
we pay $50,000 but the present value of our lease payments

52
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,160
is over $50,000, then that's a finance lease.
