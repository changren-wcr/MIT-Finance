1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,880
PROFESSOR: All right, so now we know the accounting for bonds.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,700
We know what happens if we repurchase the bonds.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,530
Now let's see how bonds appear on our financial statement

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,290
or their financial statement presentation.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,120
Our balance sheet is going to have

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,930
long-term debt due in the next 12 months

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,970
as a current liability.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,070
The remainder of long-term debt and non-current liabilities.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,080
We're going to have interest expense.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,660
That's going to appear on our income statement.

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,890
On our cash flow statement, if we have a zero coupon bond,

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,790
we have interest expense, but we're not

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,080
paying any cash out for that.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,160
So remember from our discussions of cash flows,

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,900
we're going to add these interest

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,550
accruals back to net income to get cash flows.

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,690
We're going to have financing cash flows.

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,010
So when we issue the debt, that's a financing inflow.

19
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,220
When we repay the debt, that's going

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,120
to be a financing outflow on our cash flow statement.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,800
And then in the US at least, at the bottom of a cash flow

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,470
statement, there will be a statement on how much

23
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,810
cash is paid for interest.

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,850
And of course, there's going to be

25
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,060
details on all these things in the notes

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,590
to the financial statements.

27
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,760
So let's look at an example, which

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,250
is Advanced Micro Devices.

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,160
So right now, Advanced Micro Devices

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,800
is just knocking it out of the park.

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,960
They've sort of passed Intel as the best semiconductor company.

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,160
But that was not true about 10 years ago.

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,040
We are looking at AMD's financial statements

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,540
for 2011 and 2010.

35
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,840
So in red, notice that the current portion

36
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,530
of their long-term debt as of 2011 was close to $500 million,

37
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,990
which means that in the next year,

38
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,745
AMD had to pay down debt of $500 million.

39
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:11,450
The long-term portion of their debt was a $1.5 billion

40
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,450
at that time.

41
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,240
Companies also are required to provide

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,800
a table called the Contractual Obligations Table.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,730
And from this table, this is an incredibly useful table,

44
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,690
especially for companies like AMD.

45
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,400
If you're an investor in a company

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
like AMD, where there's a danger of bankruptcy.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,560
So this shows you by year in the future, 2012,

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,930
2013, et cetera, how much debt is going to come to,

49
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,690
how much interest is going to become payable,

50
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,840
how much operating lease payments we have to make,

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,110
how much capital lease payments we have to make,

52
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,230
and how much purchase obligations we've committed to.

53
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,180
So AMD, as a manufacturer, it's made commitments

54
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,570
to buy raw materials for its chips

55
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,760
from certain of its suppliers.

56
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,610
And it has to pay those suppliers $302 million

57
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,950
in cash in the year 2012.

58
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:22,510
And so the sum here in 2012 is that AMD has cash commitments

59
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,390
of nearly a billion dollars.

60
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,950
If you're an investor in AMD back at that time,

61
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,440
you would be wondering to yourself,

62
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,250
can AMD find a billion dollars in cash

63
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,390
to pay off these obligations?
