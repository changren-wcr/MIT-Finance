00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,390
Now let's look at lease disclosures for Delta,

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,270
which is the big airline.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,960
And Delta owns some of its airplanes.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,300
Again, though, because of tax reasons,

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,070
it leases a lot of its airplanes, because the lessor--

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,680
which is a financial institution--

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,770
can sort of get those tax benefits

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,970
and share them with Delta.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,320
So this is Delta's 2018 annual report

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,900
showing their 2018 and 2017 liabilities

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,130
and stockholders' equity.

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,210
Notice that on our balance sheets,

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,410
we've always had long term debt, and we've always

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,990
had capital leases or finance leases.

15
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,810
Starting in 2018, Delta puts operating leases

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,020
on its balance sheet.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,520
So, as you can see, there's nine current operating leases

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,270
of $5.8 billion there, but the year before, there

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,190
was nothing on their balance sheet.

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,010
And then we can see, also, that they've

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,340
got current maturities of debt and leases

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,910
on our balance sheet.

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,560
And we only see the current maturities or operating leases

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,180
after they chose to capitalize these operating leases.

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,130
Let's look briefly at the asset side of their balance sheet.

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,100
Notice that in property, plant, and equipment,

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,210
they've always had lots of property, plant, and equipment

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,640
under finance leases.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,520
Now that they started capitalizing the operating

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,910
leases, we see operating lease assets

31
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,320
going on their balance sheet.

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,830


33
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,940
So now we're going to do an example of a finance lease

34
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,190
to sort of understand what's going on with the accounting.

35
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,690
So Delta is going to lease an airplane.

36
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,140
The airplane has a current cost of $300 million.

37
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,840
Let's suppose the expected life of the asset is 30 years,

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,430
the lease term is 30 years, Delta's borrowing rate is 6%,

39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:21,000
and the annual lease payment is $21,975 per year.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,910
So this is a finance lease.

41
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,570
The reasons include the criteria for lease is not on the exam,

42
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,600
but you can see that the lease term is

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,140
the same as the useful life of the asset,

44
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,830
and you can see that the present value of the lease payments

45
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,680
is equal to the value of the asset.

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,580
So we'll just compute that on this slide.

47
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,860
So the finance lease obligation--

48
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,730
we're going to make 30 lease payments of $22 million.

49
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,120
If we look at the present value of a $1 annuity

50
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,240
for 30 years at a 6% discount rate, that's about 14.

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,550
And then if we multiply the $22 million

52
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,860
times the annuity factor, except for a little bit of rounding,

53
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,200
that comes out to be $300 million.

54
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,220
So that's how much we're going to put on our balance sheet

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,200
at the time we initiate the lease.

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,320
So the time we initiate the lease,

57
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,370
it's like 100% debt financing.

58
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,710
We're going to put on a $300 million lease obligation,

59
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,450
and then we're going to offset that,

60
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,940
make the balance sheet equation balance,

61
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,100
by putting on a $300 million lease asset.

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,920
So the present value of the lease

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,100
is equal to the present value of the periodic lease payments.

64
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,140
Now the accounting for the leases during the terms

65
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,920
of the lease--

66
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,160
remember how much is a lease payment.

67
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,850
It's about $22 million.

68
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,450
So cash is going to go down.

69
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,290
We're going to have interest expense on the lease, which

70
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:13,400
is the $300 million times our 6% interest rate.

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,440
And then the difference here is going to reduce the principal

72
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,060
like an installment loan.

73
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,360
So these lease loans are like your car loan,

74
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,750
or like your house loan, where you're continually

75
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,820
making the same payment.

76
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,890
In the early years most of that payment

77
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,150
goes to interest, as we show here, and little of it

78
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,040
goes to principal.

79
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,210
So that's how interest expense, the reduction

80
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,310
in the lease obligation--

81
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,250
remember, we've got an asset also--

82
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,320
so we're going to amortize that asset.

83
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,850
So we have amortization expense, a $300 million asset amortized,

84
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,260
or depreciated-- amortization and depreciation mean the same

85
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,340
thing--

86
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,440
amortized over 30 years.

87
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,010
So that's year one.

88
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,095
Let's just take a peek at year two.

89
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:14,010


90
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,980
So we've got year one still showing there.

91
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,990


92
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,840
We're going to have cash of the lease payment.

93
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,610
Now is interest expense is going to be

94
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,570
more or less in the second year than in the first year.

95
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,270
Remember, we've gotten rid of some of the lease obligations,

96
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,030
so we repaid it.

97
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,940
So our principal amount is less, so our interest expense

98
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,400
is going to be less in the second year,

99
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,080
and then that means that we're going

100
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,440
to get rid of more of the lease obligation in the second year,

101
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,420
and then amortization expense will be the same.

102
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,790
And here's what it looks like.

103
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,810
There's a spreadsheet on the web that shows this,

104
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,830
but this just shows over the course of the 30 years,

105
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,310
column B is beginning lease liability.

106
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,680
Here how much interest expense we pay on it.

107
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,800
Here's the lease payment.

108
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,870
Principal reduction is the difference

109
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,690
between the lease payment and the interest expense.

110
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,090
That gives us an ending lease liability.

111
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,290
And then we amortize the asset, and then that

112
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,000
gives us an ending lease asset.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,610
So all of this is just an application of present value

114
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,525
concepts, and the spreadsheet again is on the web.

115
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:44,130


116
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,910
And in terms of pictures, remember we're straight-line

117
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,380
amortizing the asset.

118
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,550
So the purple line there shows that the asset

119
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,980
is being amortized away in a straight-line fashion.

120
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,260
The liability, because of the fact

121
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,970
that we're paying mostly interest early on and not

122
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,860
that much principal, the liability has a concave shape.

123
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,100
And it tends to amortize off slower than the asset does.

124
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,670


125
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,240
And then we look at the cash flow effects.

126
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,360
The cash flow is going to be constant.

127
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,700
So we're going to be paying the $22 million a year

128
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,710
for 30 years.

129
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,950
But the expense goes down over time

130
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,770
because interest expense goes down,

131
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,500
whereas amortization expense is constant.

132
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,000
