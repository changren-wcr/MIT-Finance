1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,857
PROFESSOR: All right, so now we're

2
00:00:01,857 --> 00:00:03,920
going to talk about early retirement of bonds.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,720
And another way to say that, that's

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,300
a technical term, but sometimes companies

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,250
decide to repurchase their debt in the marketplace.

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,280
So they buy back their bonds.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,350
And then once they got those bonds,

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,750
because they're no longer outstanding, they retire them.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,060
And just to give us a picture for how this works,

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,070
here's Tesla.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,560
It was in the newspaper recently.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Tesla back in 2017 issued a 5.3% bond.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
And it was an eight year bond that it issued in 2017.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,080
So it was due in 2025.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,980
As you can see from the picture here,

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,460
this is a graph of the market value that bond.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,640
Once they issued it, the market value of that bond

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,530
went down for a long period of time, for about two years.

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,860
Now, why might that be?

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,750
So, over the last couple of years,

21
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,440
there were substantial doubts about whether Tesla

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,650
was going to succeed or whether it was going to go bankrupt.

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,440
So the bondholders were worried that it

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,280
was going to go bankrupt and they sold the bonds.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,190
Just recently, among other things

26
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,030
because Tesla has opened their Chinese factory,

27
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,150
and it looks like they're going to get lots of sales over that,

28
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,990
people have become much more optimistic about Tesla.

29
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,730
And the value of their bonds have gone back up to 100,

30
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,090
or the bonds are trading at par or at face

31
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,110
value for the first time ever.

32
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,650
But the point of this is that had Tesla

33
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,240
wanted to back about six months ago,

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,810
they could have bought those bonds back in the marketplace

35
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:02,170
and paid $80 for a $100 bond.

36
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,835
Bonds are quoted in percents.

37
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:07,750
So that would mean 80% or $1,000 bonds.

38
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,500
So they could have bought those bonds back for $800.

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,000
