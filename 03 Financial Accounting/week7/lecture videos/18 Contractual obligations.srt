1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,730
INSTRUCTOR: So recall when we were talking

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:09,040
about long-term debt, we saw a required disclosure

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,000
by Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,430
about their contractual obligations.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,570
So every company has to disclose this.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,225
Here's Delta Airlines' disclosure

7
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:28,060
of contractual obligations in their 2018 10K.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,510
So at the top you can see there's long-term debt,

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,350
there's principal, there's interest.

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,990
The next line is the finance lease obligations.

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,020
There's principal, there's interest.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,110
And the amounts are shown for the next five years.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:51,730
So 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,400
And then there's this big sum which

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,050
is thereafter, which is just 2024

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,140
and all the years after 2024.

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,700
So debt and finance leases have always been on balance sheet.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,230
Recently, as we saw earlier, Delta

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,320
has put their operating leases on balance sheet.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,220
So this is disclosure of cash flow amounts.

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,030
But these amounts also show up on the balance sheet.

22
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,448
But the remaining amounts in this table--

23
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:26,990
and they're going to differ depending

24
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,270
on whether you're looking at an airline

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,220
or whether you're looking at AMD--

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,230
so for Delta, Delta's make commitments to buy aircraft,

27
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,510
so they're going to buy them from Airbus

28
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,480
or they're going to buy buy them from Boeing.

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,550
So you can see there's a lot of big cash

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,930
flows in the future associated with Delta's commitments

31
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,010
to buy airplanes.

32
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,870
There's also commitments to their contract carriers, which

33
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,100
are the carriers that sort of are subsidiaries of Delta that

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,590
help Delta serve customers.

35
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,710
They've got obligations to their employees, their employee

36
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,759
benefit obligations, and they've got other obligations as well.

37
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,190
So all these cash flows that are disclosed here

38
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,240
are not on Delta's balance sheet.

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,530
So there's no liability for them on Delta's balance sheet.

40
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,860
So as we see, there's off balance sheet items.

41
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,500
So pre-2019, operating leases, purchase commitments

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,480
like these, aircraft, investment commitments.

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,390
And the common link here is these

44
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,670
are kind of like liabilities.

45
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,970
Remember for liabilities, we got three tests,

46
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,070
they require future economic sacrifice.

47
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,940
There's some kind of transactions

48
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,800
that occur that's given rise to the liability.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,750
And the final thing is remember, they

50
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,400
have to be estimable with a reasonable amount of precision.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,680
So companies have somehow kept these off balance sheet items

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,820
off balance sheet even though their liabilities, they

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,140
require economic sacrifice, but maybe they don't clearly

54
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,590
reflect a past transaction, or maybe they're

55
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,790
not reasonably estimable.

56
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,430
But they're still real cash flows

57
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,370
that we're going to probably have to make in the future.

58
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,180
So who cares about these off balance sheet items, and why?

59
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,820
So as I just suggested, clearly the companies care about them.

60
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,350
Companies want to make it look like they're low risk so

61
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,150
that more obligations or more liabilities you can keep off

62
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,550
of your balance sheet, somebody that's

63
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,490
reading your financial statements not very

64
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,010
carefully or not very thoughtfully

65
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,880
will see you as being lower risk than you truly are.

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,420
And that brings up the second point is that people that

67
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,450
lend you money--

68
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,140
so people that are lending Delta money--

69
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,740
really care about these off balance sheet obligations

70
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,130
because these are claims to cash that the firm is

71
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,780
going to probably have to pay in the future.

72
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,850
And those claims to cash compete with the lender's claims

73
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,690
to cash, so the lender wants to understand will Delta

74
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,430
have enough money to both meet their contractual obligations

75
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,270
and also to pay me, as a lender, off.

76
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,950
And then finally, this is the focus

77
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,820
we take in this course is investors.

78
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,060
So Delta may have slightly different off balance sheet

79
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,440
obligations than does, say, United or Southwest

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
or another big airline.

81
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,360
And we want to make apples to apples comparisons

82
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,510
between Delta and United Airlines

83
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,270
or between Delta and Southwest Airlines.

84
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,530
So one way to do this is to capitalize off balance sheet

85
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,128
items, that is, to value them, and then do a pro forma balance

86
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:07,920
sheet where we're putting these things back

87
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,130
on the balance sheet.
