1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,040
So now we're going to do an introduction to bonds.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,130
We're going to start with some bond terminology.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,700
Remember, in accounting there's lots of vocabulary,

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,390
and different people use the vocabulary in different ways,

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,800
but I'm going to define some terms.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,780
And remember, you can always go and look these terms up.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,990
And once you have a good grasp of what the term is,

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,300
you'll be able to understand it when people use it

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,410
in slightly different ways.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,020
So we're going to do four pieces of terminology on bonds.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,260
First of all, par value.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,590
Par value is the stated value on the face of the bond.

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:48,120
So most bonds, at least in the US, have a par value of $1,000.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,850
And that means if you buy a bond,

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,490
at the maturity of the bond, you will get $1,000 back.

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,970
Maturity is the date that the firm that

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,750
borrowed the money must pay us, the investors,

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,410
back our principal.

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,020
So this is the date that the firm

20
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,630
has to give us back our $1,000.

21
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,160
Coupon rate is the interest rate that's

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,790
stated on the face of the bond.

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,510
The coupon rate, as we'll see in some examples now,

24
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,200
is the rate that's used to determine periodic cash

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,140
interest payments, if there are any.

26
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,380
An example of when there are not any periodic cash interest

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,750
payments is a zero coupon bond.

28
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,020
So a zero coupon bond doesn't pay interest over time.

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,800
Instead, it just pays you one lump sum

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,780
at the maturity of the bond.

31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,040
There are three interest rates-- a little bit more terminology

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,790
here-- the three interest rates that we're

33
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,820
going to track with our bond accounting.

34
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,660
The first we've already talked about,

35
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,480
which is the coupon rate.

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,630
That's the interest rate that's stated on the bond

37
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,870
or in the bond, and that coupon rate

38
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,050
determines how much cash investors get.

39
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,919
An investor is going to get cash equal to the coupon

40
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,730
rate times the par value of the bond.

41
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,670
Coupon payments are typically semiannual.

42
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,840
So that means that if you buy a bond now, six months from now,

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,680
you'll get a coupon payment a, cash payment.

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,320
12 months from now, you'll get a coupon payment

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,720
or a cash payment, et cetera.

46
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,110
In this course, just for simplicity,

47
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,640
we're generally going to have coupon payments made annually,

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,660
just to make things a little bit simpler.

49
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,750
And then we're going to use two market interest rates,

50
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,210
and we'll talk where the market interest rate comes

51
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,310
from in just a second.

52
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,010
But there's the market interest rate

53
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,640
at issuance, which is the market rate

54
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,050
at the time we sold the bond.

55
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,550
So this rate determines the interest expense,

56
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,150
and it determines how much bond payable,

57
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,280
or how much of a liability we put on our balance sheet

58
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,050
at issuance.

59
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,650
This is also known as the effective interest rate.

60
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,260
This rate is going to be fixed or set at the time of issuance.

61
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,930
Now, as we'll see in a second, the market interest rate

62
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,940
bounces up and down over time.

63
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,720
And this is the rate that determines the current market

64
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,200
value of the bond.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,880
So if investors want a lot, a high yield right now,

66
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,130
the bond is going to be worth less.

67
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,160
If investors want a low yield right now,

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,240
then the bond is going to be worth more.

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,800
So this is going to be based on market conditions.

70
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,180
And again, it's going to fluctuate over time.

71
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,740
So here are some examples of these fluctuations

72
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,200
here's the 10-year US Treasury, that

73
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,920
means a US government bond that has a maturity

74
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,260
date 10 years from now.

75
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,230
And here's about 50 years worth of data.

76
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,810
You can see that long ago, the market interest rate on the US

77
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,510
Treasury was about 5%.

78
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,339
It got up as high as about 15% during the oil crisis

79
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,600
and the inflation boom of the early 1980s,

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,520
and then it's dropped down over time.

81
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,410
And then if you can see more finely

82
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,540
in this picture, the rate going from January 2018 to present,

83
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,930
so again, it started off at about 2 and 1/2%.

84
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,310
It got up to about 3%.

85
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,110
And it's gone down to less than 2% right now.

86
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,310
So the whole idea is that interest rates will vary over

87
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,370
time because of conditions in the economy,

88
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,880
and that's what you're seeing in these example pictures

89
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,930
of the 10-year US Treasury.
