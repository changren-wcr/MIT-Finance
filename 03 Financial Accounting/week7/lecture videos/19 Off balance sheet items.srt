0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,870
So what we're going to do in the remainder of this segment here

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,200
is talk about how we would go about capitalizing these

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,324
off balance sheet items.

4
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:11,040


5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,540
All right.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,620
So we got these cash flows that are off balance sheet.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,960
Moody's, which is a big credit rating agency.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,380
And so there's Moody's and Standard and Poor's.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,900
They rate people's ability to pay.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,700
OK.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,820
So if you got an A-plus rating from Standard & Poor,

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,700
that means you have a high ability to pay.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,430
If you've got a C-rating from Standard & Poor's

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,160
or Moody's, that means you have a low ability to pay.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,600
So Moody's and Standard and Poor's are major credit rating

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,410
agencies.

17
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,040
They're looking at these off balance sheet items,

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,550
and at least they claim that they're already

19
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,230
assessing the risk of these OBS, off balance sheet risk,

20
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,590
as part of their credit analysis already.

21
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,370
And it has a big impact on the issuer's credit rating

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,450
depending on the size and the nature of the exposure.

23
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,880
And this, as they say, is important

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,830
because as we just said a minute ago,

25
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,760
companies attempt to minimize the perception of risk

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,858
by trying to put various obligations off balance sheet.

27
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:27,400
So what we're going to do now is just

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,440
sort of talk about computing these off balance sheet amounts

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,740
and then putting them on, on balance sheet.

30
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,500
And when you do that--

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,140
well, it depends on your objective.

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,140
So if you're just trying to take a quick peek

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,390
at the financial statements, then you're

34
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,650
clearly not going to do this.

35
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,370
But if you're a financial analyst following the airline

36
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,930
industry, you want to be able to compare, again,

37
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:58,430
Delta with United Airlines on an apples to apples basis.

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,370
And then in case you want to do this yourself,

39
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,330
we're going to now go through some simple techniques

40
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,150
for valuing these off balance sheet items

41
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,120
and putting them on the balance sheet.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
So we've got this information about

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,320
the contractual obligations, about the

44
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,280
off balance sheet items.

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,140
So how would we use that to estimate the liability?

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,310
So the liability conceptually is just

47
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,980
the discounted present value of the off balance sheet item.

48
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,910
So we know what the off balance sheet items are.

49
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,080
So what we really need is off balance sheet items after

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,630
the fifth year-- remember there's that big thereafter

51
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,230
thing that happens--

52
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,090
and we also need a discount, right?

53
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,640
So when we do this, we're going to tell you

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,320
what discount rate to use.

55
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,570
So in this example, we're going to assume

56
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,420
the discount rate is 4%.

57
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,710
If we ask you to capitalize an off balance sheet item,

58
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,440
we'll tell you what the discount rate is.

59
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,920
Now, in the real world how would you estimate the discount rate?

60
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,540
So if you remember from our discussions last time,

61
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,290
Delta probably has publicly traded debt outstanding.

62
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,590
So we could look at the yield or the rates

63
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,290
on that publicly traded debt.

64
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,130
Also, as we saw earlier, Delta sort of shows you

65
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,110
what the cash flows from their leases

66
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,220
are and then comes up with a present value of those leases.

67
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,480
So you could reverse engineer that calculation

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,470
and figure out what implied rate Delta or a firm

69
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,950
is using on their leases.

70
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,325
And then in the real world, there

71
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:46,270
are various rules of thumb.

72
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,450
So always use a 5% discount rate, always multiply the cash

73
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,570
flows by 10.

74
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,540
So there are various rules of thumb

75
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,660
that people that know the industry very well.

76
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,930
Maybe the rule of thumb in the airline industry

77
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,950
is 6 times the next year's cash flow.

78
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,450
All right.

79
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,630
So just in summary.

80
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,490
So I just picked these numbers up from the slide we just

81
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,600
looked at a moment ago.

82
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,290
So these are the ones that are off balance sheet,

83
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,880
and then I put a total in for each year for the next five

84
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,810
years.

85
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,320
And then notice that we have that big thereafter amount

86
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,000
of about $12 billion, and the total is about $35 billion.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,350
Then if we just take the total amounts for each year,

88
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,780
all I'm doing is transposing them

89
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,080
to make it a little bit easier to do the calculation.

90
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,960
So again, we see the next five years,

91
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,940
and we see that thereafter amount.

92
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,960
So one trick in doing this is, we have to think to ourselves,

93
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,810
what years does that thereafter amount correspond to?

94
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,490
So clearly, part of it's 2024, but how

95
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,100
does that tail of cash flows--

96
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,350
how does that manifest itself starting in 2024?

97
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,440
So the rule of thumb we're going to use

98
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,210
is we're just going to look at the thereafter amount,

99
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,690
look at the year before.

100
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,490
So notice the thereafter is 11,594.

101
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,440
We're going to divide by the year before,

102
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,120
and then that gives us 3 and 1/2 years of cash flows

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,210
at the same rate as 2023.

104
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,450
We're going to round that down to three years

105
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,890
and then divide the 11,594 divided by 3

106
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:49,910
to give us annual cash flow starting in 2024 of 3,865.

107
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,440
So I'll just plug those in here.

108
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,480
So all we've just done is assume the thereafter is going

109
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,230
to be 3 equal cash flows 2024, 2025, 2026

110
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,300
and each of those cash flows is equal to 3,865.

111
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,680
So clearly, you can make other assumptions than this,

112
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,670
but this is a reasonable way to sort of say the thereafter

113
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,970
doesn't all happen in 2024.

114
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,710
Some of it happens in 2025 and 2026.

115
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,490
And then once we've got the cash flow as a rate like this,

116
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,960
we just pop these into our Excel spreadsheet,

117
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,040
take the present value-- so if our present value at 4%--

118
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,080
so the 2019 cash flow, we're going

119
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,870
to discount it 4% one time.

120
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,820
2020 is discounted at 4% two times, et cetera, et cetera.

121
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,330
That gives the present value of each of the cash flows,

122
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,820
and then we add all those up.

123
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,360
And then we get the present value, the $35 billion

124
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,012
nominal cash flows has a present value of about $30 billion.

125
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:06,620
Now, this looks a little intimidating.

126
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,360
So to bring this on our balance sheet,

127
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,340
we're going to add $30 billion to both assets and liabilities

128
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,150
as we did with operating leases earlier.

129
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,800
Now, as I started to say a minute ago,

130
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,780
this looks intimidating, but notice on examinations,

131
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,470
we're going to make it easier for you.

132
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,070
So here's a pretend company we're

133
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,250
asking you to capitalize its operating

134
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,570
lease in years before operating leases were on balance sheet.

135
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,880
And then notice that we tell you,

136
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,150
assume that this company makes equal lease payments

137
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,440
over a nine-year period.

138
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,190
So if you look at 2016, there's $600,000 there.

139
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,650
Thereafter is $2.4 million.

140
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,150
If you divide 600,000 into 2.4 million,

141
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,730
you get four payments of $600,000.

142
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:05,330
So the whole thing is basically nine payments of $600,000,

143
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:10,620
and that's easy for us to value using an annuity table.

144
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,490
So this is easier on the exam.

145
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,410
In the real world, you'll have to do

146
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,110
a little bit of calculations like this

147
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,480
and stick it into an Excel spreadsheet.

148
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,980
So having done that, we came up with $30 billion extra.

149
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,850
Does this matter in the case of Delta?

150
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,610
So their assets to equity ratio--

151
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,980
so their leverage ratio--

152
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,429
total assets divided by stockholders' equity--

153
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:44,230
is 4 and 1/2 with what they've got on balance sheet.

154
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,180
If we add this $30 billion to both assets and liabilities,

155
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,150
their leverage ratio goes to 6 and 1/2.

156
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,590
So their leverage ratio goes up by about 50%,

157
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,600
and that's quite meaningful.

158
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,070
And again, we're going to compare

159
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,610
that to, say, like United Airlines or other carriers

160
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,630
in the same industry to see how that comparison actually

161
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,570
works out.
