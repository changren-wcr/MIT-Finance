1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,250
PROFESSOR: Just a brief review from earlier in the class,

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,890
remember we talked about the present value of an annuity.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,300
So here's a picture of a three-year annuity that

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,350
pays out $100 at the end of the first year,

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,110
$100 at the end of the second year,

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,750
and $100 at the end of the third year.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,080
And we can just repeatedly present value that.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,660
So the present value of the first $100 is $92.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,940
The second $100 has a present value of $85.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,170
And the third $100 off in the future

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,870
has a present value at 8% discount rate of $79.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,190
And then we can add those all up and get the value

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,370
of this annuity as 257.71.

14
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,920
Or we can use an annuity formula.

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,720
And the annuity formula is, if we multiply the $100 annuity

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,350
payment times the present value of a three-year annuity at 8%,

17
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,080
the present value of a three-year annuity at 8%

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,180
is 2.57.

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,800
And we'll come up with that value.

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,430
And again, as we talked about earlier,

21
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,320
there are lots of tables out there you can look at.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,380
So if you Google PVOA table, you can get this number.

23
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,490
And if you're using Excel, the @NPV function

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,440
will also give you annuity values.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,160
So we're just reviewing this very briefly

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,200
because, as you'll see, a lot of leases look like annuities.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,630
Now, before we do that, let's just talk briefly

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,690
about the old leasing standard versus the new leasing

29
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,680
standard.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,460
So again, as I said before, the old standard basically

31
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,760
applies 2018 and before--

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,800
the new standard, after 2019 and after.

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,530
We have two types of leases--

34
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,800
rental leases and ownership leases.

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,550
The terminology under the old standard and the new standard

36
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,560
is very confusing, because they call

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,890
them both operating leases.

38
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,795
But under the old standard, the accounting

39
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:26,560
was the operating leases were off the balance sheet,

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,920
whereas under the new standard, the big difference

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,730
is, operating leases are on balance sheet.

42
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,660
As far as ownership leases go, the only thing that changed

43
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,160
was terminology.

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,740
So under the old standard, ownership leases

45
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,170
were called capital leases.

46
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,070
Now, under the new standard, they're called finance leases.

47
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,900
But the accounting form was exactly the same old standard

48
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,520
and new standard.

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,830
Here's an article about WeWork, which is the office space

50
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,740
rental company.

51
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,970
So what WeWork would do is rent a building for the long term.

52
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,050
So we take a five-year lease out on a building

53
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,100
and then sublet that space to tenants

54
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,690
under short-term deals that might be like a month or six

55
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,050
months or something like that.

56
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,110
And as you can imagine, this is risky

57
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,830
because you have a five-year liability

58
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,890
and you have a series of one-month assets.

59
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,920
So you've got an asset liability mismatch.

60
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,660


61
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,700
And the other thing is that prior

62
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,310
to the change in the accounting rules,

63
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,610
all these leases were off-balance sheet.

64
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,200
But during the time of WeWork's IPO, which ended up

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,410
being pulled, the accounting rules

66
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:58,390
changed so that WeWork had a total of about $35 billion

67
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,670
of future lease payments at the end of 2018.

68
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,210
All of these things were off balance sheet.

69
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,340
And only on-balance sheet--

70
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,340
the only on-balance sheet liabilities that it had

71
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,718
were about $3.1 billion.

72
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:19,930
So let's work through how big WeWork's off-balance sheet

73
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,600
debt was before the standard changed.

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,540
So WeWork has a total of about $35 billion

75
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,215
in future lease payments.

76
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:31,850


77
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,430
And what we want to do is figure out,

78
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,050
under the new standard, how much will

79
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,120
WeWork's liabilities increase.

80
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,330
And we need to compute the present value of these lease

81
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,180
payments.

82
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,880
And in order to do this, we have to figure out,

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,670
in our mind, how long will this $35 billion last.

84
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,890
So let's just make an assumption that these

85
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,030
are five-year leases.

86
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,900
So the leases are 5 payments of $7 billion a year.

87
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,580
So this is not necessarily realistic,

88
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,160
but it's just an operating assumption.

89
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,800
And then if you're curious, you can go back and change

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,718
this assumption in other ways.

91
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:16,510
And we're going to assume that the discount

92
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,150
rate on these leases is at 8%.

93
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,040
So WeWork at this time had a public bond

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,560
that traded at a rate of 8%.

95
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,360
So the discount rate at 8% seems reasonable.

96
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
So now, if we assume that we've got annuity

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,690
of 5 payments of $7 billion a year,

98
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,250
we're going to present value that annuity of 5 payments

99
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,220
at a discount rate of 8%.

100
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,710
You can look up the annuity factor.

101
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,480
It's 3.9927.

102
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,030
And if we multiply that by $7 billion,

103
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,540
the amount of liabilities that will be coming on-balance sheet

104
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,140
for WeWork is $27.9 billion.

105
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,800
So the off-balance sheet liabilities,

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,930
the OBS liabilities are about 9 times greater

107
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,100
than their on-balance sheet liabilities.

108
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,930
So this is one of the issues that WeWorks had,

109
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,650
is that you sort of had all these hidden liabilities.

110
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,270
And the standard change was going

111
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,270
to make these hidden liabilities go on balance sheet.
