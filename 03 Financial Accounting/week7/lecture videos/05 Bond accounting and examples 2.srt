1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,400
PROFESSOR: Now we're going to do the accounting,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,330
having sort of set things up.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,490
First of all, we're going to look at our par bond.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,480
So the par bond has a 6% coupon rate.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,400
At issuance, remember we get $10,000 in cash.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,250
And then to balance the balance sheet equation,

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,830
we're going to set up a liability for bond

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,890
payable equal to $10,000.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,900
Now let's think about the periodic accounting,

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,040
which has to do with our interest payments over time.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,760
So how much cash interest is this bond

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,550
going to pay in the first year?

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:45,520
Well, it's going to be 6% times the par value of the bond.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,338
So 6% times $10,000 is a $600 interest payment.

15
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:53,380
And then we're going to balance the balance sheet

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,710
equation with a interest expense of $600.

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,310
Same thing will happen in the second year.

18
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,280
Same thing will happen in the third year.

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,620
And then something else will happen in the third year,

20
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,050
which is the bond matures.

21
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,110
So we'll pay $10,000 worth of cash to our bondholders.

22
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,740
And the liability for the bond will have been discharged.

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,375
So we remove it from our balance sheet.

24
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,000
So now we're going to do the accounting

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,490
for a zero-coupon bond, which will

26
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,860
be a little bit more complicated than the accounting

27
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,350
for the par bond that we just did.

28
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,290
Remember our zero raises $10,000.

29
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,520
So when we sell the bond, we get $10,000 worth of cash.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,580
Now, how much of a liability do we have?

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,780
You don't have $10,000 of liability.

32
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,260
But at some point, our bond payable is going to be $11,910.

33
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,170
That point isn't right now, though.

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,015
So we got cash in at $10,000.

35
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:03,390
What are we going to do here to balance the balance sheet

36
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,750
equation?

37
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,800
What we're going to do is to create this discount account,

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,730
where the discount says in accounting speak,

39
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,860
right now, I owe you bondholders $10,000.

40
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,390
But over time, as the discount gets amortized away,

41
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,860
I'm going to owe you bondholders $11,910.

42
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,350
So let's see how this works now over time.

43
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,790
So the net bond payable here is the bond

44
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,470
payable of $11,910 minus the discount amount.

45
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,710
So right now, we owe our bond holders $10,000.

46
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,530
Now, this is a slide that we talked about just a couple

47
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,970
of minutes ago.

48
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,310
But I want to remind you of what we're going to do here.

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,800
So interest expense, remember, is the market rate

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,220
at the time the bond is issued times the net bond payable.

51
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,560
So at the start for the zero, our net bond payable

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,780
is $10,000.

53
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,610
Interest payable is the coupon rate times the par amount.

54
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,230
This is a zero-coupon bond.

55
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,970
So the coupon rate is 0%.

56
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,970
Our interest payable will be zero.

57
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,960
And then the difference between interest expense and interest

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,070
payable--

59
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,910
we're going to amortize against the bond discount account.

60
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,510
And we'll see that the discount account will go away over time.

61
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,680
So here's the accounting we just did a second ago.

62
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,730
When we sell the bond, we get $10,000 worth of cash.

63
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,810
We have a bond payable of $11,910.

64
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,660
And then we've got a discount of $1,910.

65
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,020
Notice the "XL" by that discount.

66
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,230
That means this is a contra liability account.

67
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,920
Remember, this is like depreciation in some ways.

68
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,130
Depreciation is a contra asset account.

69
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,650
This discount is a contra liability account,

70
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,840
which means that it reduces the bond payable to a net bond

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,899
payable of $10,000.

72
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,170
So now let's do the periodic accounting for this bond.

73
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:27,460
So in year 1, remember our cash interest payment is 0

74
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,560
because our coupon rate is 0.

75
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,830
On the far right-hand column in retained earnings,

76
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,190
our interest expense is $600.

77
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,440
And that's because our net bond payable

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,590
is $10,000 times our 6% market interest rate at the time

79
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,330
we issued it.

80
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,120
And then in the middle, to make the balance sheet equation

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,900
balance, we're going to amortize the difference

82
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,260
between the interest expense of $600

83
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,560
and the interest payment of 0.

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,220
So we're going to amortize $600 worth the discount

85
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,550
in the first year.

86
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,150
So what will be the net bond payable then

87
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,350
at the end of the first year?

88
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,970
So it will be our discount amount now will be $1,310.

89
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,940
So our net bond payable will be $10,600,

90
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,540
which means that we owe our bondholders what we originally

91
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:31,750
owed them plus an additional $600 worth of interest.

92
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,200
Now let's see what happens in the second year.

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,180
Again, our cash coupon payment is 0.

94
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,030
Our interest expense now has gone up because now we're

95
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,440
paying interest on interest.

96
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,490
So we've got interest expense on our net bond payable of $10,600

97
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,930
times 6% equals $636.

98
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,300
And then again, to make sure the balance sheet

99
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,320
equation balances, we're going to set the discount amount

100
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,820
to be amortized equal to the difference between interest

101
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,460
expense and interest payable.

102
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,090
Now, notice now that the net bond payable

103
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,290
has gotten bigger by $636.

104
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:27,230
So in our final year, again, we got zero cash interest.

105
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,960
We've got interest expense on our net bond

106
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:37,940
payable of $11,236 times 6%, which is $674.

107
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,270
And the difference is going to be a reduction

108
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,000
of the amortized discount.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,560
We're amortizing the difference as a reduction to the discount.

110
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,590
And then the final thing that's going to happen

111
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,750
is going to pay off the bonds.

112
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,920
We now owe the bondholders $11,910.

113
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,430
And we're going to-- because we no longer owe the bondholders

114
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:10,970
that money, the bonds payable will go away at that point.

115
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,990
So you can see what the discount again--

116
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,440
each year, as we amortize the discount,

117
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,390
net bonds payable is going to increase.

118
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,770
And that's going to increase interest expense.

119
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,320
And over time, net bonds payable will equal to the amount

120
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,600
that we owe our bondholders.

121
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,180
This is an Excel example that's on our website.

122
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,090
And I encourage you to look over this just

123
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,570
to see how you can do these calculations in Excel.

124
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,460
So here's our three years on the left-hand column, our beginning

125
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,560
bond payable on column A, cash interest paid, which

126
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,000
is 0 for this zero-coupon bond, interest expense as we

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,360
calculated it just a minute ago, discount amortization,

128
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,160
which is the difference between interest expense and cash

129
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,040
interest paid, our discount amount in column E

130
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,660
that amortizes off over time, giving us our net bond payable.

131
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,210
So play with us a little bit.

132
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,140
I encourage you.

133
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,470
And you can see how the accounting for these discount

134
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,500
bonds work.
