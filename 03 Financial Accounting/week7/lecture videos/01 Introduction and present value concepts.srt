1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,782
PROFESSOR: In this class, we're going

2
00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:05,050
to talk about bonds and long term debt.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,610
We're going to start by reviewing some present value

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,110
concepts.

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,800


6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,430
So long term debt is one of the firm's key sources

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,780
of financing.

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,120
You either sell debt.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,670
Or you can maybe finance your firm through selling stock.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,170
What we're going to talk about today

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,520
are bonds, which are a major type of long term debt.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,070
They're similar to a loan from a bank.

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,630
But they have certain differences

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,650
that we'll go through now.

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,760
To be able to talk about bonds and to value bonds,

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,600
we need to use two present value concepts.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,000
First is the present value of a single future payment.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,750
Second is the present value of an annuity

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,950
or a number of future payments.

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,620
For some of you, competing present

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,120
values already second nature.

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,780
But for others of you, it's not.

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,720
I'm going to go and review these concepts.

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,190
But those of you who know them already,

25
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,440
please go ahead and jump ahead.

26
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,470
So we're going to start with the present value

27
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,870
of a future payment.

28
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,810
So future value, here's the formula,

29
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:25,700
is related to present value by a function of the interest rate.

30
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,610
Let's do some examples.

31
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,970
If we invested $1 today, how much

32
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:37,320
would it be worth in a year if interest rates are 8%?

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,160
Well, a year from now, if we put that money in a savings bank,

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,380
we get our dollar back.

35
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,730
We get 8% interest.

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,700
Another way to think about that is we've

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,490
got 1 plus 8% interest compounded for one year,

38
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,280
or $1.8.

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,190
Now stretching that just a little bit,

40
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,220
what's the future value of a dollar

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,850
invested today for three years, again,

42
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,000
if interest rates are 8%?

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,970
So in the first year, we'll get 1 plus our 8% interest.

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,760
In the second, that will compound.

45
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,730
And in the third year, it'll compound again.

46
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,370
So what we'll end up getting is 1.08, plus the interest rate

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,290
compounded for three years, which equals 1.26.

48
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,910
So that's a couple of examples of the formula in red above.

49
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,820
Now we're just going to invert that formula

50
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,830
and talk about the present value.

51
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,060
For the present value formula, the present value

52
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,420
is the future payment divided by 1

53
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,960
plus the interest rate raised to the number of periods

54
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,350
over which you're computing it.

55
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,230
So again, if we're going to get $1 in a year,

56
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,910
how much is that worth for us today?

57
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,690
So clearly, it's worth less than $1

58
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,440
because we have to wait for a year to get that dollar.

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,030
And then formally, that's going to be

60
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,010
worth $1 divided by 1 plus the interest rate

61
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,020
raised to the 1 power.

62
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,160
So that's 0.925 and change.

63
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,250
Similarly, if we receive $1 in three years, that

64
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,250
will be worth $1 divided by 1.08%,

65
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:42,240
the interest rate raised to the third power or 0.793.

66
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,760
And then to see this in a picture,

67
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,160
suppose now that we were to get $100 three years from now

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,220
and interest rates are still 8%.

69
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,020
So we have to wait one year, we have to wait a second year,

70
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,650
and in the third year, we're going to get our $100.

71
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,430
Now again, clearly, this is worth less than $100

72
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,790
because we could put the money in the bank at 8%

73
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,760
and have something more than $100

74
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,520
if we had invested in at 8%.

75
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,970
So using our present value formula from above,

76
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,780
this amount is going to be worth $100 divided

77
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:30,360
by 1 plus our interest rate cubed or 79.38.

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,850
Now you can find this factor by googling present value table.

79
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,690
Obviously, you can stick the formula into your calculator.

80
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,410
And there's also functions on Excel to compute this formula.

81
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,670
So that's a present value of a single future payment.

82
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,690
Now we're going to combine those by doing the present value

83
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,200
of an annuity.

84
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,840
So all a three year annuity is, pictured here,

85
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,670
is in a year from now we got $100, two years from now, we

86
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,110
get to another $100, and then three years from now

87
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,600
we'll get a further $100.

88
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,780
So one way to compute this is just sequentially

89
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,020
compute the present value of $100, which we just did,

90
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,280
which is $93, compute the present value of $100 two years

91
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,730
from now, which is $85, compute the present value of $100 three

92
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,390
years from now, which is $79.

93
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,800
Add all those up.

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,160
It's about $258.

95
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,980
Now that requires a little bit of calculation.

96
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,730
It's not that hard to do in an Excel spreadsheet.

97
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:52,380
And this is an ordinary annuity three payments in a rear at 8%.

98
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,920
They're also annuity tables that you can Google.

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,010
So if you Google PVOA, which is present value of an annuity,

100
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,080
you can see this table.

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,840
Also if you use the Excel at NPV function,

102
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,870
it will also calculate a present value of an annuity.

103
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,490
So those are two building blocks, a single lump

104
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,360
sum paid in the future.

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,490
What's the present value of that?

106
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,770
And then what's the present value of payments in an annuity

107
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,730
form where you get the same amount of money every year

108
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,240
for some number of years?
