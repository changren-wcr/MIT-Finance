0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,590
Now again, sometimes companies repurchase their bonds

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,510
in the open market.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,340
And as we've seen before and as we just

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,880
saw in the Tesla example, when things are going badly

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,980
for a company, their bond prices go down.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,280
So that's credit quality issues.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,680
And then sometimes interest rates go up and down,

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,850
and we're also going to affect the market value of the bonds.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,070
So if I decide to buy back my bonds right now,

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,710
it's unlikely to be the case that I'm

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,000
going to pay exactly par value or book value for that,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,060
because of the fact that interest rates have

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,880
been moving around over time since I issued that bond.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,090
So if we pay more than book value

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,120
or more than the liability on our balance sheet,

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,400
then we'll have a loss.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,210
If we pay less than book value or less

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,640
than the liability on the balance sheet,

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,210
then we'll have a gain.

20
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,810
So let's do some examples.

21
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,630
Now, going back to the zero coupon bonds

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,740
that we were talking about earlier, at the end of 2015,

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:22,150
we had a bond payable of $11,910 and accrued discount of $1,310,

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:27,300
so that net bond payable was $10,600.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,490
Now, let's suppose that in the open market

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,360
our interest rate has gone up from 7%--

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,540
gone up to 7% from 6%, and now we repurchase those bonds.

28
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,420
How much do we have to pay to repurchase those bonds?

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,140


30
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,090
Well, qualitatively, two years from now, our bond holders

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,100
are going to get from us $11,910.

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,510
So they want right now the present value of that.

33
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,510
Quantitatively, or mathematically,

34
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,790
that present value is $11,910, discounted

35
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:19,500
over two years at 7%, So that mathematical present value is

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,270
$10,403, which is less than our book value of $10,600.

37
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,290
So the market value went down because interest rates went up,

38
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,030
and so we can pay off these bonds less than the amount

39
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,515
that we recorded on our books.

40
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:40,070


41
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,090
And our balance sheet equation for that transaction,

42
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,950
if we bought back all the debt for $10,403,

43
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,830
well, first, let's keep track of cash.

44
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,680
We know that cash is going to go down by $10,403.

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,300
The bonds will no longer be outstanding,

46
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,230
so bonds payable is going to go away.

47
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,090
Again, the bonds will no longer be outstanding,

48
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,090
so the discount's going to go away.

49
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,270
And then we'll just plug or solve

50
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,100
for the gain or loss of retained earnings.

51
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,610
So that's the number that balances the balance sheet

52
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,910
equation.

53
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,930
And in this case, we're going to make a gain of $197

54
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,010
if we buy this debt back and retire it.

55
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,960
Now let's do the flip side of this example.

56
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,190
But before we do that, let's note

57
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,120
that this gain or loss is going to be on our income statement.

58
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,270
Let's also note this is very similar to the accounting

59
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,680
that we talked about earlier when we sell PP&E.

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,160
So if we sell PP&E, the first thing we want to do

61
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,600
is record cash.

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,990
We no longer own the property, plant, and equipment,

63
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,870
so that's going to leave our balance sheet.

64
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,330
We no longer own the property, plant, and equipment,

65
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,700
so we're going to have no longer any accumulated depreciation.

66
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,320
And then as we saw then, we're going

67
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,550
to solve for the gain or loss.

68
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,110
So the accounting here, although it's a liability

69
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,649
and PP&E is an asset, is very, very similar.

70
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,010
Now let's do the flip side of the example,

71
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,060
when we pay more than book value for our bonds.

72
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,110
So let's imagine that we repurchase the bonds,

73
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,970
discount rates have gone down to 5%,

74
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,730
so we know that that means the value of the bonds

75
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,540
have gone up.

76
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,390
And in particular, they've gone up

77
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,640
to $10,803, which is the present value of $11,910

78
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,020
that we'll have to pay our bond holders two years from now,

79
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,220
discounted at a 5% rate.

80
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,870
So again, the transaction that we're going to record, first,

81
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,620
keep track of cash.

82
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,300
Cash is going to go down by $10,803.

83
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,030
We're going to then remove the bond payable.

84
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,550
We're going to then remove the discount.

85
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,090
And then we're going to solve for the loss, in this case,

86
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,740
of $203 on debt retirement.
