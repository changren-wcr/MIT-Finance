1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,680
PROFESSOR: So now we're going to talk about bond accounting,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,530
which is our focus today.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,430
And we're going to work through some examples.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,040
So this is a summary of the accounting.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,840
Turns out the accounting is fairly simple,

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,930
and we need to know three things, basically.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,420
We need to, in red, how do we compute interest expense.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,040
And that's going to be the market

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,350
rate when the bond was issued times the net bond payable.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,180
And we'll define in just a second

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,850
what net bond payable means.

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,030
And then interest payable, we've already talked about.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,580
That's the coupon rate, which is again

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,210
stated on the face of the bond times the power

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,330
amount of the bond.

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,630
So if it's a $10,000 bond and the coupon rate is 6%,

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,100
interest payable will be $600.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,080
And then the final piece of accounting

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,420
is that the difference between interest expense

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,560
in the red of the first thing and interest payable in the red

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,290
in the second thing is going to be

22
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,580
an amortization of either a discount or a premium.

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,760
And we'll work through that in just a second.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,030
So in this class, we're going to do two examples.

25
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,080
We're going to do a bond issue at par value

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,310
a par, bond, which again means that at the time

27
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,430
the bond was issued, the coupon rate

28
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,800
was equal to the market rate.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,250
And then we're going to do the accounting for a zero coupon

30
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,680
bond, which again means that the coupon rate is 0%

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,860
or it pays no interest until maturity.

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,950


33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,640
So here's our example.

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,310
We've got a bond.

35
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,480
We sell it on the 1st of January in 2015.

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,170
When we sell the bond, we get $10,000.

37
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,250
At that time, the market interest rate is 6%.

38
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,700
And the bond has a maturity date three years

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,300
from the time of issuance.

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,890
So in this case, it'll mature on December 31, 2017.

41
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,740
And we're going to look at two alternatives, again,

42
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,230
a par bond and a zero bond.

43
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,540
So first of all, the par bond raises $10,000

44
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,730
at the time we issue it.

45
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,790
The coupon rate is 6%.

46
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,080
Yearly payments of interest are at the end of each year.

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,300
And the repayment of the principal

48
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,280
is at the end of the third year.

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,350
And then we're going to look at a zero coupon

50
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,230
bond, where we don't get any interest

51
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,260
payments until maturity.

52
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,440
And then at maturity, at the end of year three,

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,270
we'll get all of our interest plus our principal.

54
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,070
And what we want to do now is just

55
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,940
think about what annual payments are required first,

56
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,140
under the power bond and then second, under the zero coupon

57
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,190
bond.

58
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,950
So here's a table.

59
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,500
The middle column is the coupon bond.

60
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,070
The coupon bond has a 6% interest rate.

61
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,710
The zero coupon bond has a 0% interest rate.

62
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,660
Now remember, the coupon bond pays annual coupons.

63
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,920
So if we get $10,000 for the proceeds on it ,

64
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:43,020
we multiply that par value of $10,000 times our coupon of 6%.

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,080
At the end of the first year, we'll get $600 for this bond.

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,650
At the end of the second year, we'll get another $600

67
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,580
for this bond.

68
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,450
At the end of the third year, we'll get another $600

69
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,780
for the bond.

70
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,860
And at that point, the bond will mature,

71
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,040
so we'll get $10,600 in the third year.

72
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,270
So the total payments on this coupon bond

73
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,970
are $11,800 in cash.

74
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,850
Now the zero, how much are we going

75
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,839
to get at the end of the first year?

76
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,140
It's going to be 0 how much are we

77
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,450
going to get at the end of the second year?

78
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,340
Again, zero.

79
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,550
How much are we going to get at the end of the third year?

80
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,810
Well, we have to work that out now.

81
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,420
So if we're getting $10,000 today

82
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,050
and interest rates are 6% a year,

83
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,660
how much do we owe our bond holders

84
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,160
at the end of three years?

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,020
So that's an example of a future value calculation, where

86
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,020
we get $10,000 today, we're going

87
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,270
to compound 6% interest over 3 years,

88
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,260
and we'll work that out--

89
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:06,730
excuse me -- we'll work that amount out to $11,910.

90
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,620
So notice that the zero, the total payments on the zero

91
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,340
are $11,910, which is $110 more than the total payments

92
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,140
on the coupon bond.

93
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,460
That's because there's interest on interest on the zero because

94
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,990
of the fact that we're not paying

95
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,320
our bondholders on an annual basis the way

96
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,090
that we are on the par bond.

97
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,490
So what we want to do now--

98
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,860
we know the answer to this because we

99
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:42,130
know that this par bond, which pays us out a total of $11,800

100
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,130
has a present value of $10,000.

101
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,760
But we want to just check that.

102
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,860
So remember, the par bond shown there in our table

103
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,820
pays us $600 in the first year, $600

104
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,870
in the second year, $600 in the third year

105
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,450
plus a lump sum payment of $10,000.

106
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,550
So if you think about that-- and this is the key to bond pricing

107
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:14,670
--that's an annuity of $600 plus that lump sum of $10,000.

108
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,230
So how can we check that equals $10,000?

109
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:27,630
So our annuity value is a three year annuity that pays us $600.

110
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,600
The discount rate or the interest rate on that annuity

111
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,880
is 6%.

112
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
We can come up with that annuity value

113
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,400
from a table, the PWA table on the internet.

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,300
Or we can use Excel.

115
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,340
We can use our calculators.

116
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,040
We'll come up with a total annuity value equals $1604.

117
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,540
and then we compute the lump sum value,

118
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,870
which is the present value of a $10,000 payment to us in three

119
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,890
years.

120
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,030
And that present value is $8,396.

121
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,640
And notice that that sums to $10,000.

122
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,390
So our check goes through.

123
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,050
More generally, you can price any bond using this technique

124
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,400
because any bond is going to be an annuity equal to the coupon

125
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,710
payments to you plus a lump sum, which is equal to the maturity

126
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,220
value of the bond.

127
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,870
Then all you have to do is to plug-in your interest rate

128
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,120
and then do these calculations to come up

129
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,480
with the value of the bond.
