00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,870
PROFESSOR: Now one final point I want to make here.

1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,220
So this is going back.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,440
And we looked at this earlier in the session.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,800
So remember in 2017, Delta had no liability

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,770
for operating leases on its balance sheet.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,600
In 2018 it early adopted the new accounting standard

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,380
and put about a $6 billion liability on balance sheet

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,360
for their operating leases.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,840
So one thing this means intuitively

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,250
is that Delta, in 2018, is not really

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,640
comparable to Delta in 2017.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,490
Because 2017 doesn't have $6 billion

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,740
worth of liabilities on its balance sheet.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,460
Whereas 2018 does.

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,880
And as a practical matter for you all as you

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,240
become professionals, you're not actually

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,630
necessarily going to be looking at financial statements.

17
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,200
You're going to be looking at data feeds.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,450
So this article in The Wall Street Journal from 2019

19
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,720
says these new lease accounting rules

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,930
have resulted in potentially misleading data feed.

21
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,430
So the data in 2017 didn't have the operating leases

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,720
on balance sheet.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,730
The data in 2018 did.

24
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,910
OK, now if you do a financial ratio, like a leverage ratio,

25
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,660
if you do that naively you'll see that Delta's leverage

26
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,750
ratio jumps in 2018.

27
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,040
But the issue is how the data providers

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,110
are including these leases.

29
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,970
So one thing you could do is go back

30
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,570
and adjust the historical data to put

31
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,670
the leases on balance sheet.

32
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,300
The other thing you could do is adjust

33
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,260
the current and future data to remove the operating

34
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,360
leases on balance sheet.

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,400
But really probably what people are doing

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,480
is they don't really think about it.

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,630
And so you see this big jump in leverage,

38
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,639
which is just an accounting mirage so to speak.

39
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,450
It's a cautionary tale on the analytical impact,

40
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,400
the article says.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,860
And this analytical impact is really

42
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,260
big in airlines or transportation,

43
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,160
where you got a lot of leases coming on balance sheet.

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,660
So you always have to understand,

45
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,760
if you're getting information from a data

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,010
feed, how that data was computed as it went into the data feed.

47
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,700


48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,080
So in terms of takeaways for leases,

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,450
we talked about the rationale for leases,

50
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,970
why companies do leases.

51
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,240
We talked about the difference between operating and finance

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,770
leases.

53
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,370
We talked about how, under the old accounting standard,

54
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,640
operating leases were off-balance sheet.

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
Under the new standard they're on balance sheet.

56
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,710
So again, 2017 and 2018 for Delta,

57
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,860
without any doing any adjustment,

58
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,420
you're not able to compare them apples to apples.

59
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,670
And we talked about how we can use the disclosures related

60
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,650
to contractual obligations to estimate these leases so

61
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,780
that we can compare the off-balance sheet

62
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,380
items on an apples to apples basis,

63
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,150
both for the firm over time and for the firm

64
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,470
as it's compared to its peers.
