00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,000
So we're going to talk about leases

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,850
in the second section of our talk

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,850
about interest-bearing liabilities.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,330
So in terms of leases, our objectives

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,990
are talk a little bit about the rationale for leasing,

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,790
learn about under US GAAP, two types of leases, an operating

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,320
lease and a finance lease.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,080
We're going to understand the income statement

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,580
and balance sheet effects of operating and finance leases

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,260
from the lessee's perspective.

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,270
So if you lease a car from a dealer, you're the lessee.

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,830
You drive the car.

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,480
The dealer is the lessor.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,790
We're not going to worry too much about the lessor.

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,070


16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,190
Now just recently, they became a new accounting standard

17
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,150
on leases.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,690
And in the US, under the new standard,

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,290
for companies that have fiscal years beginning after December

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,510
15, 2018, we're going to put liability for leases

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,460
on the balance sheet.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,150
Under the previous standard, as we'll talk about a little bit,

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,790
some of those leases were off-balance sheet,

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,480
not on the balance sheet.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,520
And because some liabilities or some liability-like items

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,800
are off-balance sheet, we're going

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,630
to talk about how to estimate a liability for off-balance sheet

28
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,180
items.
