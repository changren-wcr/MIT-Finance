1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,550
INSTRUCTOR: So now we're going to talk about fair value

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,420
of bonds and other liabilities.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,130
So the FASB, which is again the American Accounting Standards

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,100
Center, has offered firms the option

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,240
to value all their financial liabilities and assets

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,030
at fair values.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,840
Let's just talk briefly, does this make sense?

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,100
So as we saw with Tesla just a minute ago,

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,220
Tesla was performing badly.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,040
There were concerns about its bankruptcy.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,470
Its debt became riskier.

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:41,320
And its debt went from 100 cents on the dollar to about $0.82

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,790
on the dollar.

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,120
Now, what does this do to its market interest rate?

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,210
So Tesla is riskier.

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,000
Its market interest rate went up.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,270
What it did to do to the market value of that bond

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,130
while the bond values we saw in the picture went down?

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,890
What did that do to the coupon rate?

20
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,790
It does nothing.

21
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,570
The coupon rate, remember, is fixed at the time of the bond

22
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,820
issuance.

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,390
So if Tesla were to mark its debt to market value,

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,360
it had this deterioration in credit quality,

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,230
what would happen to its assets and liability?

26
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,090
So you would mark the liability down.

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,060
And then the balance sheet, you would have

28
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,110
a gain in shareholders' equity.

29
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:40,730
So as an example, here's our zero coupon bond again.

30
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,590
We have net bonds payable of 10,600.

31
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,820
And we're going to mark our liabilities to market value.

32
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,370
Interest rates have gone up.

33
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,290
The book value of the bond has gone down.

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,050
So the accounting entry we would make

35
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,480
is to increase the discount.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,510
That would reduce the net bond payable.

37
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,480
And then we'd have a fair market value adjustment

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,030
in stockholder's equity, which would

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,740
have the effect of increasing other comprehensive income.

40
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,690


41
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,020
So bonds payable after we made this entry would be 10,403.

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,180
And then stockholders' equity would have gone up by 197.

43
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,420
So all firms, regardless of whether they execute

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,100
this fair value option, are required by the FASB

45
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,550
to include a footnote in their financial statements

46
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,210
that tells investors what the fair value or the market

47
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,160
value of their debt is.

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,650
And so here's AMD's footnote back from 2011.

49
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,670
Notice that the fair value in 2011

50
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:03,110
was slightly above the carrying amount as it was also in 2010.

51
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,710
If we look at this over time, all I've done here

52
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,260
is made a little table that shows AMD's fair value of debt

53
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,680
over time that I've gathered from their financial

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
statements.

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,630
So the book value of the debt in 2008 was $4.6 billion.

56
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:28,050
The market value of that debt was 46%.

57
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:36,080
And as you can see, that during the crisis period in 2008,

58
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,170
the market expected AMD to go bankrupt.

59
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,500
They didn't think that AMD was going to make their payments.

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,660
Therefore, AMD's debt was selling at $0.46 on the dollar.

61
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:54,510
Over time as the crisis passed, AMD continues to do better.

62
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,260
And the fair value of their debt increases

63
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,060
outside the crisis period.

64
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,550
So I just want to share this little story with you.

65
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,830
So we've been focusing now on debt from the perspective

66
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,230
of the firm that issues that.

67
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,420
Now, clearly as we've talked about before

68
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,790
and we'll talk about more in the future,

69
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,370
there's a group of companies that own the debt.

70
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,610
So firms might issue debt.

71
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,829
Governments might issue debt.

72
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,150
And then somebody else like a bank buys that debt.

73
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,250
So in Italy, again, because the Italian government

74
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,240
has problems with its financing, the yields on its bonds

75
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,830
have gone up.

76
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,950
And that means the value of those bonds have gone down,

77
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,290
so that any Italian bank that holds us bonds

78
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,950
and classifies them as either trading securities

79
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,420
or available for sale securities loses lots of money.

80
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,180
And that puts pressure on the banks.

81
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,960
But the banks have come up with an accounting solution here.

82
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,530
And the accounting solution is, going forward, instead of

83
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,330
classifying those bonds as available for sale or trading

84
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,110
securities, they're going to call them held to maturity.

85
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,440
And as you recall, held to maturity debt

86
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,680
you never do any accounting for until the bonds mature.

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,470
So this is going to be an accounting

88
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,840
solution to investing in volatile government debt.

89
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,540


90
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,500
So in terms of takeaways from today,

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,020
we talked about bond accounting.

92
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,160
We talked about what happens at interest at issuance.

93
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,810
We talked about what happens when

94
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,340
we pay interest, what happens when interest is accrued,

95
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,210
and how we amortize discounts and premiums.

96
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,650
We talked about what happens if we repurchase the debt

97
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,300
and retire it.

98
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,490
And we talked about how to account

99
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,970
for the fair value of the bond.

100
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,680
And I know that this is a lot of material all at once.

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,460
What I encourage you to do is practice some examples,

102
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,410
get comfortable with this.

103
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,140
It looks difficult. But once you work

104
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,640
through a couple of examples, for example,

105
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,090
the spreadsheet that I mentioned earlier,

106
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,970
you'll become more and more comfortable with this

107
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,480
and it will not be so difficult.
