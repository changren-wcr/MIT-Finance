1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,480
PROFESSOR: So we've just looked at finance leases.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,790
Now we're going to look at the accounting for operating

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,000
leases.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,400
We're going to continue on with our same example of Delta

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,530
leasing an airplane for 30 years.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,400
But now, we're going to change the assumptions just

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,840
a little bit and assume that the accounting for the lease

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,300
is an operating lease accounting.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,980
And this is not on our exam, but maybe the life of the plane

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,860
is much greater than 30 years.

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,150
So that would give us operating lease accounting.

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,960
And at the start of the lease, start of the operating lease,

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,610
the accounting is exactly the same as for a finance lease.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,580
Both the asset and the liability are

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,560
valued at the present value of the lease payments.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,010
So as we saw with the finance lease,

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,830
present value of the lease payments is $300 million.

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,830
That's going to come on our balance sheet

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,800
as an asset, the lease asset.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,110
And it's going to come on our balance sheet

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,230
as a liability, the lease obligation.

22
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,260
So the initial present value of the lease,

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,380
again, is just the present value of those 30

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,310
payments of $22 million a year.

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,360
Now, ongoing accounting for operating

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,770
leases under IFRS, International Financial Reporting Standards,

27
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,390
this is sensible.

28
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,360
Operating lease accounting is pretty much the same

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,400
as finance lease accounting under IFRS.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,930
In the US under US GAAP, which is run, again,

31
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,570
by FASB, the Financial Accounting Standards

32
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,310
Board, which is somewhat of a political operation--

33
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,560
so US firms lobbied the FASB so that operating leases

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,930
would have the same expense each period.

35
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,620
And you would wonder why did they do this?

36
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,940
Remember from our earlier discussion of finance leases,

37
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,330
the finance lease starts with high expense,

38
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,890
and the expense gets lower as you go through the lease term.

39
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,100
And this higher expense is undesirable for companies.

40
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,390
So they'd rather have a lower expense to start.

41
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,380
So they lobbied the FASB which contrived

42
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,750
to have the same expense.

43
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,970
And in order to do that, we have to back into, solve for,

44
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,390
or plug for, what's called amortization expense.

45
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,140
So let's see how this works in an example.

46
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,550
But before this, I want to emphasize that we are

47
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,610
focusing here on simple leases.

48
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,210
And what a simple is, it's the same period payment each year.

49
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,000
So if it's a 10 year lease, say like it's $1,000 a year

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,620
each year, and the first payment is

51
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,410
at the end of the first year, not

52
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,740
at the start of the first year.

53
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,620
And more complicated leases, which

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,470
are not going to be on our exam, the accounting

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,970
is basically the same, but it's much more complicated.

56
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,930
So for that reason, we're just going

57
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,930
to focus on simple leases.

58
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,710
And the way the accounting for operating leases

59
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:29,970
works in the US, is first we compute straight line expense.

60
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:36,650
So if we had a lease that had 10 payments of $1,000 each,

61
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,340
the total cost of the lease would be $10,000.

62
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,730
We divide that by the number of payments, which would be 10.

63
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,110
So the straight line expense of $1,000

64
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,400
would be the same as the annual lease payment.

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,190
And then second, we would calculate

66
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,700
what's considered the interest expense on the liability.

67
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,460
And then we would solve for the, quotation marks, amortization

68
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,960
expense, by subtracting the so-called interest

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,640
expense, in quotation marks, from the straight-line expense.

70
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,040
And I'm using quotation marks here,

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,980
and textbooks do the same thing, because there's really

72
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,280
no separate amortization expense.

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,350
There's no separate interest expense for an operating lease.

74
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,470
We're just calculating those as intermediate steps,

75
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,170
as we'll see on the next slide.

76
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,480


77
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,980
So here's our ongoing accounting for operating leases.

78
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,290
We're going to just look at year one.

79
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,120
But with the operating lease, every year

80
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,100
is going to be the same, as we'll see in a minute.

81
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,450
So first thing we want to do, keep track of cash.

82
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:57,670
So the lease payment is about $22 million, $21,795.

83
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,910
So cash goes out.

84
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,150
We pay $22 million at the end of the first year.

85
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:11,590
That reduces our debt, or obligation, to the lessor.

86
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,850
Then lease expense is going to be $21,795 as well.

87
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,060
And that's our straight-line expense again.

88
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,240
Then we're going to compute the, in quotation marks,

89
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,620
interest expense.

90
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,270
Remember our beginning liability was $300 million.

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,890
The interest rate on the lease is 6%.

92
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,970
So we're going to compute the, in quotation marks,

93
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:43,090
interest expense as $300 million times 6%, which is $18 million.

94
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,560
And then we're going to compute the, in quotation

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,810
marks, amortization, or reduction in the lease asset,

96
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,360
as a straight-line expense of $22 million,

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,780
minus the interest expense of $18 million.

98
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,140
So the reduction in the lease asset is about $3.8 million.

99
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:12,710
Now once you see this, another way to do this--

100
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,030
and remember, before I say that, there's no amortization

101
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,900
expense here.

102
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,700
So the lease asset, unlike a finance lease asset,

103
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,970
we're not going to accumulate amortization.

104
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,990
We're just going to reduce the lease asset, the operating

105
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,750
lease asset, a little bit each year.

106
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,210
But we're not going to do it through an accumulated

107
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,705
amortization contra asset.

108
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:42,560


109
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,270
Now once we see that, an alternative

110
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,620
is to do just a single line balance sheet equation entry.

111
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,190
So again, the first thing we want to do, keep track of cash.

112
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,310
Cash goes down by about $22 million.

113
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,210
The lease expense is about $22 million.

114
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,020
The reduction in the lease obligation

115
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:12,210
is the lease payment of $22 million minus the $18 million

116
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,860
and in quotation, interest expense.

117
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,710
And then the reduction of the lease asset

118
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,110
is going to be the same as the reduction in the lease

119
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,870
obligation.

120
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,050
So our amortization expense, in quotation marks,

121
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,560
is going to be the straight-line expense of about $22 million

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,390
minus the interest expense of $18 million.

123
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,830
So again, that's two equivalent ways to do it.

124
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,400
Now let's look at this.

125
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,340
And again, there's no amortization expense.

126
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,890
Notice that there's no accumulated amortization contra

127
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,070
asset here.
