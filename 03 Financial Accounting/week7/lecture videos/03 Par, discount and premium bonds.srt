1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,870
PROFESSOR: Now we're going to talk about par bonds, discount

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,600
bonds, and premium bonds.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,750
So if at the time of issuance, remember the market interest

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,610
rate is bouncing around.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,920
But if it so happens that the market interest

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,040
rate is equal to the coupon rate,

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,020
then market value will be equal to the par value of the bond.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,810
Then we're going to call this a par bond,

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,950
or we're going to say that the bond sells at par.

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,280
Par is also known as face value.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,200
Sometimes, the market rate is higher than the coupon rate.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,550
If that's the case, then it'll be a discount bond.

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,100
And we'll see in a minute why that is.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,390
Sometimes, the market rate is lower than the coupon rate.

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,000
In that case, we'll call it a premium bond.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,530
And again, we'll see an example of that in just a minute.

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:04,129
So, for example, if you are buying a zero-coupon bond,

18
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,980
it had a par value of $1,000, which

19
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,570
means that sometime in the future,

20
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,960
it's going to pay you $1,000.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,340
And at the time, the market interest rate on similar debt

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,050
was 6%.

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,160
How much would you pay for the bond?

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,630
Would you pay $1,000 for the bond?

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,050
Would you pay more than $1,000 for the bond?

26
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,610
Would you pay less than $1,000 for the bond?

27
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,110
So remember, you're not going to get

28
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,870
the 1,000 for several years or some time now.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,440
So clearly, you'd pay less than this

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,250
because of the present value, or the time value of money.

31
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,010
Also, when you lend a firm money,

32
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,340
there's always the chance that the firm might go bankrupt

33
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,800
or default, in which case you would never

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,180
get your money back.

35
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,200
So you're taking a risk.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,410
And so you would pay less than $1,000 for this bond.
