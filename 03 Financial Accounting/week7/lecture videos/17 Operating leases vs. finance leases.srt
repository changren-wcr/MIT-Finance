00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
SPEAKER: And then we can look at a spreadsheet similar to what

1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,090
we looked at for finance lease.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,570
So we're doing this over 30 years.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,730
So column A is the year.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,490
Column B is the starting lease liability, the beginning

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,200
of this liability.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,840
We begin with a liability of $300 million.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,650
Then we add interest expense to that.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,840
That's column C. Then we subtract the payment from that.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,320
And that's how much principal reduction we have.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,080
And then that gives us column F, which

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,510
is the ending lease liability.

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,720
And then column G is essentially the same

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,800
as column E, which is the amortization or the reduction

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,510
in the lease asset.

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,530
And then that gives us column H in red, which

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,980
is the ending lease asset.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,740
So again, the two differences from the finance lease

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,340
are we're straight lining the lease expense.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,610
So the lease expense is the same every year,

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:08,660
as shown in column D, and that we're amortizing the lease

21
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,850
asset more slowly.

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,140
And that becomes clearest on this next picture here.

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,580
Whereas we saw with the finance lease obligation,

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:28,280
the lease obligation declines over time in a concave fashion.

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,210
So it declines more slowly at the beginning

26
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,770
and then declines more rapidly at the end.

27
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,070
But because the lease payment and the lease expense

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,240
are the same, because we force those things to be true,

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,300
the lease asset is also going to decline--

30
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,640
as shown in the green line there--

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,900
in that concave fashion.

32
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,530
So all the picture says, then, is

33
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,900
that the asset, the lease asset, amortizes at the same rate

34
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,180
as the lease liability.

35
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,479
And a question for you to think about is, does this make sense?

36
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,503
And another way to observe this is, what kind of depreciation

37
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:17,740
do we now have on the lease asset?

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,260
OK, notice the depreciation rate is slow at the beginning

39
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,030
and then faster toward the end.

40
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,920
So this is called decelerated depreciation.

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,010
And you remember from our earlier discussions

42
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,480
on depreciation, you would think that economic depreciation is

43
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,120
actually accelerated, so the asset

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,570
depreciates faster in its early years

45
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,950
than it does in its later years.

46
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,250
And again, we used the example of when you buy a car.

47
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,570
If you buy a car and then you drive that car home,

48
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,840
that car is worth only about 75% of what

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,880
you paid for it by the time you get home.

50
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,440
So there's very rapid accelerated depreciation

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,450
at the start of the asset's life.

52
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:14,090
So in order to get this straight line expense,

53
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,040
we're making an assumption that's

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,830
kind of silly about the depreciation of the leased

55
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,290
asset or the amortization of these assets.

56
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,100
But that's what you get in some sense

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,750
when you get politicians involved in economics,

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,640
or standard setting in this case.

59
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,410


60
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,540
So the difference, again, is with the finance lease,

61
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,430
the expense is in the red line.

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,130
So the expense starts high and then gets smaller over time.

63
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,500
Because interest expense is high at the beginning.

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,000
And as you pay off the debt, the interest expense gets lower.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,550
In the US, we have this contrived thing

66
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,940
where the operating lease is shown in the blue line.

67
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,190
The expanse is constant over time.

68
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,660
And as we said, that doesn't make a lot of sense.

69
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,790
But it's important to understand that to be

70
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,470
able to interpret what's going on in the financial statements.
