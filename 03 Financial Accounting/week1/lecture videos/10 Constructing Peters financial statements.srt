1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,140
PROFESSOR: So this obviously, again,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,350
has been done in PowerPoint.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,810
A better way to do these transactions

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,802
is on an Excel spreadsheet.

5
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:13,260
So you can imagine what we're going

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,650
to do now is add all these columns down.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,460
And you see that line there called

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,620
EB, which is Ending Balance.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,550
So when we add all these columns down,

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,180
what are we going to have?

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,910
We're going to have our balance sheet as

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,650
of the end of year one.

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,435
So let's add all the columns down.

14
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:39,020


15
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,370
And then, if you're like me, you want

16
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,220
to check that these columns actually add up to each other.

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,350
So that Total Assets in the Assets column is 46.

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,660
Liabilities is 20.

19
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,820
Stockholders' equity is 26.

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,430
Often, when you're doing this, you can make small mistakes,

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,360
and this is the double entry feature of the accounting

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,900
system is that when you form your balance sheet,

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,910
you will discover whether or not you have

24
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,020
any small mistakes in there.

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,370
And then you can look up above and correct them.

26
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,240
So just arranging this information now.

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,970
So EB, again, is our Ending Balance sheet.

28
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,170
And then, arranging this information,

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,470
this is the way that US companies

30
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,120
present their balance sheet, which

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,840
is Cash, which is the most liquid asset,

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,850
goes at the top-left.

33
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,170
Then you've got Accounts Receivable, less liquid assets.

34
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,730
In terms of liabilities, Accounts Payable,

35
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,820
which is your most liquid liabilities,

36
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,920
goes up at the top.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,050
You compute Total Liabilities, compute Stockholders' Equity.

38
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,830
Now, other countries-- and this is just a convention--

39
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,890
they sometimes will put the least liquid asset up on top.

40
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,310
So in this example, another country

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,280
might put Inventory on top and then

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,280
sort of cascade it down to Cash.

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,520
But clearly, the presentation is just a point of emphasis,

44
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,660
but it doesn't change any of the substance.

45
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,430
Having done Peter's company and having created a balance sheet,

46
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,790
now we're going to create the income statement and the cash

47
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,340
flow statement.
