1
00:00:00,555 --> 00:00:02,320
JOHN CORE: This is our first class.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,650
What we're going to do in this class

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,920
is briefly introduce the course, and then

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,140
introduce accrual accounting.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,880
My name is John Core.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,600
I'm a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,690
In terms of our course objectives,

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,110
we're training you to be leaders.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,070
We want you to understand accounting at a big picture

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,610
level, and this will help you reach your career

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:37,090
goals, either as a finance professional, or more broadly,

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,450
as an executive as you move out of the finance arena.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,170
We want you to understand the big picture of how accounting

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,180
information is prepared.

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,990
We're not training you how to prepare accounting information,

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,440
we want you to have that big picture knowledge

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,310
so that you can make informed decisions using accounting

18
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,000
information.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,880
And in order to do that, we're going

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,800
to introduce you to some of the rules, some of the language,

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,340
and some of the techniques.

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,450
We're going to try to help you recognize when managers using

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,690
accounting are using judgment, and then finally,

24
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,730
and most importantly, we're going

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,540
to help you apply accounting insights to real world

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,940
situations, again, as you would as a finance professional, more

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,610
generally as a business professional.

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,910
Briefly, MIT Sloan School's mission,

29
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,290
and when you come to MIT, when you come to the Sloan School,

30
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,230
you'll see this mission statement chiseled

31
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,990
in the wall of our main building.

32
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,940
Our mission is to develop principled, innovative leaders

33
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,990
who improve the world.

34
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,670
Many times in this course, we're going

35
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,380
to discuss examples in which firms or people are

36
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,230
manipulating accounting numbers.

37
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,870
The purpose of these examples is to help

38
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,920
you understand the role of judgment in accounting systems,

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,350
and that accounting systems give people leeway in which they can

40
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,530
manipulate numbers inappropriately,

41
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,220
or they can use that leeway to make better communication

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,940
decisions.

43
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,200
None of this, however, is to suggest

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,830
that the example behavior that we're looking at

45
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,910
is appropriate.

46
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,890
So please remember this as we go through the class.
