1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,990
PROFESSOR: Now, for the balance sheet equation,

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,090
I'm going to use the acronym for this,

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,300
BSE, balance sheet equation.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,580
So we got assets, what we own.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,830
We got liabilities, what we owe.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,510
And then we got shareholders' equity,

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,490
which is what the owners own.

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,230
And there's a lot of synonyms here.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,790
Shareholders' equity is sometimes

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,750
called book value, sometimes called net worth,

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,300
sometimes called residual claim, and we'll make

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,210
that clear in a second why.

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,740
So what this says is that assets equals liabilities

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,740
plus shareholders' equity.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,620
A equals L plus SE.

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,300
Now, a good way to think about this,

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,040
especially when you're starting off, is think about yourself.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,070
What kind of assets do you own?

19
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,730
Well, maybe you own a car.

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,310
And maybe, when you bought that car,

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,220
you took out a loan on that car.

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,490
And so your shareholders' equity on that car

23
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,550
is going to be the difference between the loan value--

24
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,150
I mean, the car value and the loan balance.

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,840
And that'll be your net worth.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
So that's the sense that stockholders' equity

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,530
or shareholders' equity is net worth.

28
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,100
Some more formal definitions here

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,840
of assets and liabilities--

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,370
assets-- there's three tests for an asset.

31
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,360
You have a right to ownership.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,200
So you own your car.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,090
Your car is associated with future benefits.

34
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,360
So it's not just a complete junker,

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,140
but you can drive that car around.

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,210
And the value of that car is measured

37
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,290
with reasonable accuracy.

38
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,600
So that's an asset.

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,790
Cases where assets are not thought

40
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,660
to be measurable with reasonable accuracy

41
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,890
is when you make investments in research and development.

42
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,160
Clearly, those investments have benefits,

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,090
but the accounting system doesn't think of those benefits

44
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,790
as being measurable with reasonable accuracy.

45
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,750
So we don't put-- in the US in particular,

46
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,650
we don't put any assets on our balance sheet

47
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,870
having to do with R&D investments.

48
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,900
So play with those definitions when you have a chance.

49
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,260
Liabilities-- also three tests.

50
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,410
It's a past transaction so that I've done something

51
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,850
to incur the liability.

52
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,510
So I borrowed money from you.

53
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,910
And it involves a future obligation.

54
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,200
In the future, I have to pay you money back or maybe I'll

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,230
deliver you a good or maybe I'll deliver you a service.

56
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,860
So those are two tests.

57
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,750
And then, again, notice here, there's

58
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,700
a measurable with reasonable accuracy test.

59
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,110
So most liabilities will be on the balance sheet.

60
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,120
The one liability that we've kind of

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,500
seen earlier today that won't be on the balance sheet

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,900
is if you're sued.

63
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,880
So if you're sued, there's a past transaction.

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,380
There's a future obligation.

65
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,110
You're going to probably have to pay out some kind of cash

66
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,580
or settle it otherwise.

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,950
But the accounting system says, that lawsuit is not

68
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,520
measurable with reasonable accuracy.

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,990
So that's not going to be a liability.

70
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,560
It'll be something called a contingent liability, which

71
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,410
will show up in the footnotes to our financial statements.

72
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,560


73
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,450
And then we want a definition of shareholders' equity.

74
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,420
So remember, shareholders' equity,

75
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,190
which I'm going to use the acronym SE,

76
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,900
is equal to the difference between assets and liabilities

77
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,980
just by the balance sheet equation,

78
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,820
which says assets equals liabilities

79
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,810
plus stockholders' equity.

80
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,490
So we can rearrange that to be stockholders' equity

81
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,810
equals assets minus liabilities.

82
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,570
And it says here that shareholders

83
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,510
are the residual claimant to the firm's assets.

84
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,110
And what that means is, if the firm liquidates or goes

85
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,820
into bankruptcy, we'll sell off all the assets

86
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,040
and we'll get some cash with the proceeds

87
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,360
of the sales of those assets.

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,770
And then we'll pay off all the liabilities.

89
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,500
And to the extent that there's anything left over

90
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,770
after we sell off all the assets and pay off

91
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,100
all the liabilities, we, the stockholders,

92
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,500
are the residual claimants of that.

93
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,590
We get what's left over.

94
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,600
And then just for accounting purposes,

95
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,200
we're going to divide shareholders' equity

96
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200
into something called contributed capital--

97
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,530
that's what happens when you issue stock--

98
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,910
and something called retained earnings,

99
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,060
which is what happens when you keep

100
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,260
your earnings within the firm.

101
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,980
So contributed capital, again, comes

102
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,660
from the issuance of stock.

103
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,870
Retained earnings are profits that we

104
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,030
haven't given back to our shareholders as dividends.

105
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,280
So that's a definition of assets, definition a liability,

106
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,180
definition of stockholders' equity.
