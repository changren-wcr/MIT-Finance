00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,110
PROFESSOR: So the last two slides in the slide deck

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,310
are things that I want you to sort of take a look at yourself

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,270
and think about.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,730
The first slide is about revenue,

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,540
and it shows that revenue can be recognized

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,690
at the same time we get cash.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,990
We can get cash before recognizing revenue.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,320
And we can get cash after recognizing revenue.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,770
So if you buy a hot dog from a street vendor,

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,920
you give the hot dog vendor cash,

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,130
and he's going to get earnings for that transaction.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,690
So that's just a cash transaction.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,070
Other transactions, like the deferred revenue transaction

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,560
that we saw in the Peters Company,

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,810
is we're going to get some cash ahead of time.

16
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,560
But since we haven't done anything for our customer yet,

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,510
we're going to have a liability for deferred revenue.

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,340
And then, in a subsequent period when we do that work,

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,920
the liability will go away.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,680
And then, at that point, we'll get retained earnings

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,840
from recognizing revenue.

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,760
Now, the final situation is we could get cash

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,530
after earning revenue.

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,980
And again, we've seen this as an example with Peters.

25
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,710
So we sell somebody something.

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,280
We've done the work, so the earnings process is complete.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,170
We know that we're going to collect cash

28
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,650
from this customer.

29
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,200
So we get revenue.

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,570
We recognize retained earnings.

31
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,950
But they give us an accounts receivable,

32
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,430
so we're not getting cash revenue.

33
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,680
We're getting credit revenue.

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,190
And then, in a subsequent period,

35
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,980
they're going to get rid of that accounts receivable

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,170
and pay us our cash.

37
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,030
So take a look at this slide and think about some examples

38
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,620
where you could fill in the slide with different examples.

39
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,710
Similarly, expense recognition-- because revenue recognition can

40
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,610
happen either at the same time as cash--

41
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,160
you could get cash before revenue recognition

42
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,880
or you can get cash after revenue recognition

43
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,920
because, by the matching principle,

44
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:32,090
we're recognizing expenses at the same period

45
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,120
as the associated revenue.

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,670
So again, if you pay your employees in cash when they

47
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,640
do the work, cash goes down.

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,170
You got wage expense.

49
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,260
If we rent a building ahead of time, we get a prepaid asset.

50
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,180
Cash goes down.

51
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,790
And it's not into the future, when

52
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,970
we use that building, prepaid asset goes away

53
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,870
and then we recognize an expense.

54
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,540
And then the final situation is like wages payable.

55
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,010
So the employees have done the work for us,

56
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,410
but we're not going to pay them until sometime in the future.

57
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,700
So we're not paying out any cash expenses.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,730
And then, sometime in the future,

59
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,330
we're going to pay our employees two weeks from now

60
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,140
or a month from now or whatever.

61
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,410
And at that point, we no longer have a wages payable

62
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,910
and we no longer have the associated cash either.

63
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,530
So this just sort of illustrates the way the accrual accounting

64
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,850
system works.

65
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,840
Again, I encourage you to take a look at these two slides

66
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,060
and think of some other examples,

67
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,670
examples you may be familiar with,

68
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,515
of revenue recognition and expense recognition.
