1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,660
PROFESSOR: So if we summarize our performance measures

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:10,710
for year 1, we had net income of $3,000.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,070
We had cash flow from operations or CFO of $8,000.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,030
And then what we call accruals or estimates

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,930
is the difference between net income minus cash

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,800
flow from our operations.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,440
So in our first year, we had negative accruals of minus 5.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,440
We're going to come back and talk about those accruals

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,400
in our next class.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,270
So one thing I want to point out to you before we

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,960
move on much further is we're using the balance sheet

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,350
equation.

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,760
So as we just saw, the balance sheet equation

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,000
for the transaction, the owners contributed $24,000 in cash.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,470
As we see, cash goes up as part of total assets.

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,110
And we see contributed capital goes up also $24,000 as part

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,070
of stockholders' equity.

18
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,550
Now, historically, accounts have used a journal entry system

19
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,150
that has debits or credits.

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,970
So the journal entry for the transaction--

21
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,800
the owners contributed $24,000 in cash--

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,390
was cash goes up.

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,380
It's a debit amount of $24,000.

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,080
And then contributed capital goes up.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,070
It's a credit amount of $24,000.

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,190
So this is an older system that you'll

27
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,690
see people using some days.

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,890
But notice that you can sort of map them directly

29
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,950
into the newer system that we're using.

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,650
The reason that we use our system, the balance sheet

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,200
equation, is the balance sheet equation

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,590
is very friendly with Excel spreadsheets.

33
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,570
And you can use an Excel spreadsheet

34
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,310
to do your accounting in a very transparent way, whereas if you

35
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,220
try to do this with a journal entry system,

36
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,690
it becomes more confusing.

37
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,360
So this is not on the exam.

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,759
We're going to be using the balance sheet equation system

39
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,860
throughout the whole semester.

40
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,230
But I do want you to understand that there

41
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,200
is this alternative system, which

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,190
is debits, credits, and journal entries as an aside.

43
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,530


44
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,740
Now, takeaways for this class--

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,250
so we started off by discussing some accounting definitions.

46
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,660
We introduce three fundamental accounting equations, so

47
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,380
our friend the balance sheet equation, the net income

48
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,970
equation.

49
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,820
And we also introduce the retained earnings equation,

50
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,100
which as you remember says beginning retained earnings

51
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,960
plus income minus dividends equals any retained earnings.

52
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,040
And then we came up with this idea of accrual accounting

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,610
that we're going to look at more deeply in

54
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,480
the next class or two.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,640
But the whole idea of accrual accounting

56
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,660
is we're trying to measure performance regardless of when

57
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,400
cash comes in or cash goes out.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,950
So over the course of this course,

59
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,540
we're going to use the balance sheet equation as our tool

60
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,910
to understand the impact of transactions

61
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,300
on financial statements.

62
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,480
And at this point in this class, please

63
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,560
practice some transactions, please do your homework.

64
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,670
You should be able to easily identify

65
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,850
what's an asset, what's a liability, what's

66
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,130
shareholders' equity.

67
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,800
And you want to become comfortable with accrual

68
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,580
accounting and comfortable with entering balance sheet

69
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,700
equation entries.
