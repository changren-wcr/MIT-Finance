1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,360
PROFESSOR: In terms of the consequences of our accounting

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,680
choices--

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,360
so we've made an inaccurate forecast.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,250
That's going to affect our earnings performance.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,960
That's going to affect our stock price.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,930
That's going to affect our volume, which

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,780
means how much of our stock gets traded,

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,120
our liquidity, again, which has to do with how

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,410
much of the stock gets traded.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,260


11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,460
In the United States, if you make a mistake on your earnings

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,030
forecasts, you can be sued.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,910
If you're a manager and you make a mistake on your earnings

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,830
forecasts and you get sued, that affects your reputation.

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,800
That may affect your compensation.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,690
And then we know, in the United States,

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,870
that CEOs have a shelf life about five years.

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,070
So from the time you begin as a CEO

19
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,780
to the time you are retired or fired as the CEO

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,800
tends to be about five years.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,160
And if you make a mistake like this,

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,600
that five years will be on the short side

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,030
rather than on the long side.

24
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,580


25
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,190
Now, let's look at the reaction of DreamWorks stock

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,270
to these lower than expected earnings.

27
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,270
Remember, we announced our earnings on May 10th.

28
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,620
The stock price fell about 14% that day.

29
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,660
There was a huge spike in volume that day.

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,360
And again, when the market learns of our earnings

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,300
shortfall--

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,010
minus 14% return.

33
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,550


34
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,450
Roughly 10% of our shares outstanding were traded.

35
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,090
That's five times the normal share volume.

36
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,610
And most uncomfortably, we lost $450 million

37
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,040
in market capitalization.

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,760
Market capitalization means, if you take the share price

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,790
and multiply it by shares outstanding,

40
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,950
that's also known as market value or market cap.

41
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,980
And then, finally, we got sued by six different shareholder

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,710
groups.

43
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,180
And getting sued is really bad if you're a chief executive,

44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,910
because even if you're innocent, it

45
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,090
takes lots and lots of your time going to court,

46
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,900
being deposed, sort of sitting around.

47
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,910
And all that time when you're sort

48
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,520
of dealing with these lawsuits, it's

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,440
time that you're not running your business.

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,110


51
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,570
So in terms of the takeaways from this mini case, Shrek

52
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,100
2 for DreamWorks, we see the market considers earnings

53
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,630
information to be important.

54
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,030
We see this trade-off between relevance--

55
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,500
we want to get shareholders' information soon--

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,090
versus reliability.

57
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,350
If we wait longer, we can get them better information.

58
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,030
But it's not as soon.

59
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,520
We see there's two types of accounting--

60
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,120
cash flows, which is when the cash comes in--

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,310
that's reliable but not relevant.

62
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,290
Then there's earnings, which are a combination of cash flows

63
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,170
and accruals.

64
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,840
And accruals are estimates of future cash flows.

65
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,175
So earnings are relevant but less reliable.

66
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:32,930


67
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,650
So there are accounting rules and there's

68
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,410
accounting judgment.

69
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,650
The rules say that we can record revenue

70
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,220
when we ship these DVDs.

71
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,460
Judgment is what management uses to figure out

72
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,940
how many of these DVDS will be returned.

73
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,370
This rookie management team in this early-stage company

74
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,930
used bad judgment.

75
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,290
They made a mistake here, and they're paying for it

76
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,670
with stockholders' lawsuits.
