00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,210


1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,520
PROFESSOR: How many assets does Peter's company have

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,975
at year zero?

3
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:05,670
It's got zero.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,710
It's got zero liabilities.

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,910
It's got zero stockholders' equity.

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,030
So this is a start-up.

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,330
And then, conceptually, its initial balance sheet

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,060
has no assets, no liabilities, and no stockholders' equity.

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,980
Our first transaction as a new company

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,370
is we're going to raise some cash from our contributing

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,080
stockholders.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,530
So cash is going to go up by $24,000.

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,080
So when you're doing these things,

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,270
always keep track of cash first.

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,860
So it's always easy to see what happened to cash.

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,450
Now we got to do something to balance the balance sheet

17
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,890
equation.

18
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,520
What would that something be?

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,870
Well, we sold some stock.

20
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,710
So then we know that that stock sale is going

21
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,050
to go into contributed capital.

22
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,440
And to make the balance sheet equation balance,

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,920
we're going to put 24,000 into contributed capital.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,110
Notice, for convenience here, I'm just dropping the zeros.

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,510
Now, our second transaction is we rented this warehouse

26
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,970
and we prepaid rent of $12,000.

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,410
So first of all, let's keep track of cash.

28
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,440
What happened when we prepaid this rent?

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,020
Our cash went down by $12,000.

30
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,320
Now, what do we want to do to balance the balance sheet

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,010
equation?

32
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:39,580
Prepaid rent, which is an asset, increased by $12,000.

33
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,820
Now, notice, there on the spreadsheet,

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,430
I've got a line item called 2A there,

35
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,770
which is something that happens during the year.

36
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:59,020
Now, if you prepay rent for a full year and the year goes by,

37
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,380
what happens to your prepaid rent?

38
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,760
It gets used up.

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,160
You no longer have an asset there.

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,210
So we prepaid two years of prepaid rent.

41
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,380
How much prepaid rent did we use up in the first year?

42
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,090
It'll be 6.

43
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,028
So our prepaid rent goes down by 6.

44
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:23,570
And then what are we going to do to balance the balance sheet

45
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,680
equation?

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,210
Well, with revenues and expenses, my motto is,

47
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,760
if in doubt, stick it into retained earnings.

48
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,060
So this is an expense.

49
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,280
It goes into retained earnings.

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,880
Notice that we used up $6 worth of our assets--

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,240
or $6,000 worth of our asset and that we

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,190
balanced the balance sheet equation

53
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,850
by having $6,000 worth of rent expense.

54
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,990


55
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,320
Now, our third transaction is that we're

56
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,250
going to buy inventory of $10,000 on account.

57
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,390
Now, because we're buying it on account,

58
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,270
we're not using any cash right away.

59
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,440
So cash is not going to be affected here.

60
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,460
Inventory is going to go up by $10,000.

61
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,318
So we got $10,000 worth of inventory.

62
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,860
And then what are we going to do to balance the balance sheet

63
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,820
equation?

64
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,670
So this-- we're buying it on account,

65
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,880
which means that we incurred an account payable for that.

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,380
So again, the balance sheet equation balance is there.

67
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,460
Now we've got our revenue transaction here.

68
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,840
And what I ask students to do here, please,

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,570
is split the revenue transaction first based on revenues.

70
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,540
And then, in transaction 4A, we'll

71
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,050
put any kind of costs associated with the revenues

72
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,340
or any kind of expenses associated with the revenues.

73
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,600
So we sold half of our inventory.

74
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,580
We got $20,000.

75
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,460
Always keep track of cash.

76
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,570
They also gave us an accounts receivable.

77
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,140
And then what is that?

78
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,510
That's going to be revenue.

79
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,050
So when in doubt, balance the transaction

80
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,950
by putting the difference into retained earnings.

81
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,990
Now we're going to think about what expenses were associated

82
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,970
with this transaction.

83
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,840
It says we sold half the inventory in 4A.

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,550
How do we reflect the fact that only half of our inventory

85
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,830
is still with us after this transaction?

86
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,300
So we're going to remove $5,000 worth of our inventory.

87
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,890
So half of it goes to this customer.

88
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,610
The other half is still with us.

89
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,470
And then we want to balance the balance sheet equation.

90
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,140
And again, when in doubt, stick it in retained earnings.

91
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:17,060
We got $5 COGS, and that's my acronym for cost of goods sold.

92
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,460
So that's the expense of selling that inventory.

93
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,380


94
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:32,090
Fifth transaction, we paid wages payable in cash of $6,000.

95
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,100
So keep track of cash.

96
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,840
Cash goes down by $6,000.

97
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,980
We accrued $4,000 of wages.

98
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,250
What's that going to be?

99
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,500
So we have a liability, a promise to pay our workers

100
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,470
$4,000 sometime in the future.

101
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,960
That's a wage payable.

102
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,920
Now, what do we do to make the balance sheet equation balance?

103
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,950
Again, this is going to be a wage expense.

104
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,160
And notice that we pay the workers $6,000

105
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,230
in cash, $4,000 in a promise to pay them in the future.

106
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,440
So our wage expense is going to be $10.

107
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,110
Now, notice, it's a little tricky to see at first,

108
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:23,730
but we've got assets go down by 6 and liabilities go up by 4.

109
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,820
Stockholders' equity goes down by 10.

110
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,610
So minus 6 in assets equals minus 6 in liabilities

111
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,885
plus stockholders' equity.

112
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:36,750


113
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,550
And then at transaction six, we enter

114
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,520
into a contract with Julie's company

115
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,890
to sell the remaining inventory next year in year two.

116
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:54,030
And Julie's company pays us $6,000.

117
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,110
So first thing we want to do here is keep track of cash.

118
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,900
So we get $6,000.

119
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,955
Now, is this revenue?

120
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,670


121
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,740
Think about our test for revenue.

122
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,230
Have we done the work yet?

123
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,610
No, we haven't done the work.

124
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,270
We're not going to deliver these goods until this time

125
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,680
next year.

126
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,910
This is what's called a deferred revenue.

127
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,780
To balance the balance sheet equation,

128
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,660
we're going to put this in deferred revenue, which

129
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,680
tells us, in some sense, we owe Julie's

130
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,740
company $6,000 worth of goods.

131
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,860
And when we deliver those $6,000 worth of goods

132
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,020
to Julie's company next year, then our deferred revenue

133
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,720
will become regular revenue at that point.

134
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,410
It's kind of like newspaper subscriptions.

135
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,020
Those of you that still subscribe to the newspaper

136
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,600
these days, at the start of the year,

137
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,360
you'll give The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal

138
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
or whatever $50.

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,310
And then over the course of the year, as they deliver

140
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,830
you your newspaper, that deferred revenue for them

141
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,770
gradually turns into regular revenue.

142
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,300
And as they give you all of your newspapers,

143
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,000
they no longer owe you any newspapers

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,500
as part of that subscription.

145
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,100


146
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,990
Final transaction-- and we're going

147
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,450
to come back and look at deferred revenue

148
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,900
quite closely in our next class when we

149
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,170
talk about revenue recognition.

150
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:38,120
In our final transaction, we paid a dividend of $1,000.

151
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,192
So if we pay cash to somebody, cash goes down.

152
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,400
What are we going to do in the balance sheet equation

153
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,690
to balance it?

154
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,660
If in doubt, stick it in retained earnings.

155
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,680
This is a dividend.

156
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,850
This is not strictly part of earnings

157
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,170
as in retained earnings.

158
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,500
This is a transaction with our stockholder.

159
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,000
