1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,790
PROFESSOR: A brief exercise--

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,640
this is a pretend company called the Peters Company.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,720
Now, at the top of the slide there is an important fact.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,600
So this company was only in business for two years.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,200
And during those two years, it entered into the following

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,500
transactions.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,980
So this is a startup.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,810
It's going to start up.

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,300
It's going to operate for two years.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,030
And then, as we'll see next class,

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,790
it's going to shut down and distribute

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,500
all its cash to its owners.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,550
So we're going to focus on year one in this class.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,200
So there are seven transactions in year one.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,920
First transaction, the owners contributed $24,000 in cash.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,650
And as you listen to these transactions,

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,160
try to think about how you would account for them using

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,740
the balance sheet equation, which is what we're

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,584
going to do in just a second.

20
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:04,120
Second transaction, at the beginning of the year,

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,210
we rented a warehouse for two years

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,740
and we prepaid that warehouse with a rent payment of $12,000.

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,910
So this is very much like when you rent an apartment

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,130
and you have to give a security deposit.

25
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,410
That security deposit functions as prepaid rent.

26
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,750
Third transaction, we purchased $10,000 of inventory

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,650
on account.

28
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,260
And what on account means here is

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,790
we're not giving our supplier $10,000 of cash when

30
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,500
we buy the inventory.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,750
We're giving our supplier an account payable,

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:50,530
which is a promise that someday we'll pay the supplier $10,000.

33
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,430
Then we actually engage in a revenue transaction.

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,930
We sell half the inventory for $24,000.

35
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,320
We get $20,000 in cash for that.

36
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,530
And then, instead of giving us cash,

37
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,020
our customer gives us an accounts receivable of $4,000.

38
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,870
So here the customer is saying, someday

39
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,590
we're going to pay you $4,000.

40
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,650
Fifth transaction, we paid wages of $6,000 and we

41
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,310
accrued wages payable of $4,000.

42
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,990
So that means that we owe our employees $10,000.

43
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:40,010
We directly pay them in cash $6,000, and we owe them $4,000.

44
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,900
And if you think in your own experience,

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,180
if you ever worked for a company that pays you every two

46
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,810
weeks, halfway in that two weeks,

47
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,750
that company owes you money.

48
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,910
So they've got an accrued wages payable to you.

49
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,580
And they'll pay that money to you

50
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,750
at the end of the two weeks, a week from now.

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,190
Sixth transaction, we entered into a contract

52
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,130
with Julies Company to sell the remaining

53
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,190
inventory in year two.

54
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,290
And as part of that contract, we got a $6,000

55
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,970
cash advance from Julies Company.

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,830
And then the final transaction that we're

57
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,010
going to look at in this class is that we

58
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:31,390
paid a dividend of $1,000.

59
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,745
So what we're going to do now--

60
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,490


61
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,540
here's a pretend Excel spreadsheet.

62
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,800
Obviously, we're doing this on PowerPoint.

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,000
But we've got some assets.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,560
We've got cash, accounts receivable, prepaid rent,

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,180
and inventory.

66
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,430
We got some liabilities.

67
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,360
We got A/P, which is accounts payable.

68
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,320
We've got DefRev, which is deferred revenue.

69
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,270
We got WPay, which is wages payable.

70
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,670
And then we've got our two stockholders' equity

71
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,240
components, which are contributed capital

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,670
and retained earnings.

73
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,310
So now what we're going to do--

74
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,220
for these seven transactions, we're

75
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,880
going to work through and go through these.

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,520
Now, we're doing this for year one.

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,080
But, at least theoretically, notice that Peters Company has

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,560
a balance sheet at year zero.
