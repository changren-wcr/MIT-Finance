1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,200
PROFESSOR: Now let's think about the income statement

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,240
equation, which says that net income equals

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,920
revenues minus expenses plus gains minus losses.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,980
We've already seen some revenues.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,740
So revenues are cash.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,580
So we sell these DVDS to Walmart.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,630
Walmart gives us our cash, so we got some cash revenues.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,070
Or they're claims to cash.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,120
So before Walmart gives us the cash, they've given us

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,760
and accounts receivable, which is telling us

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,225
that they owe us the money.

12
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:46,100
Revenues come from selling of goods or services.

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,910
Expenses are outflows of cash or outflows

14
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,920
of claims of cash that are incurred to generate revenues.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,320
So when we send those DVDS to Walmart, each of those DVD

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,940
costs us some money at some point.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,520
And so that cash that we put into building those DVDS

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,360
is the expense associated with selling those DVDs.

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,380


20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,960
And then, this is a little bit ahead of ourselves,

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,500
but gains are inflows of assets that

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,170
are not generated through the ordinary course of business.

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,930
So an example of this would be if we sell a building

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,130
and make a gain on it, our ordinary course of business

25
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,670
is not selling buildings.

26
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,390
But if we have a one-time sale of a building for a gain,

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,910
that's a gain.

28
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,530
Similarly, if we have a one-time sale of a building for a loss,

29
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,300
then that's a loss.

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,440
Right now, we're just going to simplify the income statement,

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,240
we're going to ignore the gains, we're

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,340
going to ignore the losses, and we're

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,025
going to focus on revenues and expenses.

34
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:03,090


35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,750
Now, we're going to link the income statement

36
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,560
and the balance sheet statement and the balance sheet

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,700
through shareholders' equity.

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,120
So as we just said, shareholders' equity

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,400
reflects contributed capital and retained earnings, and retained

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,620
earnings change as follows.

41
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,350
You've got some beginning retained earnings.

42
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,660
You add some net income.

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,760
You subtract a dividend.

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,800
That gives you your ending retained earnings.

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,320
So notice in that, net income is the difference

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,170
between revenues and expenses.

47
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,590
Revenues are going to increase retained earnings.

48
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,200
Expenses are going to decrease retained earnings.

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,890
So the retained earnings equation

50
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,520
links the balance sheet and the income statement together.

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,190


52
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,720
And then, having observed this, we can expand our balance sheet

53
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,020
equation, which is, again, Assets, A,

54
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:15,190
equals liabilities, L, plus Shareholders' Equity, SE.

55
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,710
Let's think of some examples of assets.

56
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:25,080
Well, there's cash, A/R, Accounts Receivable, INV,

57
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,950
Inventory.

58
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,900
So cash, accounts receivable, and inventory are all assets.

59
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:39,300
Liabilities are things like A/P, Accounts Payable, and bonds.

60
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,900
And then, we've already seeing that stockholders' equity

61
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,480
is contributed capital and retained earnings.

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,530
And as we just saw a minute ago, revenues

63
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,990
are going to increase retained earnings.

64
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,465
Expenses are going to decrease retained earnings.

65
00:03:54,465 --> 00:03:57,340


66
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,340
So with accrual accounting, we're

67
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,620
trying to measure firm performance

68
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,760
in a particular period.

69
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,860
So for firms, this will be a year or a quarter.

70
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,260
So we're going to measure firm performance

71
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,970
in a particular year, regardless of when we get cash from it.

72
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,649
And we'll have an example of this in just a second.

73
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,260
And intuition for revenue recognition

74
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,210
is have we done the work?

75
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,370
Have we earned the revenue?

76
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,000
Is our earnings process substantially complete?

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,240
So with Shrek 2, once we send that DVD

78
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,810
and once we know it's not going to be sent back to us,

79
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,760
the earnings process is substantially complete.

80
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,270
Second test of revenue recognition--

81
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,730
is cash collection reasonably assured?

82
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,590
So when we send the DVD to Walmart,

83
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,480
clearly, Walmart's going to pay us.

84
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,460
Walmart's a good credit.

85
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,830
But if we send the DVD to John's Discount Shop, maybe John's

86
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,450
Discount Shop, the cash collection is not assured.

87
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,910
And we'll see how we can modify the accounting

88
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:18,150
system to reflect these two differences

89
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,990
in the next class or two.

90
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,790
And then, expenses are easy.

91
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,960
So we have a matching principle for expenses.

92
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,730
So when we recognize revenue, we're

93
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,880
going to recognize expenses in the same period

94
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,350
as the associated revenue.

95
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,310
So that's accrual accounting.

96
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,070
We got a revenue recognition rule.

97
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,710
Is the earnings process complete?

98
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,470
Is cash collection assured?

99
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,970
And if so, we're going to match any expenses in the same period

100
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,250
as the associated revenue.

101
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,460
So an accrual is where we recognize revenue and expenses,

102
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,890
regardless of whether we've gotten cash for that or not.
