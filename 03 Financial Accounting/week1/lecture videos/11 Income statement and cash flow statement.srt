00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990


1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,110
PROFESSOR: So now we're going to create the income statement

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,660
and the cash flow statement.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,670
Then notice this picture.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,310
The balance sheet is something that

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,230
is a statement of what's happening at a point in time.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,070
So we've got a year zero balance sheet where

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,360
we had a bunch of zeros on it.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,510
We had a year one balance sheet that we just computed.

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,280
And in between those, what links the year zero balance

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,560
sheet and the year one balance sheet

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,290
is the income statement and the statement of cash flows.

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,330
And we're going to see how those links are made

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,050
in the next couple of minutes.

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,710
So here's our spreadsheet again.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,470
So we got ending balance at the bottom,

16
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,380
and we want to form an income statement.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,798
Where would we look for the income statement?

18
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:56,340
That's right.

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,990
So income is going to be part of changes in retained earnings.

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,170
So our income statement are going

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,260
to be all the changes in retained earnings

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,590
except for the dividend, because, again, dividends are

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,310
not part of income or expense.

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,730
So remember, we had some rent expense.

25
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,150
We had some revenue.

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,180
We had that cost of goods sold.

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,830
We had a wage expense.

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,220
So the way an income statement would

29
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,080
look using this information is that we got revenue on the top,

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,770
then cost of goods sold goes below that

31
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,280
and gross margin, which is just a term that means revenue

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,920
minus cost of goods sold, and then

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,110
we have our operating expenses, which

34
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,380
are rent and wage expense.

35
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,220
And then subtracting those off of gross margin

36
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:57,800
gives us our net income, which is $3,000 for the first year.

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,770
Now, the third statement we're going to look at here

38
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,830
is the cash flow statement, also known

39
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,490
as SCF, the statement in cash flows.

40
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,500
And what the cash flow statement tells

41
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,790
us is that we started with a certain amount of cash.

42
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,670
We finished with a certain amount of cash.

43
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,830
And the cash flow statement will tell us how that cash changed,

44
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,300
and it's going to group it into three different types of cash.

45
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,250
And we're going to discuss these in more

46
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,730
detail in a later class, but the three types

47
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:37,510
are operating, investing, and financing cash flows.

48
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:46,410
So where do we see our cash flow statement in this spreadsheet?

49
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,350
So again, we see cash.

50
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,990
We started with zero in cash.

51
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,300
We ended up with 31,000 in cash.

52
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,160
So that's right.

53
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,470
Our cash flow statement are going

54
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,410
to be all those changes in cash that

55
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,720
took place during the year.

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,660
And just as a reminder, remember,

57
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,120
there was a stock issuance.

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,770
We had some prepaid rent.

59
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,700
We had some revenue.

60
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,220
We had some wages.

61
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,320
We had some deferred revenue.

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,790
And we had a dividend.

63
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,960
So this is not important to know right now,

64
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,570
but we start with cash as zero.

65
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,720
We've got $8 of cash flows from operations,

66
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,160
which is the cash we collected from our customers,

67
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,640
the rent we paid, and the wages we paid.

68
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,580
We didn't have any cash from investment.

69
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,320
Cash from investment would be like

70
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,050
if we bought a building or something like that.

71
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,110
We'll cover cash from investment later.

72
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,410
And then we had quite a bit of cash from financing.

73
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,400
Remember, we raised money in our IPO, so to speak.

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,130
We raised $24,000.

75
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,500
And at the end of the period, we paid our dividend.
