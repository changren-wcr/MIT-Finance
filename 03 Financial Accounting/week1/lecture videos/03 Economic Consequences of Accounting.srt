00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690


1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,810
PROFESSOR: Now, think about it.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,830
Why do you think the investors or the stockholders

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,190
were concerned about this 25% earnings shortfall?

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,450
So one reason is that investors have

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,120
a mental model in which the stock

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,000
price is equal to expected discounted earnings.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,150
So the earnings expectations feed into the stock price,

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,410
where my E of earnings there means discounted expected

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,580
future earnings.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,100
Now, in your finance classes, you'll

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,130
learn that this is not exactly correct.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,170
What the stock price is is the present value of discounted

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,670
expected cash flows, E of cash flows there.

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,090
Why does the accounting for the sales of Shrek 2 DVDs matter?

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,930
Well, for one thing, earnings help predict future cash flows.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,260
And in fact, earnings are a better predictor

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,100
of future cash flows than our current cash flows.

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,010
So you can sort think of what happens

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,390
as earnings tell us something about future cash flows

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,120
and then future cash flows then tell us something

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,130
about the stock price.

22
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,220
And when earnings are lower, the stock price

23
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,370
is going to be lower because earnings are telling us

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,900
that future cash flows are going to be lower.

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,340
Now, what other or alternative approaches could

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,520
we use to account for the sale of a DVD?

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,960
Let's think of what's called the value chain.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,920
With a DVD, we make the DVD.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,650
That's the first stage in the value chain.

30
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,950
We ship it.

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,940
That's the second stage in the value chain.

32
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,900
And then we ship it to some retailers, say, like Walmart.

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,200
And if Walmart sells the DVD, he'll

34
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,390
send money to us at DreamWorks in, say, 60 to 90 days.

35
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,419
But if the retailer does not sell it,

36
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,400
the retailer has a right to return.

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,220
So the retailer's going to send the DVD back to DreamWorks.

38
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,120
So when you think about it, we could do our accounting

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,660
at any one of those three places in the value chain.

40
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,110
We could do it when we make it.

41
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,600
And some companies like Dell computer,

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,750
which have a really fast production process,

43
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,420
as soon as they finish building a computer,

44
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,920
they ship it to you, the consumer.

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,420
And so build-to-order companies actually do their accounting

46
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,550
as soon as they make it.

47
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,810
A second place so we could do it is when we ship it.

48
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,300
And then a final place we can do it

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,430
is we could wait for the retailer

50
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,980
to either send us our cash back or to return the DVD to us.

51
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,190
Now, where do you think that DreamWorks is actually

52
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,200
doing the accounting?

53
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,710
That's right, at shipping.

54
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,430
This is accrual accounting.

55
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,370
So at the time that DreamWorks ships the DVD,

56
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,350
they make an estimate on how many

57
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,020
DVDs are going to be returned.

58
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,270
And at that point, they do they're accounting

59
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,980
for the sale of the DVD.

60
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,990
Now, of course, they could wait until they get the cash,

61
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,070
and that would be called cash accounting.

62
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,160
We're going to focus on accrual accounting

63
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,030
in this class for reasons that will become clear

64
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,860
in just a minute.

65
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,520


66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,700
So how do you then think that DreamWorks accounts for the DVD

67
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,550
sales and the sales returns?

68
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,500
Well, again, we're doing accrual accounting.

69
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,470
So at the time we ship the DVDs, we know we shipped 100 DVDs.

70
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,810
We're going to make an estimate that, say, we're

71
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,280
going to get 30 DVDs back.

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,750
That'll tell us how much sales we have.

73
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,080
It'll also tell us how much earnings we have.

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,410
And this is called more relevant accounting

75
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,260
so that we're able, by doing this,

76
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,270
to tell our investors what our performance is sooner.

77
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,200
If we waited until the retailer sent cash,

78
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,600
that would be cash accounting.

79
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,330
It would be more reliable, but we'd

80
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,310
have to wait till the future till the dealer either sold

81
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,880
a DVD or returned the DVD to us.

82
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,720
So there's a trade-off here between relevance

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,370
and reliability.

84
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,850
We want to get our stockholders' information faster.

85
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,950
That's more relevant.

86
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,290
But that's less reliable.

87
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,120
We're more likely to make mistakes.

88
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,890
So final question, what are we estimating

89
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:07,170
here and what factors affect the accuracy of those estimates?

90
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,820
Well, clearly, when you think about what we're estimating

91
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,840
is how many DVDs are going to be returned.

92
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,130
So any DVDs returned, we're not going to be able to sell them.

93
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,540
Once we have an estimate of how many DVDs are returned,

94
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,150
we can estimate how much sales we make.

95
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,060
Those are the ones that are not returned.

96
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,490
And then we can estimate how much earnings

97
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,540
we're going to make.

98
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,645
That will be sales minus any other expenses.

99
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:38,550


100
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,640
In terms of the accuracy of this estimate,

101
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,250
the estimate's going to be more accurate

102
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,580
when the market's more stable and when the company has

103
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,440
a longer history.

104
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,830
Now, from reading the case, you know that DreamWorks just came

105
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,290
public in the last year or so.

106
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,700
So DreamWorks doesn't have a long history.

107
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,310
And you also know that this market

108
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,620
has had a lot of big changes in it

109
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,800
in the last six months or a year or so.

110
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,700
So all those things cause us to make an inaccurate forecast.
