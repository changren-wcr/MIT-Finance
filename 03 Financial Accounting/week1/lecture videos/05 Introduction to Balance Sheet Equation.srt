1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,540
PROFESSOR: So here's our agenda for the remainder

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,920
of this class.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,640
Main goal is to introduce to you the balance sheet equation

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,020
approach.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,760
This is a way for us to analyze the effect of a transaction,

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,070
say, like estimating expected returns in Shrek 2,

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,165
how that transaction affects a firm's financial statements.

8
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:29,790
And throughout the course, we're going to use the balance sheet

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,370
equation as our main tool.

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,000
We're also going to define some key concepts

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,340
of financial accounting.

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,940
So I'll give you a couple of definitions.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,500
And this is not a big deal.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,440
You'll be able, on a test or something,

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,860
to have access to these definitions.

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,360
And then we're going to practice how

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,240
to record some transactions, and we're

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,590
going to prepare some financial statements.

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,260
And all along, what we're doing is

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,840
introducing the mechanics of what

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,018
we call accrual accounting.

22
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:09,650


23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,090
So as an introduction, accounting

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,480
is the process of conveying information

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,660
to the firm's stakeholders.

26
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,350
So who are our stakeholders?

27
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,730
So you probably think of stockholders, debt holders,

28
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,390
creditors or people that own your debt, suppliers,

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,210
people that give you goods in exchange for credit,

30
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,110
employees-- why do employees care about your accounting?

31
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,360
Because employees have-- they want

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,810
to be paid by you over a long period of time,

33
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,750
and they want to make sure that your company is financially

34
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,890
healthy.

35
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,380
Customers for the same reason--

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,620
if you buy a Tesla from Elon Musk,

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,590
you want you want to know that Tesla

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,040
is going to be around for the next 5 to 10 years

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,600
to service your car.

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,990
And we can certainly think of other people, as well.

41
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,880
In terms of the types of information

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,250
that stakeholders want, this is just some terminology.

43
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,170
What does the company own?

44
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,310
So we're going to call those assets.

45
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,230
What does the company owe?

46
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,760
Well, what the company owes we're

47
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,160
going to call liabilities.

48
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,760
And then what do shareholders own?

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,470
We're going to call that shareholders' equity.

50
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,910
How did the company perform?

51
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,580
Well, we've seen one measure of this

52
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,650
already as net income or earnings.

53
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,960
Cash flow is another measure of performance

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,410
that we'll talk about later.
