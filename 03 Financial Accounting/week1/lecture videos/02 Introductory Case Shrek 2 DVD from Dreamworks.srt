1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,530
JOHN CORE: Now we're going to do an introductory case

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,450
on Dreamworks.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,850
It made a movie called Shrek 2, and then made a DVD about it.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,120
Dreamworks is special because it only makes two movies a year.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,780
So the revenues from this movie are

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,680
a big part of Dreamworks' operations for the year.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,770
Notice the green guy, this is the DVD box,

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,520
that's Shrek 2, if you don't know who he is.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,010
We're going to look at the economic consequences

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,130
of accounting through the Shrek 2 case.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,190
This is based on a Wall Street Journal article

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,910
from May 31, 2005.

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,960
The Shrek 2 DVD, says the reporter,

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:56,290
made a killing over the 2004/2005 holiday season.

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,760
Here's a timeline below.

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,140
So you see, over the holiday season,

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,000
so from Thanksgiving to early January,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,630
Shrek 2 made a killing.

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,160
Second case fact is at the beginning of 2005,

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,760
Jeff Katzenberg, who is the Dreamworks CEO,

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,340
was bragging a lot about all the records

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,160
that Shrek 2 had set in the DVD market,

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,450
or broken in the DVD market.

24
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,900
So there's our timeline again.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,200
In early January, they put out the statement bragging

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,890
about their records.

27
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,020
But as the first quarter ended, so Dreamworks,

28
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,530
like many American companies, has a fiscal year

29
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,560
that ends on December 31.

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,150
That means its first quarter ends on March 31,

31
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,390
and as this first quarter was ending,

32
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,790
Dreamworks started seeing retailers

33
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:59,000
returning millions of copies of the unsold copies of the DVD.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,890
So notice that this means that they're not

35
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,260
going to be selling these, because they're coming back

36
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,450
to them.

37
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:11,970
And then finally, on May 10, 2005,

38
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,320
Dreamworks issued its earnings announcement, and at that time,

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,310
it dropped a bombshell because its earnings fell short

40
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,730
of earnings forecast by 25%.

41
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,220
So you see again in the timeline,

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,850
we made a killing back in late December,

43
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,110
we bragged about it in January, we saw the DVDs

44
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,880
coming back to us in late March, and it wasn't until May

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,250
when we made our earnings announcement

46
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,920
that we told our stockholders exactly what was going on.
