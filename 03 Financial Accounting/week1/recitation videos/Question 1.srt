00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,890
PROFESSOR: In this section, we'll

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,220
cover some practice problems to familiarize yourself

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,720
with the BSC.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,110
We'll focus on the transactions made by a hypothetical company,

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,240
Brady's Lawn Care.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,500
Brady's Lawn Care was founded on January 1, 2009.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,980
The company's founder, Tom, provides ongoing maintenance

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,380
and gardening services for his clients

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,070
in the summer and snow removal in the winter.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,740
During the first fiscal year of operations,

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,670
Tom engaged in the transactions listed on the following pages.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,070
The first transaction, on January 1, 2009,

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,250
Tom issued 100,000 shares of common stocks

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,160
to friends and family for $15 each,

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,070
in order to raise money to start his business.

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,600
What actually transaction be?

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,330
Remember the basic balance sheet equations.

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,960
Assets equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,290
In this transaction, Tom raised cash, which is assets.

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,310
So in this transaction, since cash increased,

21
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,020
cash item increases by $15 times 100,000 shares,

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,830
which equals $1.5 million.

23
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,290
Since Tom raised cash by issuing common stock,

24
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,850
the corresponding $1.5 million increases in the shareholders'

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,170
equity side.

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,500
Common stock is a form of shareholders' equity.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,720
You can see the BSC holds, since assets go up by $1.5 million.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,240
And shareholders' equity correspondingly

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,990
increases by $1.5 million.
