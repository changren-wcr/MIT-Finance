PROFESSOR: Having established the basic concepts of what

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,980
balance sheet equation is about, let's

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,110
talk about a special example.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,680
Recall in transaction two Tom borrowed $100,000

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,640
from the bank.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,630
Cash increased by $100,000, and loans payable also

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,120
increased by $100,000.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,730
Now let's assume that on December 31st of 2009 and one

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,910
year passes since Tom borrowed the loan,

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,290
Tom records interest expenses that day but no cash payment

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,700
is made.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,100
What do you record?

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,260
First, you need to record interest expenses.

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,040
Interest expenses are recorded as expense,

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,500
and shareholders' equity decreases by $6,000.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,550
What will balance the decreases in shareholders' equity.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,430
Since Tom didn't make any cash payments yet,

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,710
liabilities would increase because interest

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,020
is what Tom owes to the bank.

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,930
The item accrued interests under liabilities

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,920
increases by $6,000.
