PROFESSOR: Transaction 3.
On the same day, January 1, Tom paid $500,000 in cash
for vehicles and lawn equipment.
How do you record the transaction?
Tom acquired vehicles, so equipment, which is an asset
account, increases by $500,000.
Since Tom paid for the equipment in cash,
cash decreases by $500,000.
BSE balances by one item in assets increasing
and another item in assets decreasing by the same amount.
