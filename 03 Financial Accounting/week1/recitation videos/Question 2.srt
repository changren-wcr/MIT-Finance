1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,150
PROFESSOR: The second transaction-- on January 1,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,050
Tom also borrowed $100,000 at 6% interest

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,170
from Independent Bank for some additional capital.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,180
Again, cash increases since Tom raised $100,000 in cash.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,390
And since he borrowed the cash from Independent Bank,

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,340
liabilities would increase.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,160
Liabilities, simply put, are something that

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,230
is borrowed from someone else.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,860
Therefore, cash increases by $100,000,

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,290
and loans payable, correspondingly,

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,170
increases by $100,000.

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,010
The BSC balances out.

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,090
Some people may be confused with the 6% interest rate.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,260
We will deal with bond-issuance transactions in future lectures

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,840
and recitations.
