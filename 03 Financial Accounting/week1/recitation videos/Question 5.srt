00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850


1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,910
PROFESSOR: Transaction five, on April 21st,

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,330
Tom billed his clients for the spring planning services

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,580
totaling $300,000.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,960
Tom had used $75,000 worth of plants and other supplies

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,329
for these services.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,410
It looks like Tom made a revenue.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,640
He delivered his spring planning services in cash.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,810
Collectability is reasonable since he builded his clients.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,390
Because Tom didn't receive cash yet,

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,250
accounts receivable increases by $300,000.

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,920
Correspondingly because revenue increases

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,370
retained earnings, which is a shareholders' equity account,

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,900
retained earnings increases by $300,000.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,420
During the course of generating his revenue,

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,980
Tom used $75,000 worth of plants and supplies for his service.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,490
As per the matching principle, this cost

17
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,400
is incurred as revenue is recognized.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,390
Inventory decreases by $75,000 and retained

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,010
earnings decreases by $75,000, because cost of goods sold

20
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,730
increased by that amount.
