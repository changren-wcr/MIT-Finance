00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,030
BRIAN: Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,660
Welcome to the first recitation of financial accounting.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,330
My name is Brian, and I'll be leading the recitations

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,590
in this course.

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,440
Recitations are meant to review lecture materials for better

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,840
understanding of the accounting concepts

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,490
and prepare students for the problem sets.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,490
So what is the main goal of this class?

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,460
The main goal is to learn how to use relevant accounting

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,920
information to make better business decisions.

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,110
The goal is not to make you accountants

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,950
and to prepare financial statements from scratch.

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,870
Before we get into the main concepts,

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,970
I'd also like to share some tips for this course.

15
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,150
First, put some extra effort at the beginning

16
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,220
to understand key concepts.

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,800
Rather than blindly memorizing, understanding

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,480
why these concepts exist is critical.

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,930
Second, take advantage of your recitations,

20
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,610
and use your time wisely.

21
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,000
Third, homework and practice-- reviewing and practicing

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,940
problem sets and problems solved in the recitations

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,870
will get you a long way.

24
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,840
So in this first recitation, we'll

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,550
review the following concepts--

26
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,100
accrual accounting and financial statements,

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,010
recording transactions using the balance-sheet equation,

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,900
and practice some problems.

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,510
Let's first discuss financial statements.

30
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,940
What components are there in a set of financial statements?

31
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,590
First, there is a balance sheet.

32
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,010
This is a snapshot of the financial position

33
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,150
of a business.

34
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,880
If you went to Facebook and looked at their bank account

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,650
on December 31, 2013, how much cash would they have?

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,170
What were the value of their buildings?

37
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,740
Balance sheet provides information to these equations.

38
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,590
The second component is the income statement.

39
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,200
Income statement records accounting performance

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,680
of a company over a certain period of time-- a quarter

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,510
or a year, typically.

42
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,390
An example would be, what was Facebook's revenue

43
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,970
during the year 2013?

44
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,010
What was Facebook's expenses?

45
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,990
Was Facebook profitable?

46
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,450
Income statement can answer these questions.

47
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,420
The third component is the Statement of Cash Flows.

48
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,420
This records, over a period of time,

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,910
the sources and uses of cash.

50
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,770
Did Facebook generate enough cash

51
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,710
to cover its expenses during 2013,

52
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,270
would be an example of a question

53
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,970
that Statement of Cash Flows can answer.

54
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,550
The final component is the stockholders' equity,

55
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,380
or shareholders' equity.

56
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,960
This records the changes in shareholders' equity

57
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,170
in the company.

58
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,540
What is interesting about these four components

59
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,450
is that each component within the financial statement

60
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,020
is linked to each other.

61
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,660
Let's see how these are related.

62
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,940
As you can see in this chart, Balance sheet

63
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,610
is the parent statement, and all three other statements

64
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,150
flow to the balance sheet.

65
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,560
Statement of Cash Flows records the inflows and outflows

66
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,710
of cash and drives the final cash at the period end.

67
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,620
This final cash number flows to the cash item

68
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,740
in the balance sheet.

69
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,490
Income statement records revenues and expenses

70
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,980
and drives the bottom-line net-income number.

71
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,950
This net-income number flows to the statement of stockholders'

72
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,380
equity, and the statement of shareholders' equity

73
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,680
produces the final shareholders' equity number, which

74
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,810
then flows to the shareholders' equity item

75
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,970
in the balance sheet.

76
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,000
The important equations used in the financial statements

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,370
are called balance-sheet equations.

78
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,360
In this course, we're going to have four main equations that

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,770
are frequently used to derive important accounting numbers.

80
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,120
First, assets equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity.

81
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,970
As mentioned in the lecture, assets are what a firm owns,

82
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,720
liabilities are what a firm owes,

83
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,990
and shareholders' equity is the firm's net worth, or owners'

84
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,850
share of the business,

85
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,810
Second, net income equals revenues minus expenses

86
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,970
plus gains minus losses.

87
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,150
Revenues are something the firm earned by selling the firm's

88
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,280
product or services.

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,670
Expenses are something the firm spent to generate revenues.

90
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,550
Gains are financial inflows that are

91
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,730
generated not through the firm's ordinary business.

92
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,070
Losses, on the other hand, are outflows

93
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,730
that are not generated through the firm's ordinary business.

94
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,950
Third, ending cash equals beginning

95
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,630
cash plus net-cash flow.

96
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,810
And finally, ending retained earnings

97
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,140
equals the beginning retained earnings plus net income

98
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,210
minus the dividends.

99
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,879
We will study what these equations mean in a few slides.
