00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890


1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,530
PROFESSOR: Another important basic concept of accounting

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,470
is the concept of accrual accounting.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,860
Accrual accounting essentially records financial transactions

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,040
based on revenue recognition and matching principles.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,940
For example, when a firm sells a product and the customer

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,060
pays with the credit card, cash is not exchanged,

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,810
but the firm still can incur the transaction as revenue.

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,440
On the contrary, cash accounting records transactions only

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,600
when cash is exchanged.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,630
In cash accounting, the sales made

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,020
using a credit card will not be recorded as revenue

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,320
until the firm receives the sales amount in cash

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,270
from the credit card company.

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,980
In this class, we will focus on accrual accounting.

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,020
Let's solve an example.

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,340
Ted's apartment costs $1,000 each month to rent.

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,040
He decides he doesn't want to worry about forgetting

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,260
to pay his rent, and pays his landlord

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,230
$12,000 for the upcoming year.

20
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,700
Under cash accounting, how much expense would be incurred?

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,430
Ted paid $12,000 in cash already.

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,840
So the expense is $12,000.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,920
Under accrual accounting, how much expense?

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,830
Accrual accounting recognizes expense only

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,930
when the service is provided.

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,680
In this case, the service is the time Ted actually

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,600
lived in the apartment.

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,450
And this question, assuming he lived in the apartment

29
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,290
for a month, Ted's expense is $1,000.

30
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,990
We will get to the revenue recognition concepts

31
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,250
in the next slide.

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,280
Which is more accurate?

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,810
I'll leave this up to you to think about.

34
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,720
To reiterate the exact definition of accrual

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,820
accounting, accrual counting attempts

36
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,850
to measure firm performance in a particular method

37
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,250
regardless of when cash is exchanged.

38
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,220
In accrual accounting, there are two main principles,

39
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,480
revenue recognition and matching principle for expenses.

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,820
Accrual is essentially the recognition

41
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,580
of revenues and expenses, regardless

42
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,280
of when cash is received.

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,610
The intuition behind revenue recognition

44
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,280
and matching principle is fairly simple.

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,980
To recognize revenues, earnings process

46
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,950
must be substantially complete, meaning,

47
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,860
the revenue should be earned in cash collections

48
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,020
should be reasonably assured.

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,570
For matching principle, you recognize

50
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,520
expenses in the same period as the associated revenue.

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,460
Let's discuss the concepts in a bit more detail.

52
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,040
Revenue recognition deals with the issue,

53
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,860
when do we exactly recognize revenue,

54
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,660
and when do we define when a sale is made in accounting.

55
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,100
The revenue recognition intuition

56
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,560
says that the revenue is recorded

57
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,780
when the earnings process is substantially complete.

58
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,470
Note that this definition makes no mention

59
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,960
of when the cash is collected.

60
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,530
Under accrual counting, we can record revenues and expenses,

61
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,540
even if no cash changes hands.

62
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,610
Matching principle deals with the issue

63
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,000
when to recognize expenses in a given period as

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,160
opposed to revenues.

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,230
The matching principle states that we

66
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,830
should match all expenses to their associated revenues.

67
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,710
In other words, whatever cost that's incurred

68
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,380
to create a revenue, will be recognized

69
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,060
once the revenue is realized.

70
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,280
Note that this definition requires

71
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,240
us to match all expenses associated with revenue,

72
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,730
both those that have occurred and those

73
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,580
that will occur in the future.

74
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,110
This requires estimating future expenses.

75
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,950
Why do we do this?

76
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,000
We do this to make financial statements more timely,

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,390
and to obtain better measures of profitability.

78
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,480
We now discuss each component of financial statements

79
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,710
more thoroughly.

80
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,980
First, the balance sheet, within the balance sheet

81
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,010
we find three classifications, assets, liabilities,

82
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,560
and equity.

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,810
Within each of these classifications,

84
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,480
we have separate accounts.

85
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,460
On the right, is a sample of balance sheet of a company XYZ.

86
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,740
Each line represents a line item,

87
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,970
or accounts of the balance sheet some items represented here

88
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,400
are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses

89
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,350
and so on.

90
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,660
We will learn more about each item as the course progresses

91
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,940
I've mentioned the balance sheet equation briefly

92
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,840
a few slides ago.

93
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,340
What is the balance sheet equation or the BSE.

94
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,760
BSE is a method of recording individual transactions

95
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,020
or events.

96
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,810
BSE helps to identify the accounts that

97
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,260
are affected, whether the accounts increased or decreased

98
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,000
by a certain amount.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,130
One important thing to remember is

100
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,850
that the equation must always balance at all times.

101
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,100
If the equation does not balance,

102
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,890
you probably made a mistake somewhere.

103
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,380
Let's go over some possible scenarios

104
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,080
how BSE can balance out.

105
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,810
Remember, assets equals liabilities,

106
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,000
plus shareholders' equity.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,800
First, let's assume one item in the assets have increased.

108
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,520
To balance this out, one of three classifications

109
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,680
must be affected, assets, liabilities, or equity.

110
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,310
If some other item in the assets was affected,

111
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,830
that other asset item would have decreased

112
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,850
by the corresponding amount.

113
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,160
On the other hand, if assets increase and liabilities

114
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,460
or equity was affected, then liabilities or equity

115
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,520
would have increased.

116
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,700
With the same logic, if assets decrease by a certain amount,

117
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,930
there's some other item and assets would have increased,

118
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,880
or liabilities or equity would have

119
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,390
decreased by the same amount.
