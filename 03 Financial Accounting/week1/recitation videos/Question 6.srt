00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,270
PROFESSOR: Let's sum up the five transactions together.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,210
The final cash number after the five transactions

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:13,090
is $800,000, accounts receivable, $300,000,

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:20,440
inventory, $225,000, equipment, $500,000.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,290
As for the liabilities, Tom has a loan

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,240
payable of $100,000, which he received from Independent Bank.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,490
In shareholders' equity, the common stock he issued

8
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,930
didn't go away.

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,990
So $1.5 million remained intact.

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:43,940
Tom made $300,000 in revenue with a cost of $75,000.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,480
So net he increased retained earnings by $225,000.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,900
Notice that the numbers at the bottom in the blue box

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,620
are basically the numbers used to create the balance sheet.

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,140
On the other hand, the red box represents

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,250
transactions or items that are used for the income statement.

16
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,040
Let's discuss a little bit further

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,250
how exactly we should build the financial statements

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,290
for these transactions.

19
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,260
For the income statement, we begin with the top line

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,940
revenue.

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,630
Recall that Tom made $300,000 in revenue

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,300
and used $75,000 to incur that revenue.

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,930
In other words, he used $75,000 as Cost of Goods Sold or COGS.

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:35,260
Netting COGS from revenue leaves him with $225,000.

25
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,110
The profit after subtracting COGS from revenue

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,600
is called gross profit.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,200
In this scenario, Tom did not incur any other expenses.

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,230
Therefore, there is no other expenses

29
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,030
incurred in this example.

30
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,700
Therefore, the final net income equals the gross profit,

31
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,610
which is $225,000.

32
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,770
Now let's look at the balance sheet.

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,290
Again, assets are what a company owns,

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,950
liabilities are what a company owes,

35
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,400
and equity is the share of what the shareholders have.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,420
Under assets, there is a list of what the company owns,

37
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,000
cash of $800,000, inventory of $225,000,

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,330
accounts receivables of $300,000,

39
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,660
and equipment of $500,000.

40
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,072
Its total assets is $1.825 million.

41
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:34,840
These assets are composed of liabilities and equity.

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,960
Total liabilities is $100,000 from the loan

43
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,300
Tom borrowed from the bank, and the rest

44
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,100
is shareholders' equity.

45
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,800
Within shareholders' equity, common stock

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,860
is $1.5 dollars million and retained earnings $225,000.

47
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,700
So the total equity is $1.725 million.

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,150
Let's see if the BSE holds.

49
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,290
Assets equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity.

50
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,140
Total assets is $1.825 million, and liabilities plus equity

51
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,320
is $1.825 million as well.

52
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,380
BSE holds.
