PROFESSOR: The second transaction-- on January 1,
Tom also borrowed $100,000 at 6% interest
from Independent Bank for some additional capital.
Again, cash increases since Tom raised $100,000 in cash.
And since he borrowed the cash from Independent Bank,
liabilities would increase.
Liabilities, simply put, are something that
is borrowed from someone else.
Therefore, cash increases by $100,000,
and loans payable, correspondingly,
increases by $100,000.
The BSC balances out.
Some people may be confused with the 6% interest rate.
We will deal with bond-issuance transactions in future lectures
and recitations.
