1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,050
PROFESSOR: Let's look at operating efficiency.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,540
Define inventory turnover as cost

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,830
divided by ending inventory.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,550
Sears ending inventory turnover is 26,231 divided

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:19,490
by 5,335, which is 4.92.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,060
Assume that Sears uses LIFO.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,590
Would inventory turnover be higher or lower under FIFO?

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,080
In order to solve this question, we

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,049
need to look at each component comprising the inventory

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,490
turnover.

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,700
First, what is the effect on COGS?

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,780
Under normal circumstances, this means rising prices.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,690
So using FIFO would have lower COGS than using LIFO.

14
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,060
On the other hand, ending inventory value

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,700
would increase if FIFO is used.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,020
Therefore, using FIFO would result in a lower inventory

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,570
turnover.
