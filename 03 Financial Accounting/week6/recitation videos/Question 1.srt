00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:02,310
INSTRUCTOR: In the next couple of slides,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,210
we'll cover some practice problems,

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,650
use the following definitions, unless otherwise

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,760
stated, to solve the problems.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,700
Leverage is total liabilities over total shareholders'

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,110
equity.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,290
Current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,410
Net margin is net income divided by revenue.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,910
Gross margin is revenue minus COGS divided by revenue.

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,340
ROA is net income divided by total assets.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,750
ROV is net income over shareholders' equity.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,710
And asset turnover is revenue over total assets.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,060
Note that all balance sheet items use ending values.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,090
Question 1, Ratios and BSE entries.

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,420
For each transaction, record the balance sheet equation

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,420
and state how the transaction would change

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,170
financial statement ratios.

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,090
The firm accrued bad debt expense of 12,000.

19
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,239
For our BSE, allowance for doubtful accounts

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,560
increases by 12,000, which is a contra asset account.

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,830
Retained earnings decreases by 12,000

22
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,200
since it's a bad debt expense.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,050
How would this affect the ratios?

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,930
For current ratio, current assets decrease,

25
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,490
and therefore, current ratio decreases.

26
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,310
There's no change in current liabilities.

27
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,940
Return on assets also decreases because net income is lower

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,030
and assets is also lower by the same amount,

29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,870
but since ROA is less than 1, subtracting

30
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,320
the same values for denominator and numerator

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,730
would result in a lower value.

32
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,970
Finally, leverage ratio increases

33
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,580
because retained earnings decreases

34
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,260
but liabilities do not.

35
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,900
Second question, sold property, plant, and equipment,

36
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,220
which cost 20,000, and had accumulated depreciation

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,550
of 14,000 for $5,000 in cash.

38
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,830
Cash increases by 5,000, PPE decreases by 20,000,

39
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,560
and accumulated depreciation also decreases by 14,000.

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,050
Retained earnings also decreased by 1,000

41
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,830
because there's a loss on sale.

42
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,870
For the leverage ratio, this transaction

43
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,680
increases leverage because shareholders' equity decreases

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,890
while there's no change in overall liabilities.

45
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,100
Current ratio also increases because cash increases

46
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,030
by 5,000, but there's no change in current liabilities.

47
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,100
Net income decreases because there's

48
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,340
a 1,000 decrease on retained earnings coming

49
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,820
from loss on sale.
