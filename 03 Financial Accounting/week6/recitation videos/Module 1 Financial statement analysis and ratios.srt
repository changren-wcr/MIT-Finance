PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,750
Welcome to recitation 6 of the financial accounting

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,480
course.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,050
In this recitation, we'll cover financial statement analysis

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,840
and go over various financial ratios.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,620
In particular, we'll study liquidity and solvency ratios,

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:22,410
profitability ratios, efficiency ratios, and DuPont analysis.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,140
There are three commonly used types

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,140
of ratios for a financial statement analysis.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,920
First, there's liquidity and solvency ratios.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,720
These ratios can answer the question,

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,370
does the company have the ability to pay its bills?

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,450
Firms with higher liquidity and solvency ratios, in general,

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,970
have higher cash or assets that could be easily liquidated.

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,620
Profitability ratios show how profitable a firm is.

16
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,690
Firms with higher profitability earn

17
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,470
more profit per assets or revenues generated.

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,830
Finally, efficiency ratios show how efficient

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,230
a firm is managed.

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,720
We'll go over examples of each types of ratios

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,960
in the next few slides.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,230
Let's go over some formulas for each type of ratios.

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,290
First, for liquidity and solvency ratios,

24
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,860
leverage ratio and current ratio are most common.

25
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,340
Leverage ratio, sometimes called debt to equity ratio,

26
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,370
is total liabilities over total shareholders' equity.

27
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,360
This ratio shows how much a firm is levered.

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,430
The current ratio is current assets

29
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,100
over current liabilities.

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,600
This ratio shows how much current liquid assets

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,660
are available, as opposed to current liabilities.

32
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,780
The higher this ratio is, the more comfortable

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,950
a firm will be repaying current liabilities.

34
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,580
Let's take a look at profitability ratios.

35
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,890
First, let's look at the margins.

36
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,040
Net margin is net income over total revenue.

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,420
This shows how much net income a firm can generate per revenue.

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,880
Gross margin, on the other hand, is

39
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,910
calculated as revenue minus COGS over revenue.

40
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,490
In other words, it's gross profit over revenue.

41
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,860
This measures the gross profit generated per revenue.

42
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,860
On the other hand, return on investment

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,900
usually deals with return on assets or return on equity.

44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,980
ROA is measured as net income over total assets.

45
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,010
ROE is net income over total shareholders' equity.

46
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,530
Both measure how much net income could be

47
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,460
generated per assets or equity.

48
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,710
What about operating efficiency?

49
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,290
These ratios are relatively less straightforward.

50
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,440
First, accounts receivables turnover

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,100
is the revenue over net accounts receivable.

52
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,000
Higher credit sales but lower accounts receivable balance

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,670
would imply that the firm has collected cash pretty quickly.

54
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,640
Inventory turnover is calculated as cost of goods

55
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,010
sold divided by inventory.

56
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,140
High COGS and low inventory would

57
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,140
imply that the firm has pretty quick turnover

58
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,550
of your inventory, which is a good sign.

59
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,180
Finally, days receivable is 365, which

60
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,560
is the number of days in a year, divided by a cash receivables

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,150
turnover.

62
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,210
This measures the average number of days

63
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,680
the receivables is outstanding before it's collected.

64
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,590
Before we get into any of the example questions,

65
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,380
let's briefly review the changes in ratios

66
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,330
and how they're calculated.

67
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,770
Calculating how a transaction would change the ratios that we

68
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,370
would learn here is important, and will show up frequently

69
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,760
in problem sets and exams.

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,970
The first step when determining how a ratio would change

71
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,520
is to check what your initial ratio is.

72
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,640
Whether it's above or below one.

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,820
Then check whether a transaction you're analyzing

74
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,440
will affect the denominator, numerator, or both.

75
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,840
For example, if leverage is 3 over 2 or 1.5,

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,779
and the firm issued both debt and equity $1 million each,

77
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,870
the ending leverage will be 4 over 3

78
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,460
by adding 1 to the denominator and 1 to the numerator.

79
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,060
Therefore, this transaction would decrease

80
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,930
the original leverage ratio.
