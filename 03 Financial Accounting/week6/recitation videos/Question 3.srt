00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,320
PROFESSOR: Question 1 is on temporary differences.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,340
Part A-- ABC Company buys new production equipment,

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,010
costing $10,000.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,060
The equipment has a 10 year useful life and no salvage

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,550
value.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,040
Under current tax rules, the machinery

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,400
may be fully depreciated in a year.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,270
Suppose that ABC Company generates revenues up

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,890
of $50,000 and has expenses of $30,000.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,750
Assume a tax rate of 30% and a straight line depreciation

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,150
method for accounting purposes.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,340
What's the effect on deferred taxes?

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,990
Express this in the balance sheet equation.

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,660
In order to assess what the deferred taxes would

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,970
be in this situation, we first need

16
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,050
to obtain depreciation expenses for both accrual accounting

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,580
and tax accounting.

18
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,760
Calculating depreciation expenses for accrual accounting

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,250
is fairly straightforward, assuming a straight line

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,090
depreciation method.

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,960
Cost of $10,000 with no salvage value

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,550
and a useful life of 10 years give us a depreciation expense

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,950
of $1,000 a year.

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:14,140
For tax purposes, depreciation expenses $10,000 in year 1.

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,660
The question tells us that the machinery

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,120
is fully depreciated in year 1.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,010
So we used the forecast as depreciation expense in year 1.

28
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,930
This difference in timing results

29
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,380
in ABC Company recognizing a lower taxable income

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,390
for tax purposes.

31
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,400
For both accounting methods, we have

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,260
$50,000 in revenue, $30,000 in operating expenses.

33
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,170
The depreciation is $1,000 and $10,000

34
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,440
for accrual accounting and tax accounting, respectively.

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,850
Therefore, using tax accounting lowers the earnings

36
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,720
before taxes, or EBT, by $9,000.

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,310
This $9,000 times 30%, which is the tax rate,

38
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,960
equal to $2,700, which is the lower amount of taxes

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,340
paid in the current period, but needs to be paid in the future.

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,360
Therefore this $2,700 number is deferred tax liability.

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,380
How do we express this with the balance sheet equation?

42
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,890
First, we know that we pay $3,000 in cash

43
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,060
to the IRS in this period.

44
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,860
So cash decreases by $3,000 we also

45
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,410
know that from book income, tax expense is $5,700.

46
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,370
The difference of $2,700 increases DTL

47
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,590
and balances the BSE out.

48
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,500
Part B-- what would happen next year?

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,470
The year after, tax expense for book accounting

50
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,040
remains the same, because the firm employs a straight line

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,110
method over 10 years of useful life.

52
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,540
For tax accounting purposes, however,

53
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,770
since the asset was fully depreciated in year 1,

54
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,550
there's no depreciation expense to report.

55
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,940
Year 2 EBT for book accounting is $19,000,

56
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,910
which is the same as year 1's EBT,

57
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,700
whereas year 2 EBT under tax accounting

58
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,410
is $20,000, which is now higher than the book income.

59
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:21,340
Assuming the same 30% tax rate, $300 of DTL will reverse.

60
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,350
To express this using the BSE, cash decreases by $6,000,

61
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,350
because cash taxes paid is $6,000.

62
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,680
Retained earnings decreases by $5,700

63
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,380
to account for the book accounting tax expenses.

64
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,920
The difference of $300 decreases the DTL

65
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,790
we originally had in the books.
