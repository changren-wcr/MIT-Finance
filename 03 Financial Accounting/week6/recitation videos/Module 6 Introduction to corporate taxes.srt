PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,940
Welcome to recitation 6 of the Financial Accounting course.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,360
In this recitation, we'll cover income taxes.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,960
In particular, we will cover temporary tax differences,

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,660
such as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, how

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,120
to account for these income taxes, and effective tax rates.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,950
Before we get into the specifics,

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,550
it is important to cover some basic distinctions related

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,230
to income taxes.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,540
First, pre-tax income is generated

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,570
under accrual based revenue recognition principle-- i.e.

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,830
GAAP.

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,520
This is what we have seen for a regular revenue recognition

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,330
process, which we have covered in previous classes.

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,210
Taxable income is income before taxes generated

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,760
using the tax code this is typically

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,740
different from accrual accounting income,

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,470
and it's more similar to cash accounting.

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,680
Cash taxes are taxes paid to the IRS,

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,900
as determined by the tax code.

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,760
This is tax from the taxable income.

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,720
Finally, tax provision is tax expense

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,090
recorded in the financial statements, which

24
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,690
is based upon GAAP income.

25
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,750
It is important to understand that taxable income does not

26
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,180
equal pre-tax or book income.

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,810
As briefly mentioned, book income uses accrual methods,

28
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,980
and tax income uses methods more similar to cash accounting.

29
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,040
The difference risen from the different methods

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,470
may be permanent or temporary.

31
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,410
Permanent differences include penalties and fines,

32
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,950
municipal bond treatments, and stock compensation.

33
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,930
Temporary items involve differences

34
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,130
in depreciation calculations, deferred revenue, and so on.

35
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,030
In this recitation, we'll focus on the temporary differences.

36
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,480
Temporary book tax differences will eventually be made equal.

37
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,400
However, business cycles may make

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,230
this process take a long time.

39
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,240
US GAAP has a different set of rules

40
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,180
for recognizing revenue and expenses, which

41
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,290
is accrual based, than the tax code, which is cash based.

42
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,530
As we have seen before, much of a difference between accrual

43
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,870
based system and a cash based system

44
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,800
is in the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,010
Temporary book tax differences arise primarily

46
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,170
as a result of these timing differences.

47
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,330
For example, under US GAAP, when a firm purchases PPE,

48
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,900
it depreciates the asset gradually over time,

49
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,410
whereas the tax code that allows for immediate and accelerated

50
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,880
depreciation.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,500
We will go over this in more detail in the following slides.

52
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,980
Temporary tax differences can cause the tax provision

53
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,860
which, is the expense reported on the income statement,

54
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,280
to vary from actual cash taxes paid.

55
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,230
Accrual based accounting requires

56
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,410
companies to report these differences, using accounts

57
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,820
that we refer to as deferred tax assets, or DTAs,

58
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,210
and deferred tax liabilities, DTLs.

59
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,720
We can think of a DTA as prepaid taxes.

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
DTAs are recorded when cash taxes

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,040
paid are higher than the tax expense.

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,330
We can think of a DTL as unpaired taxes.

63
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,940
DTLs are recorded when cash taxes paid

64
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,690
are lower than the tax expense.
