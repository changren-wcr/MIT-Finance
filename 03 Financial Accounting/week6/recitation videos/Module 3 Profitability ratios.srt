1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,320
PROFESSOR: Now let's calculate profitability ratios.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,660
Let's first look at the net margin.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,010
For Walmart, net income is $8,039 million.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:16,660
And revenues is $246,565 million.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,270
Since that margin is net income over revenues,

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:26,312
the net margin for Walmart in 2003 is 3.26%.

7
00:00:26,312 --> 00:00:32,940
Sears's net margin is $3,397 million divided by $41,124

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,190
million, which would give us 8.26% for Sears's.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,330
Net margin.

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,610
ROE, on the other hand, is calculated

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,910
as net income divided by ending total shareholders' equity.

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,520
$8,039 divided by $39,337--

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,316
ROE for Walmart will be 20.43%.

14
00:00:57,316 --> 00:01:00,550
Using the same calculation, Sears's ROE

15
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:11,730
is $3,397 divided by $6,401, which equals to 53.07%.

16
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,860
Walmart's ROE was 20.43% in 2003.

17
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,100
In 2003, how would the following transactions affect its ROE?

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,460
In 2003, Walmart paid a dividend.

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,210
In this case, ROE would increase because net income is not

20
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,190
affected, but shareholders' equity decreases.

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,690
If Walmart wrote off receivables, what would happen?

22
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,750
ROE is unaffected because write-offs would not

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,650
affect net income and equity.

24
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,940
If Walmart sold one factory and gained $2,000 on sale,

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,590
what would happen?

26
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,530
ROE would increase because net income would increase,

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,390
and shareholders' equity would also

28
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,220
increase by the same amount.

29
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,820
Since ROE is smaller than 1, the same amount increase

30
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,870
in denominator and numerator would result in an overall ROE

31
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,120
increase.
