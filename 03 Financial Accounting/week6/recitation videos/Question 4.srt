00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,200
PROFESSOR: Question 2-- more taxes.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,500
Refer to Pfizer's tax footnotes to solve

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,760
the following questions part A-- what is Pfizer's 2009

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,780
effective tax rate the footnote tells us

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,140
at the bottom row the ETR for Pfizer

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,970
is 20.3% Part B-- what is the major reason

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,260
why Pfizer's effective tax rate is different from the US

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,280
statutory rate of 35%?

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,580
The biggest difference against the statutory rate

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,080
stems from earnings taxed at other than US statutory rate.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,400
This decreased ETR by 9.3 percentage points.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,190
Part C-- assume that in 2010, Pfizer

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,150
reports book depreciation of $20,000 in millions,

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,810
like the financial statements, and tax depreciation

15
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,670
of $40,000.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,710
What is the effect of this transaction

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,060
on Pfizer's deferred tax liability for 2010?

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,030
As statutory tax rate of 35% for this question.

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,540
Book depreciation was $20,000, and tax depreciation

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,840
was $40,000 this would tell us that tax income is

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,140
lower than book income.

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,290
And this tells us that Pfizer will have

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,900
to pay more tax in the future.

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,190
Therefore, DTL will increase by 20,000 times

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,850
the tax rate of 35%, which we assumed

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,990
in this question, or $7,000.
