1
00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:01,820
PROFESSOR: Then how do we account

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,610
for these deferred tax assets and liabilities?

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,710
First, let's take a look at DTAs.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,730
DTAs arise when tax income is larger than book income.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,190
This result in higher cash taxes paid

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,060
than the accounting tax expense or provision for income taxes.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,240
One common example of this is deferred revenue.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,950
We learned in revenue recognition class

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,070
that deferred revenue is not recognized

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,330
as revenue or pre-tax income for accrual counting purposes.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,400
But in tax accounting, deferred revenue

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,040
is recognized as taxable income.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,650
This ultimately leads to higher taxes.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,070
The difference, hence, becomes DTA.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,550
How will this look like on the balance sheet equation?

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,510
Let's say a firm paid $100,000 in taxes in cash.

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,310
But for book purposes, the tax expense was only $80,000.

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,960
The $20,000 difference becomes the DTA.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,390
Deferred tax liabilities, or DTLs,

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,230
are almost an exact opposite to DTAs in many aspects.

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,040
DTLs arise when tax income is lower than the book income.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,290
And therefore, cash taxes paid is lower

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,630
than accounting tax expenses.

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,630
An example of DTLs is depreciation.

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,180
And accrual accounting, one of the most commonly used

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,970
depreciation methods is straight depreciation.

27
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,960
However, in tax accounting, accelerated method

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,420
is most commonly used, suggesting

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,210
that at least in the early years of PPE,

30
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,790
accounting depreciation expense would be lower

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,220
than actual cash taxes paid.

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,530
Therefore, this results in lower taxes

33
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,840
paid than the tax expense.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,880
The difference is the DTL.

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,720
In terms of BSE, if accounting tax expense was $100,000

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,750
and cash taxes paid is $80,000, DTL increases by $20,000

37
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,360
to accommodate the differences.

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,180
Where exactly would you see deferred tax assets

39
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,370
or deferred tax liabilities?

40
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,950
Typically, these are located in the footnotes section

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,900
of the balance sheet, as seen in this example.

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,500
It is not unusual to see both DTAs and DTLs in a firm,

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,980
how is income taxes represented in the income statement?

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,800
Again, let's look at the tax footnotes.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,160
In the footnotes section, there separately as an item provision

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,960
for income taxes.

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,780
In this example, how much was GAAP provision

48
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,320
for income taxes.

49
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,900
The last row tells us it's $428 million.

50
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,060
This is also reflected in the income statement

51
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,800
under the same name.

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,580
Where can we find the actual taxes paid for 2012?

53
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,810
How much taxes do they need to pay for this year?

54
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,110
Under the term current taxes, $693 million

55
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,630
is recorded for 2012.

56
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,040
Current taxes represent the cash taxes paid for the year.

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,230
How much taxes are deferred?

58
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,260
Under the row, deferred taxes in the footnotes,

59
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,830
we see $265 million recorded as deferred taxes.

60
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,120
Note that cash taxes paid, which is current taxes, $693 million,

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,660
are higher than the provision for income taxes, which

62
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,610
is for $428 million.

63
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,430
We're seeing deferred tax assets in this case.

64
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,270
What transactions did they record?

65
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,550
We mentioned that cash taxes paid for this year, or year

66
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,420
2012, is $693 million.

67
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,140
Therefore cash decreases by $693 million.

68
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,660
We've also shown that the tax provision was $428 million.

69
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,990
So retained earnings decreased by that amount.

70
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,730
To balance these two out, DTA increases by $265 million.

71
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,690
DTA is an item in the assets.

72
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,000
The footnotes provide a detailed description--

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,380
on detailed description on DTA and DTL.

74
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,720
The balances shown in the left reflect

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,670
the difference between GAAP provision

76
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,060
and the taxes actually paid to the IRS.

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,030
These are cumulative, since they are balances.

78
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,120
In this example, what was the aggregate difference in taxes

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,560
recognized under GAAP and paid for deferred revenue in 2012?

80
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,380
Under the row, deferred revenue, $129 million

81
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,200
is reported as deferred revenue.

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,390
Another question would be, what difference

83
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,230
in recognized revenue led to this DTA?

84
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,160
In order to answer this question,

85
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,070
we need to assume what the tax rate might

86
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,170
have been for this firm.

87
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,820
Let's say the tax rate is 30%.

88
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,520
$129 million, which is the deferred tax

89
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,910
assets, divided by the tax rate of 30%, is $430 million.

90
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,730
This is the difference in the recognized revenue.

91
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,480
Another aspect of income taxes is valuation allowance.

92
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,250
To provide a background for this,

93
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,700
notice that DTAs act like prepaid assets.

94
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,540
And we need taxable income to offset the DTAs.

95
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,690
If a firm keeps making losses under the tax accounting

96
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,610
definition, DTA would not be exhausted.

97
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,980
Precisely for this type of situation,

98
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,200
if management does not think the company

99
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,210
will have enough future taxable income

100
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,880
to be able to use all the DTAs, then

101
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,810
a contra asset must be established against the DTAs.

102
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,890
This contra asset account is called the valuation allowance.

103
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,320
Valuation allowance can be also found in the footnotes.
