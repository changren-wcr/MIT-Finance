PROFESSOR: Second question.

1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,510
Below is a basic financial information

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,320
for CVS for fiscal year 2016.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,700
Conduct DuPont analysis for fiscal year 2016.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,820
US ending total assets and ending shareholders' equity

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,980
for leverage ratio.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,190
Recall the DuPont formula net margin times

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,520
asset turnover times leverage equals ROE.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,830
So beginning with the profit margin or the net margin,

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,010
profit margin is $5,317, which is the net income, divided

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,140
by $177,526 revenue.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,470
And this is 3%.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:49,860
Asset turnover is $177,526 divided by $94,462.

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,710
And this equals 1.88.

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,750
Finally, leverage equals $94,462 divided

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,940
by $36,834, which is 2.56.

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,970
Multiplying these three ratios together,

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:15,930
3% times 1.88 times 2.56, we'll get the ROE of 14.40%.
