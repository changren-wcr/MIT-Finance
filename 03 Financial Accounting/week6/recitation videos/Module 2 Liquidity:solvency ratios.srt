00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,720
PROFESSOR: Let's solve some example questions.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,150
Let's take a look at Walmart and Sears back in 2003.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,030
Suppose at the end of fiscal year 2003,

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,910
Walmart and Sears had the following balance sheet

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,840
numbers.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,910
What would the current ratio and leverage

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,920
ratio for Walmart and Sears be?

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,520
First, let's calculate Walmart's current ratio.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,900
Current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,830
Walmart's ending current assets and current liabilities in 2003

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:41,450
are at 30,483 million and 32,617 million respectively.

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,300
Dividing the current assets into current liabilities

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,540
would give us 0.93.

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,720
Sears's current ratio on the other hand, current assets

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:59,400
is 18,196 billion, and current liabilities is 13,759 million.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,640
So the current ratio is 1.32.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,170
What about the leverage ratio?

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,590
Leverage ratio is defined as ending total liabilities

19
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,200
over a total shareholders' equity.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:20,980
55,348 million is divided by 39,337, which equals 1.41.

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,300
Sears leverage ratio is 3.33 since total liabilities

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,360
and shareholders' equity for Sears in 2003

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:37,950
is 21,322 million and 6,401 million respectively.

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,160
We've calculated Sears debt to equity ratio or the leverage

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,350
ratio in 2003.

26
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,830
Now in 2003, how would Sears leverage ratio

27
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,370
change if the following transactions were done?

28
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,840
First, what if Sears paid more dividends in 2003?

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,990
Leverage would increase since shareholders' equity would

30
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,660
be lower.

31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,560
But liabilities would not have been affected.

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,990
What if Sears writes off more receivables in 2003?

33
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,460
Debt to equity or leverage wouldn't

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,280
change, since write offs doesn't affect liabilities

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,980
and shareholders' equity.

36
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,290
What if Sears issued $1 billion of long-term debt?

37
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,610
Leverage would increase because liabilities would increase

38
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,990
following the $1 billion issuance of long-term debt,

39
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,970
but shareholders' equity wouldn't change.

40
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,270


41
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,090
What if Sears issued $1 billion in long-term debt and $1

42
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,820
billion of stock in 2003?

43
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,200
Leverage would decrease.

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,770
Recall the changes in the ratio slide a couple of slides back.

45
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,380
Since Sears leverage is greater than 1,

46
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,810
and both numerator and denominator

47
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,780
increase by the same amount, the leverage ratio would decrease.
