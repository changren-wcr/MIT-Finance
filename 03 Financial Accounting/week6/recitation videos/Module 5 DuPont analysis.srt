INSTRUCTOR: Our next topic is DuPont decomposition.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,370
DuPont analysis decomposes ROE into ratios of solvency,

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,920
profitability, and efficiency.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,980
Using this analysis helps us to analyze

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,650
what aspect of the business is doing a good job.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,930
First, recall that ROE is net income divided by equity.

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,500
Second, we could rewrite the first equation

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,600
to net income divided by assets times assets over equity.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,330
This is equivalent to ROA times leverage.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,050
Going a step further, we could rewrite the equation once again

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,110
to net income divided by sales times sales

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,840
divided by assets times assets divided

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,280
by shareholders' equity.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,940
This is profit margin times asset turnover times leverage.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,450
Note here that leverage is defined as assets over equity,

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,490
not liabilities over equity.

17
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,990
Be sure to check the exact definition for each ratio

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,200
when solving problem sets or exam questions.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,690
The definitions will be given to you there.

20
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,770


21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,520
Let's go back to the Walmart and Sears example.

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,390
Walmart's ROE is 20.4% and is comprised

23
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:28,870
of net margin of 3.26%, turnover of 2.6, and leverage of 2.41.

24
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:34,120
On the other hand, Sears ROE is 53.1%, which

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,850
is higher than Walmart's ROE.

26
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,420
Now let's decompose this and see what

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,260
exactly is triggering Sears's ROE to be higher

28
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,770
than Walmart's ROE.

29
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,820
Sears's is net margin is 8.26% and has

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,060
an asset turnover of 1.48 and a leverage of 4.33%.

31
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,110
What are the differences here?

32
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,470
Sears's net margin is much higher,

33
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,420
indicating higher profitability, and asset utilization

34
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,669
or asset turnover is lower.

35
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,360
And Sears also has a higher leverage than Walmart does.

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,050
In other words, Sears's business in 2003

37
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,270
was more profitable but probably less solvent.

38
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,720
Hence, Sears has a higher ROE than Walmart.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,390
What happens is Sears pays out cash dividends

40
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,560
at the end of the year.

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,510
First, assets decrease because cash goes down.

42
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,690
Equity also decreases because retained earnings goes down.

43
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,130
Therefore, asset utilization or asset turnover

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,460
increases, and leverage also goes up.

45
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,450
Finally, ROE increases using all these changes

46
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,500
that were in play.

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,000
