PROFESSOR: Second question.
Below is a basic financial information
for CVS for fiscal year 2016.
Conduct DuPont analysis for fiscal year 2016.
US ending total assets and ending shareholders' equity
for leverage ratio.
Recall the DuPont formula net margin times
asset turnover times leverage equals ROE.
So beginning with the profit margin or the net margin,
profit margin is $5,317, which is the net income, divided
by $177,526 revenue.
And this is 3%.
Asset turnover is $177,526 divided by $94,462.
And this equals 1.88.
Finally, leverage equals $94,462 divided
by $36,834, which is 2.56.
Multiplying these three ratios together,
3% times 1.88 times 2.56, we'll get the ROE of 14.40%.
