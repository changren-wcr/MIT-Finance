00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,555
PROFESSOR: In this section, let's

2
00:00:01,555 --> 00:00:03,180
look at effective tax rates.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,190
The formula for effective tax rate

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,850
is tax expenses divided by GAAP pre-tax income.

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,280
Effective tax rate, or ETR, tries

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,310
to capture the true tax burdens of a firm,

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,190
rather than US statutory rate of 35%, as of 2017.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,880
The difference between ETRs and the statutory rate

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,860
can arise from different reasons.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,510
But to name a few, first, there are items recognized by GAAP

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,720
but not the tax code, i.e. the permanent differences

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,120
between book accounting and tax accounting,

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,440
interest received on tax exempt bonds, such as municipal bonds

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,130
or fines paid to government and associated legal expenses

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,720
are some examples.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,480
Second, differences in tax rates on foreign earnings

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,130
can be a major factor.

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,670
Many firms operate in different jurisdictions or countries.

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,000
And different countries have different corporate tax rates.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,360
Third, revaluation of DTA and DTL

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,340
due to tax rate changes, and finally stock compensation,

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,370
are all examples of sources of different ETRs

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,480
and statutory rates.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,630
Let's look at Amazon's income statement

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,310
to see where we can obtain effective tax rate information.

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,170
Under the income statement, there's

27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,750
the row income before income taxes.

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,370
And this represents the book income before taxes.

29
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,330
In 2012, it was $544 million.

30
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,600
Provision for income taxes represent the tax expenses

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,050
under a book accounting, and the number in 2012

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,430
was $428 million.

33
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,420
Dividing for $428 million by $544 million

34
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,490
gives us 78.6% of income taxes.

35
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,370
Is this really possible?

36
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,850
Under footnotes, firms explain how their effective tax

37
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,570
rates are different from the statutory rate.

38
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,930
For Amazon, the impact of foreign tax differential

39
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:09,289
boosted ETR by 31.5 percentage points, with other factors.

40
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,680
Specifically, losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,610
for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily

42
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,480
generated by subsidiaries located outside of Europe,

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,600
reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,710
our effective tax rate.

46
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:36,040
So yes, an effective tax rate of 78.5% can really happen.
