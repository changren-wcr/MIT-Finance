1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,730
PROFESSOR: So now we're going to talk about the effective tax

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,660
rate.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,370
And the definition is at the top of the slide.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,780
So the effective tax rate is tax expense

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,390
divided by GAAP pre-tax income.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,010
And this is something that's very controversial, as we'll

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,300
see later in this section, because often companies

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,610
are going to have a lower effective tax

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,760
rate than the GAAP's statutory rate.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,900
And people in the press and other activists

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,040
will complain that that's a sign that the firm is

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,420
paying too less in taxes.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,750
So the effective tax rate can differ

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,900
from the US statutory rate, which was 35% in 2017.

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,670
And examples of why are permanent differences, which

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,870
are things that are recognized by GAAP but not by the tax

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,680
code.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,980
So if you've ever bought a tax exempt bond,

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,370
you'll get interest income on those bonds,

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,440
but that interest income will not

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,540
be taxable by the US tax authority.

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,500
So there will be a difference between your interest

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,260
income for your financial reporting books

24
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,890
and your interest income for your tax books.

25
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,090
Another example is if you are caught doing something

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,770
like Goldman did.

27
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,210
Goldman was accused of mortgage securities fraud.

28
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,170
They paid a $10 billion fine to the government.

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,420
And it doesn't make sense, when you think about it,

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,080
for the government to allow fines to the government

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,650
to be tax deductible.

32
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,200
So fines to the government, if you

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
have to pay a fine to the government,

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,550
it's not tax deductible.

35
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:50,200
But it is an expense on your financial reporting books.

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,170
So that's again, another reason for why

37
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,860
your financial reporting income, in this case,

38
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,560
will be different than your taxable income.

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,680
Another big reason is historically

40
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,800
US multinationals have paid lower taxes when they make

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,230
investments outside the US.

42
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,470
And those lower tax rates cause differences

43
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,930
in the effective tax rate.

44
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,120
And then, as we just talked about,

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
when their tax rate changes, this

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,930
is going to cause a revaluation of our deferred tax assets

47
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,640
or our deferred tax liabilities that could cause extra expense

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,220
or extra income, but that's not going

49
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,250
to be reflected on our tax books.

50
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,890
And then finally, we'll do an example

51
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,030
towards the end of the session of stock compensation,

52
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,170
as something that gives rise to permanent differences

53
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,320
and differences in the effective tax rate.

54
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,170
So when we look back at Goldman, this

55
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,050
is Goldman's income statement for 2016.

56
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,460
If we compute their effective tax rate,

57
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,370
we take their provision for taxes of $2.9 billion

58
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,190
and divide that by their pre-tax income of $10.3 billion,

59
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,710
we get an effective tax rate of 28%,

60
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,950
versus the US statutory rate of 35%.

61
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,140
So all companies will have a chart in their income tax

62
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,130
footnote that looks like this, where at the top of it,

63
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,760
it will show the US statutory rate, which was 35% in 2016.

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,690
At the bottom, it will show the effective tax rate that we just

65
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,570
computed on the slide.

66
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,510
And in the middle of the table, it

67
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,280
will show you reasons why the effective tax

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,800
rate is different than the US federal statutory rate.

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,210
So in Goldman's case, there was about a 7% lower tax

70
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,740
rate, because Goldman had foreign earnings or non US

71
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,230
earnings, and these non US earnings

72
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:18,070
were taxed at a lower rate than the US tax rate.

73
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,250
Second thing is I mentioned a minute ago,

74
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,560
in 2015 Goldman paid a big fine.

75
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,460
But that fine, although it was an expense for book purposes,

76
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,140
it was not deductible for tax purposes.

77
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,890
So that caused a big 10.2% difference in the effective tax

78
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,100
rate in 2015.

79
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,590
Now just as a reminder, this is sort

80
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,750
of setting up our discussions coming up, in 2018,

81
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,860
the US cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

82
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,150
And then this chart gives you a sense of the rates

83
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,410
at of other major countries that the US trades with.

84
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:17,550
So the 21% rate is a little lower than France, Australia,

85
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,230
and other countries.

86
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,770
But it's higher than say like the UK and Germany

87
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,720
and other countries.

88
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,420
So the rate is arguably about in the middle of the rates of non

89
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,990
US countries.

90
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,560
And so this was a big corporate tax

91
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,310
change that was enacted in December of 2017.

92
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,570
And again, the headline result was

93
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,390
it lowered the US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%,

94
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,090
beginning in 2018.

95
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,120
But there were offsets.

96
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,870
And one of the big offsets is that previously

97
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,350
earned foreign income.

98
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,930
So if Goldman had income in say Europe or something like that,

99
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,740
and that income was taxable at a lower rate,

100
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,400
under the old tax system, Goldman

101
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,080
would not pay US tax on that foreign income

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,270
until it brought that income back

103
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,330
to the US, which is called repatriation.

104
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,350
And what Goldman and other firms would do

105
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,550
was just never repatriate that income.

106
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,960
So their income tax on that non US income

107
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,620
was permanently lower than the income tax

108
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,780
they would pay in the US.

109
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:45,350
But the new tax law said that income is deemed repatriated,

110
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,990
which means we're going to assume that it was brought back

111
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,490
into the US, and it is immediately taxable at US tax

112
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,310
rates.

113
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,880
So now we're just going to scroll forward a year.

114
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,630
So we've been looking at Goldman Sachs's income tax

115
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,180
footnote for 2016.

116
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,940
Now we're going to look at it 2017.

117
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,590
Look at their effective tax rate in 2017.

118
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,240
It's 62%.

119
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,630
So it more than doubles from 2016 to 2017.

120
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,680
And then it's interesting to see why that is.

121
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,490
Well a big part is just what we talked about a minute ago.

122
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,470
Goldman had all this income in non US countries.

123
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,910
All that income was deemed repatriated and taxable.

124
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,280
So all the years that Goldman had

125
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,180
paid lower taxes in non US countries,

126
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,120
that just immediately reversed.

127
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,880
And that had a big 30% increase in their effective tax rate

128
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,890
as a result of that.

129
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,950
Other big thing that happened, and this

130
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,890
is what we were talking about a couple of minutes ago,

131
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,430
is Goldman had a net deferred tax asset.

132
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,720
The rate went from 35% to 21%.

133
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,280
That caused that net deferred tax asset to decrease in value.

134
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,060
And that caused Goldman's income tax expense to increase,

135
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,960
as we just illustrated.
