1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,440
So as takeaways for class, this class,

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,070
we introduced financial statement analysis and ratio analysis.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,220
So this is a huge topic.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,680
I wanted to give you an introduction to it.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,740
You'll find that it's really, really useful.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,170
One of the uses of this is that in professional settings,

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,990
many people are paid bonuses based

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,860
on their financial performance, their return on equity,

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,000
their asset turnover.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,950
So I forecast that when you get out of school,

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,960
you're going to be paid this kind of bonus as well.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,360
So it's important to understand how these ratios work

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,100
and what you can do to affect the ratios.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,260
And then those of you that are going

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,530
to go off and become professional investors, you're

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,420
going to use this type of analysis

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,200
all the time to help you compare companies

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,020
and to help you pick stocks.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,137
Those of you that go off and become investment bankers,

20
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:05,720
these are techniques that you're going

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,850
to use to value companies.

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,950
And we also, finally, introduced the Dupont model, which

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,660
is really a powerful way to think of return on equity,

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:24,200
decompose it into profit margin, asset turnover, and leverage

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,420
to give you a sense of what drives profitability.
