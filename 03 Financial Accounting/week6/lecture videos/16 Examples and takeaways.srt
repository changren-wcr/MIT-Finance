0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
PROFESSOR: Now this is not on the exam,

1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,420
but this is an interesting piece of accounting.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,690
Now instead of looking at deferred compensation

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,770
deferred tax assets, we're going to look at a stock compensation

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,110
deferred tax asset.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,940
So again, this is a simplified example.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,420
But let's just imagine we've given an employee

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,900
stock or options, whose expected value is $1 million.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,090
But they have to wait for three years

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,410
to get the value of the stock or options.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,410
And then let's imagine that during the waiting period,

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,220
the value of that stock went from $1,000 to $10,000,

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,410
or $1 million to $10 million.

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,040
So that the accounting for this is, again, at the time

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,520
that we make the grant, there's no tax deduction.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,420
Nothing has happened from the tax authority's perspective.

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,459
The grant value was $1 million.

17
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,980
So we got an accounting expense of $1 million.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,080
Our book versus tax difference is $1 million,

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,190
so our deferred tax asset associated with this

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,800
is $300,000.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,880
So this is just like the deferred compensation example

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,250
that we just did.

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,160
Now later on, three years from now,

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,180
it turns out that the stock is worth $10 million.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,560
When the employee gets the stock, he or she is taxable,

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,820
and the firm gets a $10 million tax deduction.

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,910
We have no further accounting expense.

28
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,720
Now, the tax versus book difference is $10 million.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,760
The deferred tax asset vanishes.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,240
So before 2017, the accounting for this

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,120
was the company gets a $10 million tax deduction.

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,800
So that's going to be worth $3 million in cash to the company.

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,260
So it gets $3 million extra cash.

34
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,020
The deferred tax asset goes away.

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,980
And then to balance the balance sheet equation,

36
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,390
we're going to put the difference

37
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,890
into contributed capital.

38
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,250
So $2.7 million.

39
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,260
Notice that here, because it's being

40
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,510
put into contributed capital, this has no income effect.

41
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,700
Now for whatever reason, the accounting authorities

42
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,650
decided to change this.

43
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,280
And they changed it, instead of putting the difference

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,930
at $2.7 million into contributed capital, now

45
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,430
you're putting it into retained earnings.

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,770
So this is a tax benefit, or reduction in tax expense.

47
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,840
So this is going to show up in income.

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,180
So this is just an accounting change.

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,260
So nothing happened in terms of the economics.

50
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,590
It used to go into contributed capital with no income effect,

51
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,710
now it's going to go into retained earnings.

52
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,790
It's going to increase income by $2.7 million.

53
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,200
So activists in the press, they look at these effective tax

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,720
rates.

55
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,400
So Amazon has a very low effective tax rate,

56
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,150
and then Joe Biden is doing the typical politician thing

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,300
and saying, Amazon, their effective tax

58
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,070
rate, they're paying less taxes than fire people or plumbers,

59
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,660
or something like that, which is a nonsensical statement.

60
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,950
And then Amazon comes back and says,

61
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,030
we paid every bit of taxes that we've owed.

62
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,990
We've also created a tremendous number of jobs.

63
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:53,010
But what Biden was talking about is Amazon's tax footnote.

64
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,850
This is a reconciliation of the US statutory rate

65
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,980
to the effective tax rate.

66
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:08,370
And then notice in 2016, Amazon's effective tax rate

67
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:17,269
was 36%, when the statutory tax rate was 35%.

68
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,600
Same thing is true in 2017.

69
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,830
Detached statutory tax rate is 35%,

70
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,120
Amazon's effective tax rate drops to 20%.

71
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,790
But almost all of this drop was because

72
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,950
of the screwy accounting I talked to you

73
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,290
about with stock compensation.

74
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,430
So before, in 2016, stock compensation

75
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,000
increased the effective tax rate by 5%.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,230
But because now these excess deductions

77
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,390
are being flowed through into retained earnings

78
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,940
and into income, in 2017 the effective tax rate

79
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,850
goes down by 25% almost, because of stock compensation.

80
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,480
So this is nothing to do with the economics of the taxes

81
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,300
that Amazon is paying, but something

82
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,950
to do with how they're being accounted for.

83
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,880
Not to say, though, that big companies do not

84
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,970
try to pay as little taxes as possible, just

85
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,860
like individuals do.

86
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,090
The difference with big companies like Apple

87
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,720
is they have a tremendous amount of resources,

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,500
and a tremendous amount of incentives to pay low taxes.

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,240
So Apple's tax department is a great tax department,

90
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,840
and they figure out how we can pay the least amount of taxes

91
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,440
possible.

92
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,660
So this Wall Street Journal article

93
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,910
says that Apple, and other tech companies like Apple,

94
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,440
are world class innovators in tax avoidance.

95
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,050
And then a later New York Times article talks about one way

96
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,880
that Apple does this.

97
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,830
So their headquarters are in California.

98
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,870
California has about a 9% corporate tax rate.

99
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,430
Nevada is just right next to California,

100
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,500
especially where Apple is.

101
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,320
So Apple puts in a collection office space in Nevada.

102
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,880
It recognizes all its state income in Nevada,

103
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,740
rather than California.

104
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,710
And they drop that tax rate from 9% in California

105
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,090
to 0 in Nevada.

106
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,210
So taxes are interesting and important.

107
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,010
We talked about how financial statements reflect taxes paid

108
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,750
and taxes owed.

109
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,800
We spent a lot of time looking at income tax disclosures.

110
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,460
And the reason this is important,

111
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,060
again, for you all as investors, is because taxes have big cash

112
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,910
effects, and you want to have some ability

113
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,730
to forecast cash taxes.

114
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,320
And then the final thing we talked

115
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,910
about was the effect of advance on income taxes.

116
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,910
We talked about the tax law changes.

117
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,910
Remember, the tax law just changed in 2018.

118
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:23,690
You might think that's old news, but if the government changes

119
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:31,820
in the US this fall, in 2020, if we get a Democratic president,

120
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,860
many of these tax law changes are going to be reversed.

121
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,760
So instead of the tax rate going down for corporations,

122
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,960
we might expect the tax rate would go up for corporations.

123
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,810
So now you have a framework to think

124
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,020
about what will happen to financial statements

125
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,460
if that's true.

126
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,340
And then we also talked about net operating loss

127
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,730
carryforwards, and the associated valuation

128
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,050
allowances.

129
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,870
And how these valuation allowances

130
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,500
tell you something about future income for companies.

131
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,000
