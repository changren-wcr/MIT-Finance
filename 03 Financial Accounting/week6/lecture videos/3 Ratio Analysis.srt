1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,650
Now, our agenda for today on ratio analysis

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,700
is we're going to introduce and consider some basic ratios.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,640
We're going to talk about why they're calculated,

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,060
who would be interested in them bankers, stockholders

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,260
suppliers, et cetera.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,980
And we're going to also sort of review the ratios

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,440
and review the accounting by talking

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,010
about how the ratios would be affected if management,

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,580
say, paid a dividend, or if management, say, paid off

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,780
their accounts payable.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,080
We're going to look at three types of ratios.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,340
Broadly speaking, there's liquidity and solvency ratios.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,970
Can you pay your bills?

14
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,280
So if you're going to sell to a company,

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,470
you want to make sure that that company can pay you back.

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,280
So you might look at their current ratio,

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,200
which is an example of liquidity solvency ratio.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,500
We're going to look at profitability ratios, which is

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,400
our ability to generate profit.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,130
So we've already seen one of those,

21
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,210
which is return on equity.

22
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,140
So how much profits per unit of equity does a manager generate?

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,330
And the third set of ratios are going

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,870
to look at our efficiency ratios.

25
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,640
Can the manager efficiently manage the firm's operations.

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,760
Now one note on this, I'm going to throw a lot of material

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,420
at you today, but in any kind of test,

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,340
it will always give you a definition

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,480
of the applicable ratio.

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,840
So this is not a course about memorizing

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,006
what exactly the ratio is.

32
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:36,570
And the point of the ratio will be to use--

33
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,380
to test your understanding of the material,

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,230
as in the LIFO-FIFO example we're

35
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,380
going to do in a few minutes.

36
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,630
So now for some liquidity solvency ratios.

37
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,320
And here we're looking back at Amazon's balance sheet.

38
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,320
And the first one is just for review from last time.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,730
Remember, we define working capital as current assets

40
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,110
minus current liabilities.

41
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,870
So please confirm that you see these numbers on the balance

42
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,370
sheet.

43
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,930
But Amazon has current assets of $45 billion.

44
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,870
It's got current liabilities of $44 billion.

45
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,090
And its working capital is about $2 billion.

46
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,730
So working capital is the difference, again,

47
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,510
between current assets and current liabilities.

48
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,530
Now that's dollar amount and it's

49
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,250
hard to compare across companies.

50
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,630
So what people will often do is turn this working capital

51
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,630
into a ratio, which is the current ratio.

52
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,410
So we're going to divide current assets by current liabilities.

53
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,370
So we're taking the same two things, current assets

54
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,330
and current liabilities.

55
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,640
Now we're dividing them.

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,030
So Amazon's current ratio is 1.04.

57
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,220
Now, let's apply these ratios.

58
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,910
So if Amazon were to pay off all of its accounts

59
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,760
payable with cash, how would that

60
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,440
affect its working capital?

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,380
So think about the balance sheet equation.

62
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,400
We're going to pay off accounts payable, which is a liability.

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,190
We're going to reduce accounts payable.

64
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,140
We're going to reduce cash.

65
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,950
So as terms of working capital, there's no change.

66
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,450
So we're going to subtract something

67
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,930
off the current assets, subtract the same amount

68
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,580
off our current liabilities.

69
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,910
Now let's think about the ratio.

70
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,180
What would happen if we reduce current assets

71
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,140
by the amount of cash and we reduce current liabilities

72
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,466
by the same amount of cash?

73
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:47,770
So you have to think about this for a second,

74
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,540
but that's going to increase the ratio.

75
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,920
And as a helpful guideline to you, here some ratio facts.

76
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,710
Here's the same example done for accounts payable.

77
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,460
So if we pay off accounts payable

78
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,620
when our current ratio is 1.04, our current ratio value

79
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,490
in the left hand column is greater than 1.

80
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,339
We're subtracting something from both the numerator

81
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,660
and the denominator.

82
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,640
That's the middle column.

83
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,420
And then the right hand column tells us intuitively

84
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,500
that ratio is going to get bigger.

85
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,000
So obviously, you could plug the amount into your calculator

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,370
and come up with the same number.

87
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,630
But this is a reference for you.
