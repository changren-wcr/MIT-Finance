1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,537
PROFESSOR: So now we're going to--

2
00:00:01,537 --> 00:00:05,130
we talked about deferred tax liabilities,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,230
which live on the liability side of the balance sheet.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,340
Now we're going to talk about deferred tax assets, which

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,990
live on the asset side of the balance sheet.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,700
So they're just the same as deferred tax liabilities,

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,710
except the deferred tax assets either begin or rise,

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,150
whatever word you want to use there, or increase when there's

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,870
a temporary timing difference that causes GAAP pretax income

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,290
to be lower than taxable income on the tax code.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,410
And here we're going to use our example of deferred revenue.

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,720
So, remember, when we get income,

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,230
we don't recognize revenue until we've actually

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,800
provided the service or deliver the goods.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,280
So if we get deferred revenue, that's cash that comes in,

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,670
but it's not income for us under GAAP

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,310
because we have to wait till it's earned.

18
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,460
But when the tax authorities sees cash coming in,

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,240
they're going to tax it, so that revenue

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,320
is revenue for the tax authority as soon as we get it.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,030
So with deferred revenue, we're going

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,330
to pay more cash taxes early, and we're going

23
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,390
to pay less cash taxes later.

24
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,210
So this is going to be the opposite of a deferred tax

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,320
liability.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,850
So as an illustration of deferred tax asset,

27
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,950
we're going to look at a company that rents property out.

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,000
So imagine you're a landlord, and you

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,380
rent units in your building.

30
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,280
So in 2010, let's pretend that we collected

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,020
$100,000 worth of rent, but $50,000 of this rent

32
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,850
was paid in advance for next year, which is 2011.

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,790
So, again, we're going to compare financial reporting

34
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,510
with tax reporting.

35
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,530
Again, our tax rate is going to be 35%.

36
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,740
So for financial reporting, even though we got $100,000,

37
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,990
we only provided the service, which

38
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,960
was running the apartment for 2010 for $50,000 worth of that.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,120
So we're going to recognize $50,000 worth of the rent.

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,060
The other rent is deferred income, which

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,310
we'll recognize next year.

42
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,920
So $50,000 times the 35% tax rate

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,880
gives us a $17,500 tax expense.

44
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,940
So for financial reporting purposes,

45
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:49,550
we got $50,000 income and $17,500 of tax expense.

46
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,070
Now, for tax reporting--

47
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,930
remember, the tax man-- as soon as the tax authority sees cash

48
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,380
coming in-- they're basically a cash system--

49
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,410
So they see that $100,000 come in,

50
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,870
they're going to want to tax all of that.

51
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,080
They're going to tax it at 35%.

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,670
So $100,000 coming in, you're going

53
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,520
to pay $35,000 in taxes on this.

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,940
And in terms of the way this works in the balance sheet

55
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,520
equation, cash taxes are going to be $35,000.

56
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,290
Our tax expense is $17,500.

57
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,230
And to balance the balance sheet equation,

58
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,160
we're going to create a deferred tax asset,

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,830
and you can think of this as sort of a prepaid expense.

60
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,010
So we paid an extra $17,500 of tax this year,

61
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,630
and we expect, therefore, not to pay so much tax next year.

62
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:55,650
So next year, in 2011, we also assume the same facts.

63
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,520
So for financial reporting purposes,

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,030
we actually earn the other $50,000.

65
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,300
Our tax expense on those earnings

66
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,420
are 35% times $50,000, which is $17,500.

67
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,540
For tax reporting purposes, we've already

68
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:21,110
paid tax on the whole $100,000, so we have no new cash taxes

69
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,550
this year.

70
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,210
And then what happens in terms of the balance sheet equation,

71
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,000
we got no cash taxes.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,490
We've got rent expense.

73
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,630
We've got-- I'm sorry.

74
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,250
Tax expense is $17,500.

75
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,310
And then the difference to balance the balance sheet

76
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,510
equation is going to be the reversal of the deferred tax

77
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,590
asset.

78
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,230
And kind of what this is saying to us

79
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:55,550
is that we paid $17,500 in some sense in advance in 2010,

80
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,680
and this is the accounting that shows us

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,500
that we don't owe any further cash taxes in 2011.

82
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,000
