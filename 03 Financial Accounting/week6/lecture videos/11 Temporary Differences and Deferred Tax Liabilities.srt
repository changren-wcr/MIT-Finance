0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,375
PROFESSOR: So now we want to talk

1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:04,890
about temporary differences between accounting income,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,620
or US GAAP, and the tax code.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,680
So temporary differences are items

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,600
that are recognized both by GAAP and by the tax code,

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,810
but they're recognized in different periods.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,240
We're going to do two examples of this--

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,350
first of which we're familiar with,

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,720
which is depreciation expense.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,310
So GAAP uses straight-line depreciation,

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,980
whereas the tax code uses accelerated depreciation.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,670
So tax depreciation tends to be more in the early years,

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,840
and later in the--

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
and less in the later years.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,840
And then we'll do an example of deferred revenue, where,

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
remember, with GAAP, we only earn income

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,540
when we've both earned it and it's collectible--

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,850
so when we've done the work for it.

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,690
With the tax code, on the other hand,

19
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,320
because it's a cash system, as soon

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,780
as it sees the cash come in, it's going to want to tax that.

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,280
So first we want to talk about deferred tax liabilities.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,840
Deferred tax liabilities arise, or begin,

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,590
or they increase when there's a timing difference that

24
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,940
leads to pre-tax income under GAAP

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,570
being temporarily greater than taxable income

26
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,670
under the tax code.

27
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,950
So the example we're going to look at

28
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,270
is depreciation expense.

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,280
So because we use straight-line depreciation under GAAP,

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,550
depreciation expense is going to be lower in the early years

31
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,610
under GAAP than it is for tax, which

32
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,870
uses accelerated depreciation.

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,100
So what's going to happen is because you get the greater tax

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,500
deductions early on, you pay less taxes early on,

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,560
and then you're going to pay more taxes later on.

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,540
So we're going to look at an example of this, which

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,440
this Cooke Company bought a $100,000 asset

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,570
at the beginning of 2010.

39
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,190
For financial reporting, the asset life was two years.

40
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,740
The disproportion rate was straight-line

41
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,680
for financial reporting, and the salvage value was 0.

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,780
For tax reporting, we're going to assume

43
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,160
accelerated depreciation, so the asset life is one year.

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,550
Depreciation rate is we get to write off

45
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,610
all of the asset in the first year,

46
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,190
and then that will leave no depreciation

47
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,060
deduction for the second year, and again, the salvage value

48
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,040
is 0.

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,110
So what's Cooke's depreciation expense for financial reporting

50
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,410
purposes?

51
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,360
So this is review.

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,670
So the depreciable base is $100,000.

53
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,370
We're depreciating over two years with no salvage value.

54
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,990
So $100,000 divided by 2 years is

55
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,650
going to be $50,000 in depreciation expense

56
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:14,680
in 2010, and then $50,000 more in 2011.

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,800
For tax purposes, we're doing an accelerated depreciation,

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,370
so we're writing off the whole asset in the first year.

59
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,920
So we've got $100,000 worth of depreciation in 2010,

60
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,170
which is our first year, and then we'll

61
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,480
have no depreciation in 2011, which is our second year.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,060
So we want to just go through.

63
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,340
In this example, we're going to assume

64
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,450
that Cooke has income, before depreciation and taxes,

65
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,410
of $100,000.

66
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,580
And this is true for both financial reporting

67
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:55,240
and for tax reporting, and this is true in both 2010 and 2011.

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,610
Again, we're going to assume that the tax rate is 35%.

69
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:06,000
So for financial reporting, what's our income before taxes?

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,130
Well, it's $100,000 income minus the $50,000 in depreciation,

71
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,269
so we got $50,000 in income before taxes.

72
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,754
So what's our tax expense, then?

73
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:24,900
Well, our tax expense is $50,000 times 35%,

74
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:31,050
or 17 and 1/2 thousand dollars-- so $50,000 income before taxes

75
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,910
times the 35% tax rate.

76
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,180
Now let's do tax reporting.

77
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,870
So how much is income before taxes for tax reporting?

78
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,150
We got $100,000 in income, but we got $100,000

79
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,820
in depreciation expense, so we have

80
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,760
no income for tax purposes.

81
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,970
That means we have no income to tax.

82
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,750
35% of 0 is 0 cash taxes.

83
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,240
Now let's see how this plays out in the balance sheet equation.

84
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,080
So cash we're going to recognize first.

85
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,520
Notice that we pay no cash taxes.

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,110
So no cash taxes here.

87
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,860
Again, we're assuming that cash taxes are all

88
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,890
paid during the fiscal year, essentially--

89
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,630
although, in practice, there will be

90
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,430
a little bit of taxes payable.

91
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,790
So we're going to run this all through cash.

92
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,650
What's our tax expense?

93
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,250
Again, for financial reporting, our tax expense

94
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,780
is 17 and 1/2 thousand dollars, and then to balance the balance

95
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,860
sheet equation here, we're going to create a deferred tax

96
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,000
liability of 17 and 1/2 thousand dollars.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,930
So this deferred tax liability estimates

98
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,050
taxes expected to be paid in the future,

99
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,400
and it's kind of like a long-term payable.

100
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,050
So we're recognizing the fact that in the future,

101
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,370
because we didn't pay any taxes this year,

102
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,400
in some future year-- which is going to be next year in this

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,520
example--

104
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,170
we're going to have to pay 17 and 1/2 thousand extra taxes.

105
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,430
So let's see what happens, now, in the second year, which

106
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,920
is 2011.

107
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,190
So again, we're assuming the company has income,

108
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,580
before depreciation and taxes, of $100,000,

109
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,330
and that's true for both financial reporting

110
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,560
and for tax reporting.

111
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,470
So for financial reporting, we're

112
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,180
going to look exactly the same in.

113
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:40,150
2011 so we're going to have $100,000 worth of income,

114
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,030
$50,000 worth of depreciation expense,

115
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,920
gives us $50,000 net income before taxes.

116
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:55,240
Our tax expense is 35% of this $50,000 worth of net income.

117
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,000
Now, where things are going to change is for tax reporting.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,540
So how much income are we going to have for tax reporting?

119
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,020
Remember, we used all of our depreciation tax deduction

120
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,530
up last year, so we have no deduction this year,

121
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,180
so we're going to have a full $100,000 of income

122
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,360
before taxes for tax reporting.

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:24,440
We're going to pay 35% of that, or $35,000, in cash taxes.

124
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,980
And then when we look at our balance sheet equation entry,

125
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,390
first of all, we want to keep track of cash.

126
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,640
So cash is going to go down $35,000.

127
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,540
We're going to pay the government $35,000 in taxes.

128
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,540
Tax expense is going to be the same--

129
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,450
this 17 and 1/2 thousand dollars.

130
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,780
And then to have the balance sheet equation balance,

131
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,470
our deferred tax liability is going to go away,

132
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,210
and is basically telling us we paid an extra 17 and 1/2

133
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,380
thousand dollars in taxes in 2011.

134
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,570
And in some sense, these were taxes

135
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,970
that we "owed," in quotation mark, from 2010.

136
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,270
So that's our example, in two periods,

137
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,250
of a deferred tax liability.

138
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,120
Now, obviously, assets' lives are not always two years.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,890
Two years makes for a neat example.

140
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:27,580
Here's an example where we buy $200,000 worth of equipment.

141
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,950
We got a full tax deduction on it--

142
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,890
so that's similar to the current tax law in the US.

143
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,679
So we got a full tax deduction on it,

144
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,980
but we're in a straight-line depreciation for financial

145
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,840
reporting purposes--

146
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,560
$50,000 a year over the next four years.

147
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,600
So the first column shows our $200,000 tax deduction

148
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,680
in the first year.

149
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,850
Second column shows straight-line depreciation

150
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,220
over four years.

151
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,740
And if we subtract the second column from the first column,

152
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,960
we'll get a tax versus book difference

153
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,540
of $150,000 in the first year, and that's a cumulative tax

154
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,820
book difference at that point.

155
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,790
And then moving down into the second panel,

156
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:21,660
if we multiply that cumulative tax book difference times

157
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,080
our tax rate-- and we're assuming a tax rate of 25%,

158
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,980
here--

159
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,710
that tells us what our deferred tax liability

160
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,290
is at the end of the first year, and that

161
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,380
tells us what our deferred tax expense is

162
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,080
at the end of the first year.

163
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,260
And then continuing on in the second panel,

164
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,250
over time, that cumulative tax book difference goes away,

165
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,840
so the deferred tax liability gets smaller and smaller,

166
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,470
so our deferred tax expense reverses

167
00:09:52,470 --> 00:10:01,830
from $37,500 in the first year to a negative $12,500,

168
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:08,020
or a tax benefit of $12,500, in the second, third,

169
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,940
and fourth years.

170
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,990
So now let's look at some tax disclosures.

171
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,780
We're going to look at Goldman Sachs company, which

172
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,750
is the big investment bank and bank,

173
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,360
and we're going to look at their tax footnote from 2016.

174
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,540
So remember, companies use different vocabulary here.

175
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,480
So we see, here, the words "current tax expense."

176
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,310
What that actually means is that Goldman owed about $2.4 billion

177
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:46,540
in tax to the tax authorities for 2016.

178
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,790
Second item at the bottom of the table,

179
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,920
here, is the provision for taxes.

180
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,180
That's Goldman's income tax expense.

181
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,610
And so when we look at that in the balance sheet

182
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:03,070
equation for 2016, Goldman paid cash taxes, again,

183
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,340
of about $2.4 billion.

184
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,581
They had a provision for taxes of about $2.9 billion.

185
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:15,670
And again, to make the balance sheet equation balance here,

186
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,800
we're going to put $551,000,000 in deferred tax expense,

187
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,890
and you see that deferred tax expense

188
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,500
at the second-to-the-bottom line at the table, there.

189
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,000
