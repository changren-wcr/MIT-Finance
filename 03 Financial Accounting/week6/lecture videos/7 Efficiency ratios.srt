00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,875
PROFESSOR: All right.

1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:04,560
So now we've talked about solvency ratios.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,800
We've talked about profitability ratios.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,550
The third class ratios we want to talk about

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,860
are efficiency ratios.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,820
And in the middle, accounts receivable turnover revenue

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,580
divided by net accounts receivable,

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,470
remember we've seen that when we talked

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,910
about accounts receivable a couple of classes ago.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,460
Inventory turnover, cost of goods

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,400
sold divided by inventory, we also

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,510
talked about that a couple of classes ago.

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,180
So what you basically want here is big numbers.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,530
So how fast are you generating revenue per unit accounts

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,610
receivable?

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,520
How fast are you generating cost of goods

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,280
sold per unit of inventory?

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,520
Now, the king of these ratios is asset turnover,

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,520
which is revenue divided by total assets.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,710
So if I give you a certain amount of total assets,

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,810
how much revenue can you generate

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,920
based on those total assets?

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,090
So this is a very common managerial performance

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,740
evaluation where, for example, in an investment firm,

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,760
I'll give you a million dollars.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,010
And your evaluation is basically how much profit

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,860
or how much total revenue can you generate

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,250
from those total assets.

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,310
So how fast can you generate revenue per unit of assets

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,030
that I've given you?

30
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,620
So this is a very important ratio.

31
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,250
Now, just a little bit a review of inventory--

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,800
and this is inventory turnover in particular.

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,380
So let's suppose that Amazon's definition of inventory

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,490
turnover is cost of goods sold divided by ending inventory.

35
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,840
So they've got turnover of 7.7 times.

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,110
We already talked that Amazon uses first in, first out.

37
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,900
Now, if contrary to fact, they were to switch over to LIFO,

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,909
what would you think the impact on inventory turnover would be?

39
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:14,850
Would it be higher or lower under LIFO?

40
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,420
So let's just break it down, look at the numerator

41
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,220
first, which is cost of goods sold.

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,990
So if we use LIFO instead of FIFO,

43
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,690
under normal circumstances, what's

44
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,070
that going to do to our cost of goods sold?

45
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,900
So that's going to increase it.

46
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,140
So I remember from our discussions inventory,

47
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,120
new costs are going to flow to cost of goods sold under LIFO.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,770
And those new costs are going to tend

49
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,150
to be higher if inflation is going up.

50
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,860
What would happen under LIFO to ending inventory?

51
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,780
So that's going to go down.

52
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,670
So the new costs are going to be sold under LIFO.

53
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,530
The old costs are going to end up in ending inventory.

54
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,740
They're going to tend to be lower.

55
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,430
So what's going to be the effect on our inventory turnover?

56
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,440
Well, the numerator is going up.

57
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,870
The denominator is going down.

58
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,000
So inventory turnover is going to increase.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,410
Remember, we saw this last time in the example of ExxonMobil.

60
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,070
So the big difference is between inventory turnover

61
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,390
between a LIFO firm and a FIFO firm.

62
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,070
But to get this, we had to assume normal circumstances.

63
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:42,740
And just as a review, what are normal circumstances?

64
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,360
So one we just talked about, we need rising prices for this

65
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,000
to happen.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,240
So as long as prices are going up,

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,370
we have normal circumstances.

68
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,690
The second one as review is a little bit more subtle.

69
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,670
Can you think of that?

70
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,880
Remember, we can't be selling off inventory

71
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,610
and bringing in old costs as a result of inventory sales.

72
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,830
So that's a review of the ratio and a little bit

73
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,455
of a review of LIFO and FIFO.

74
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:16,019


75
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:23,370
Here's the three efficiency ratios for Amazon and Walmart.

76
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,720
So Amazon turns their assets over slower than does

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,000
Walmart, 1.63 versus 2.42.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,890
Their accounts receivable turnover is also slower than as

79
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,300
is Walmart.

80
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,450
And remember, when we talked about accounts receivable

81
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:48,930
turnover, a good way to think about the ratio is to flip it

82
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,870
and divide it into 365 days.

83
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,190
So that tells you that Amazon has

84
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,990
22 days of accounts receivable whereas Walmart only

85
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,930
has 4.3 days of accounts receivable.

86
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,450
And when I looked at these numbers,

87
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,510
they're sort of puzzling because you would think that Amazon

88
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,520
would be super efficient.

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,500
You would think that Amazon would

90
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,440
be collecting its accounts receivable a lot faster.

91
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,130
And then if you read the footnote on Amazon's accounts

92
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,740
receivable, there's a clue in there,

93
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,740
which is Amazon is lending money to some of its sellers

94
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,440
so that they can buy goods to sell.

95
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,680
So that money that Amazon is lending

96
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,020
is effectively in accounts receivable.

97
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,630
It shows up in their accounts receivable.

98
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,640
But those accounts receivable tend

99
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,080
to be collected much slower than your ordinary customer accounts

100
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,750
receivable.

101
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,790
So I think that's what's going on here.

102
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,370
So again, what's nice about ratio analysis,

103
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,130
it gives you some places to look,

104
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,050
and then you look into the annual report

105
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,370
and try to understand what the differences are.
