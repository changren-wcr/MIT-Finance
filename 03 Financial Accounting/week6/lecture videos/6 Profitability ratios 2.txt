00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
PROFESSOR: So, now, let's just look at some examples

1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,540
of these ratios.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,990
So Walmart's return on assets, net income divided by ending

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,100
total assets, is 7.4%.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,430
Amazon's return on assets, net income

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,800
divided by ending total assets, is 2.8%.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,510
Walmart's ROE, net income divided

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,189
by ending stockholders' equity, Walmart's return on equity

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:40,410
is 18.2%, whereas Amazon's return on equity is only 12.3%.

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,650
And, in a few minutes, as we wrap up these examples,

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:49,140
we're going to examine exactly why Amazon's return on equity

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,620
is lower than Walmart's return on equity.

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,250
But, first, let's run through some checks

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,360
of our understanding of these ratios.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,750
So Amazon's return on equity, net income of 2,371

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,520
divided by total stockholders' equity of 19,285,

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,750
so their return on equity is 12.3%.

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:20,010
What would happen to their ROE if, at the very end

18
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,140
of the year, Amazon issued stock for cash?

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,070
Would that have an effect on net income?

20
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,530
No, it's at the very end of the year.

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,960
What would it do to stockholders' equity?

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,670
Stockholders' equity would go up.

23
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,750
So return on equity would go down.

24
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,910
Notice that I formulated this question

25
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,430
at the very end of the year because,

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,750
if Amazon issued stock for cash during the year,

27
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,090
presumably, it would have income on that cash, which would

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,840
cause net income to go up.

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,080
So, just to keep things simple, we

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,160
assume the transaction happens at the very end of the year.

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,780
Now, let's look at another example.

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,487
So, at the very end of the year-- again,

33
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:10,820
for the same reason, we're going to look at the very end

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,430
of the year--

35
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,125
Amazon pays a cash dividend.

36
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,760


37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,340
Does that have an effect on their net income?

38
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,840
No.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,310
Remember, income is not affected by dividends.

40
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,680
Does that affect their stockholders' equity?

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,110
Yes, it's going to cause their stockholders' equity

42
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,100
to go down.

43
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,260
So, as a result of that, because stockholders' equity goes down,

44
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,330
the ratio ROE is going to go up.

45
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,934


46
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:45,890
Now, what would happen at the very end of the year

47
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,930
if all of our customers-- and this

48
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,750
is sort of an extreme example, but let's just pretend

49
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,355
all of our customers paid off all of their receivables.

50
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:59,340
Would that have an effect on net income?

51
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,830
No, it's at the very end of the year.

52
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,700
Would it have an effect on stockholders' equity?

53
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,200
No.

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,090
So there's no income here.

55
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,424
So, this example, ROE is unaffected.

56
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:19,120
Now, let's suppose it's the dreaded accounting error.

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,070
Let's suppose that, at the end of the year,

58
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,190
Amazon finds out it has an error.

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,210
It forgot to make the entries for an additional $100,000

60
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,510
in accrued compensation.

61
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,760
Now, when it corrects that error,

62
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,410
what's going to happen to net income?

63
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,440
So net income is going to go down because

64
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,510
of the additional expense.

65
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,780
What's going to happen to stockholders' equity?

66
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,240
Stockholders' equity is going to go down because we

67
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,000
have less net income.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,450
And so our ratio is going to go down

69
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,600
because we're subtracting a negative number

70
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,060
from the numerator and a negative number

71
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,050
from the denominator of a ratio that's less than 1.

72
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,070
So you can sort of check that by calculator

73
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,256
or by using the ratio facts that I showed you earlier.

74
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:11,670
A similar example is, what would happen

75
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,980
if Amazon, at the end of the year,

76
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,890
increased its expense on estimated returns?

77
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,519
So, again, similar to the previous example,

78
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,370
income would go down.

79
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,520
Because income is going down, stockholders' equity

80
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,900
would go down.

81
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,170
And, again, our return on equity would go down as well.
