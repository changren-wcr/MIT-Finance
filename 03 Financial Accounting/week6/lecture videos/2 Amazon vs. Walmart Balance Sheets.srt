00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
PROFESSOR: So here's comparative balance sheets

1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,042
for Walmart and Amazon in 2016.

2
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:07,500
If you look at the bottom here, you

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,410
can see that Walmart has total assets of about $200 billion.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,530
Amazon has about half that at $83 billion.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,010
So these differences in sizes make them difficult to compare.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,260
So what we'll do is to compute a common size balance sheet.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,240
And we'll just divide all the balance

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,960
sheet numbers of Walmart by their total assets

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,330
of $199 billion.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,350
And we're going to divide all the asset amounts of Amazon

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,430
by their total assets of $83 billion.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,970
And then, once we've common sized these, you can see,

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,280
from the columns that have percentages on them,

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,840
Amazon has a lot more cash than does Walmart.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,270
We talked a little bit about that last time

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,040
that Amazon is saving cash, maybe for an acquisition.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,280
Amazon has more receivables.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,270
Walmart, on the other hand, has much more inventory

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,710
as a percentage of its balance sheet than does Amazon.

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,470
And one intuition for this is that Walmart

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,340
has all these physical stores spread around the country.

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,760
All those stores have inventory, whereas Amazon

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,180
has a few shipping centers spread around the country.

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,300
So Amazon can carry less inventory.

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,100
The same intuition applies to property, plant, and equipment.

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,410
Walmart has all these physical stores.

27
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,060
It has more property, plant, and equipment.

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,480
So, again, the common size balance sheet sort of

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,670
helps us to compare these two companies apples to apples.

30
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,250
Now, here's a common size balance sheet

31
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,910
where we're looking at the liabilities and stockholders'

32
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,200
equity of Walmart and Amazon.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,770
As you sort of scroll through this,

34
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,230
you can see that accounts payable for Amazon

35
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,030
is much larger.

36
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,820
Maybe Amazon is using their suppliers

37
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,419
as a source of financing, paying off their suppliers

38
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,460
more slowly.

39
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,450
We see that current liabilities for Amazon is much greater.

40
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,920
On the other hand, Walmart has more long-term debt.

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,550
Walmart also has more stockholders' equity.

42
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,480
As an aside, note that, at the bottom of the balance sheet,

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,200
Walmart shows non-controlling interest.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,800
This is a form of equity we will discuss in lecture 8.

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,530
Before we start our ratio analysis

46
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,350
and as a review of inventory accounting,

47
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,350
remember that, if a firm uses LIFO or if a firm uses FIFO,

48
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,860
those firms are going to have big differences in income

49
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,750
and total assets.

50
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,410
And we want to make sure before we start in on this exercise

51
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,880
that Amazon and Walmart are in fact comparable.

52
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,090
So how could we get information on their inventories?

53
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,280
Well, we have their annual report.

54
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,140
We have their 10-K. Let's just open that up and then

55
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,210
search on the word inventories.

56
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,820
So, if we do that, with Amazon, we search.

57
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,320
We search.

58
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,820
We search.

59
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,860
We keep clicking on inventories.

60
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,890
And, at some point, the Amazon 10-K

61
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,970
will tell us that Amazon uses FIFO, or First In, First Out.

62
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,710
We'll do the same exercise for Walmart.

63
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,100
And what Walmart tells us is more complicated,

64
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,770
but, essentially, their inventory valuation

65
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,020
is the same as FIFO.

66
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,590
It uses LIFO for US inventories.

67
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,450
Remember, that makes sense because that's

68
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,400
permitted in the US.

69
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,300
And they use FIFO for international inventories.

70
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,360
And, again, that makes sense because FIFO

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,660
is the only thing that's permitted internationally.

72
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,300
The key point, though, is that, for Walmart, LIFO and FIFO

73
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,170
are about the same thing.

74
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,110
So, in doing these comparisons, we

75
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,520
don't have to worry about inventory differences.
