00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
PROFESSOR: So we just talked about the current ratio, which

1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,820
is a short-term liquidity ratio.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,510
Now, we're going to look at long-term liquidity ratios.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,660
So an example of a long-term liquidity ratio

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,240
is the debt-equity ratio.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,440
To form that ratio, we divide total liabilities divided

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,090
by total stockholders' equity.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,350
And this is going to be associated with bankruptcy risk

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,160
because, as your stockholders' equity gets smaller and smaller

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,510
and your total liabilities get bigger and bigger, the chance

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,050
that-- if you have a big loss or something like that,

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,200
you'll wipe out your stockholders' equity.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,910
You'll only be left with liabilities,

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,880
which means you'll be bankrupt.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,170
This ratio can also be expressed as long-term debt

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,420
plus short-term debt, so just the debt

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,470
component of total liabilities, also divided

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,930
by stockholders' equity.

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,050
Another alternative that we're going to look at in a minute

19
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,970
is the leverage ratio.

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,240
And here we're going to divide total assets divided

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,650
by total stockholders' equity, but just noticing in the red

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,280
there that assets are equal to liabilities plus equity.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,320
The leverage ratio is just 1 plus the debt-to-equity ratio.

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,090
So other examples of solvency and liquidity ratios

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,360
that are widely used, first one is something called

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,480
times interest earned where we take Earnings

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,470
Before Interest and Taxes, or EBIT, and divide it

28
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,210
by interest expense.

29
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,340
The intuition here is, do you have a lot of profitability

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,570
to cover your interest expense?

31
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,140
So, as your profitability get smaller,

32
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,000
your ability to pay interest gets smaller as well.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,040
So you're more likely to go bankrupt.

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,680
And then this is a little bit out of the scope of our class.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,650
So this is not on the exam, but I

36
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,930
want to tell you about Altman's 1968 Z-score, which is

37
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,729
a bankruptcy prediction model.

38
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,800
So the Z-score is a combination of five financial statement

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,410
ratios.

40
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,600
So we've got working capital to total assets, which

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,230
is kind of the current ratio we just talked about.

42
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,010
We've got retained earnings to total assets, which

43
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,150
is kind of a leverage ratio.

44
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,760
So how much retained earnings do we have to total assets?

45
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,090
We've got EBIT, or earnings before interest and taxes,

46
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,210
to total assets, which is how profitable we

47
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,510
are per unit of total assets.

48
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,170
The fourth ratio is market value of total equity

49
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,970
divided by total liabilities.

50
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,780
So that's a market leverage ratio.

51
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,590
And then the final one is sales to total assets.

52
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,780
And that's a turnover ratio that we'll be

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,520
talking about in just a second.

54
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,090
And so what Altman did was run regressions

55
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,340
with these five inputs.

56
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,150
And he found that a weighted combination of these things

57
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,770
was a score.

58
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,730
And this Z-score, when it becomes lower and lower,

59
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,640
tells you that there's a much higher probability

60
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,620
of bankruptcy.

61
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,880
So this is something that you'll see

62
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,000
in your advanced financial statement class,

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,310
but I wanted to mention it here now.

64
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,810
Again, it's not going to be on our exam.

65
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,140
Coming back to the debt-equity ratio,

66
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,600
please confirm that you can find these numbers

67
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,280
in the financial statements that we discussed earlier.

68
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,990
Walmart's debt-equity ratio is 1.48.

69
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,010
Amazon's debt-equity ratio is 3.32.

70
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,280
You can see the red numbers are the balance sheet

71
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,820
information that we're using to compute the ratios.

72
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,350
Walmart's leverage ratio is 2.48,

73
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,630
whereas Amazon's leverage ratio is 4.32.

74
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,630
And, again, notice that the leverage ratio for Amazon,

75
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,510
for example, is exactly 1 greater than Amazon's

76
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,810
debt-equity ratio.

77
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,019
So it's another way of expressing

78
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,030
the same concept, which is how much leverage you have.

79
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,720
So, to wrap this up, let's do a review problem.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,630
Amazon's debt-equity ratio is, again, 3.32.

81
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:41,800
And we're taking $64 billion divided by $19 billion

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,410
to get that 3.32.

83
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,090
And then let's think.

84
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,760
Would this ratio increase, decrease, or remain unchanged

85
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,130
if management took the following actions in 2016?

86
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,910
So if it pays more dividends in 2016--

87
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,770
so, if we pay more dividends, does that

88
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,290
have an effect on liabilities?

89
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,090
No.

90
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,790
What does it do to stockholders' equity?

91
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,380
It's going to lower it.

92
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,380
So, therefore, our debt-equity ratio

93
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,960
would increase because the denominator

94
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,270
is becoming smaller.

95
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,880
What would happen if we recorded more bad debt expense in 2016?

96
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,670
Does that affect our liabilities?

97
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,710
Again, no.

98
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,440
Does that affect our stockholders' equity?

99
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,120
It lowers it.

100
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,200
So, by the same logic as above, our debt-equity ratio

101
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,040
would increase if Amazon recorded more bad debt expense.

102
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,210
Now, what would happen if Amazon paid off all of its accounts

103
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,360
payable with cash in 2016?

104
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,735
So that's going to lower liabilities.

105
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:56,550
So accounts payable will go away.

106
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,910
Will it have an effect on stockholders' equity?

107
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,870
No.

108
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,790
So liabilities go down.

109
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,480
That's going to decrease our debt-equity ratio.

110
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,395
And then, finally, suppose we issue a billion dollars

111
00:06:10,395 --> 00:06:14,100
worth of long-term debt and a billion dollars worth of stock

112
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,350
at the very end of 2016.

113
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,290
So that's going to increase our liabilities.

114
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,620
It's going to increase our stockholders' equity.

115
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,140
Overall, because our ratio is bigger than 1

116
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,170
to start off with, that's going to decrease

117
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,470
our debt-equity ratio from the ratio facts

118
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,870
that we just talked about a minute ago.

119
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,450
Also, obviously, this is an easy one

120
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,540
to plug into your calculator.
