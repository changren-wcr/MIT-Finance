00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,520
TEACHER: So let's see how this plays out

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:10,480
in Goldman Sachs' income tax disclosure footnote in 2016.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,270
So like a lot of companies--

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,400
remember deferred tax assets are going

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,210
to be on the asset side of your balance sheet as an asset.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,040
Deferred tax liabilities are going

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,760
to be on the liability side on your balance sheet

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,740
as a liability.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,890
But a lot of companies in their tax footnotes

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,110
will show you assets first.

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,290
So that's the first 2/3 of this table.

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,260
It shows you that Goldman has--

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,846
excuse me Goldman has deferred tax assets of $5.2 billion.

14
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:46,860
And they're going to subtract off their deferred tax

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,280
liabilities, which is approximately $1.5 billion

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,450
and they show a net deferred tax asset of $3.7 billion.

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,480
So that's an sort of overview of how to interpret the table.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,730
And then each of these assets and liabilities

19
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,950
will tell you what types of transactions

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,400
are giving rise to the deferred tax assets

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,250
or are giving rise to the deferred tax liabilities.

22
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,910
So as I showed you a minute ago we've

23
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,240
got depreciation and amortization here

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,730
and the intuition for this account

25
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,490
is just that what we saw before.

26
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,740
Because we're doing straight line depreciation

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,300
for a book and accelerated depreciation for tax,

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,870
we're going to have a liability for future taxes paid

29
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,440
because we sort of deducted more depreciation

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,730
in the early years.

31
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,780
And that Goldman is showing you that they've got a $1.2 billion

32
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,400
liability for future tax payments related

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,860
to depreciation and amortization.

34
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,510
And then compensation and benefits,

35
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,710
there's a $2.5 billion deferred tax asset associated

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,390
with compensation and benefits.

37
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,639
And I'll show you a slide on this in just a second,

38
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,360
but the intuition is for financial reporting purposes,

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,740
we're going to expense deferred compensation when we grant it

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,290
to an employee, but it's only going

41
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,040
to be tax deductible when the employee ultimately

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,030
receives it.

43
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,150
So here's a little bit of intuition for this,

44
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,110
which is our deferred compensation deferred tax

45
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,220
asset.

46
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,510
This is a very simplified example.

47
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,950
So and it sort of works well with investment banking

48
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,620
nowadays.

49
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,610
So remember with investment banking

50
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,835
it used to be that we would give an employee a million

51
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:53,110
dollar bonus and then he or she would just take that bonus away

52
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,580
in cash.

53
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,360
Now for regulatory purposes lots of places

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,640
have a mandatory deferral on the bonus.

55
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,130
So that mandatory deferral means that even though the employees

56
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,990
earn the bonus in year one, the employee will not actually

57
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,720
get the cash for another three years

58
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,770
assuming that he or she stays with the company

59
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,330
and there's no kind of fraud revealed afterwards.

60
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:28,340
So we see in the table here years one, two, and three, when

61
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,100
the employee earns a bonus in year one

62
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,360
the firm gets no tax deduction, but it does take an accounting

63
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,520
expense of a million dollars.

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,640
We have a tax versus book difference minus $1 million.

65
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,440
And this book difference creates a deferred tax asset

66
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,870
of $300,000.

67
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,810
Nothing really happens in year two.

68
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,840
In year three the employee now can take the bonus in cash.

69
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,050
At that point, the firm gets a tax deduction

70
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,630
of a million dollars.

71
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,040
There's no further accounting expense.

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,110
So the book tax difference reverses at that point.

73
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,030
The deferred tax asset goes away.

74
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,140
So our balance sheet equation in year three.

75
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,130
We are going to get a $1 million tax deduction

76
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,590
at a 30% rate that's going to give us $300,000 in cash coming

77
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,990
from the government and at that point

78
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,460
the deferred tax asset will go away.

79
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,910
So looking again at the deferred tax liability

80
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,400
disclosures of Goldman Sachs.

81
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,850
Here we have depreciation and amortization.

82
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,650
So all I've done is of the earlier table

83
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,230
I showed you we're just blowing this up

84
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,570
and we're looking specifically at depreciation

85
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,110
and amortization.

86
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,540
So we see that we got $1.2 billion deferred tax

87
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,320
liability associated with depreciation and amortization.

88
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,210
What this is telling us is that to date tax depreciation

89
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,210
is higher than GAAP depreciation.

90
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,050
Therefore, total taxable income to date

91
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,900
is lower than total GAAP income.

92
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,590
In the future when this difference reverses

93
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,270
Goldman will pay more tax.

94
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,650
So how much higher is total tax depreciation

95
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,360
than GAAP depreciation?

96
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,580
Again, assuming a 35% rate.

97
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,170
So if we take the total deferred tax liability divide that

98
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:40,600
by the 35% rate that tells us that over the life of the firm,

99
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,100
tax depreciation has been higher than GAAP depreciation

100
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,060
by about $3.4 billion.

101
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,630
Now let's look at the summary of this table, which

102
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,316
is deferred tax assets of $5.2 billion

103
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:01,660
minus deferred tax liabilities of about a billion and a half.

104
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,970
We've got net deferred tax assets as of 2016

105
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,214
of $3.7 billion.

106
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:14,310
So in the future based on this, how much higher

107
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,200
will GAAP total income be than total taxable income be?

108
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,780
Again, assuming a 35% rate.

109
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:29,998
So if we take the net deferred tax assets of $3.7 billion

110
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:35,080
divide that by a 35% rate that's telling us

111
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,254
that in the future total GAAP income will be $10 billion.

112
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:44,140
$10.5 billion higher than total taxable income.

113
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,650


114
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,710
So then the question is, what would happen if the tax

115
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,090
rate went from 35% to 21%?

116
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,860
So that our total deferred tax assets, net deferred tax

117
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,350
assets, would be, again, the income

118
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,530
difference a $10.5 billion.

119
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,860
But now valued at a 21% rate.

120
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,480
So it be a $2.2 billion deferred tax asset.

121
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,580
So I'm just repeating that question here.

122
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,850
So what will our net deferred tax assets

123
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,320
be if a 21% rate were assumed instead.

124
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,980
So they would be $2.2 billion, which

125
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:34,770
would be a reduction of $1.5 billion from the $3.7 billion

126
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,570
that we show in the table right now.

127
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,270
Now just to push this example a little bit further.

128
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:50,080
What would the income effect be on Goldman Sachs as of 12 2016

129
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,230
if the tax rate were reduced from 35% to 21%?

130
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,800
So just looking at this in the balance sheet equation entry.

131
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,500
Remember, our deferred tax asset is now

132
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,180
worth a billion five less and so to balance the balance sheet

133
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,890
equation.

134
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,110
We're getting no cash here.

135
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,480
To balance the balance sheet equation,

136
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,790
we're going to have an additional billion five

137
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,570
of tax expense.

138
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,790
So if you have deferred tax assets and the tax rate

139
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,390
goes down that's bad for you because that's

140
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,500
going to cause your income to be lower in this amount

141
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,310
by $1.5 billion.
