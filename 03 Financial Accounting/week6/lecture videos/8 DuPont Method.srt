1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,710
So remember, we've talked about leverage or solvency ratios.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,280
We've talked about profitability ratios.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,550
And we talked about efficiency ratio.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,660
What's known as DuPont analysis, which was invented back

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,010
in the 20s, I think, by the DuPont corporation

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,130
is a way to sort of tie these all together

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,600
and understand why return on equity is either high or low.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,270
So what this diagram shows, is that return on equity, which

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,080
is net income divide by stockholders' equity,

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,840
can be rewritten as net income divided

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,490
by total assets multiplied by total assets divided

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,410
by stockholders' equity so that your drivers a return on equity

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,170
or a return on assets multiplied by leverage.

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,850
But what that tells you is holding your return on assets

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,680
constant, one way you can increase your return on equity

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,270
is by increasing your leverage.

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,310
And so that's what you see banks do.

18
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,260
So banks have very low return on assets, probably

19
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,060
something like 2%.

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,670
But they have very high financial leverage

21
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,190
their leverage, about 10 to 1 or 20 to 1.

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,100
And that's the way the bank gets a normal 10% to 15%

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,090
return on equity through financial leverage.

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,010
A further way to decompose return on equity

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,280
is by looking at return on assets.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,910
We can do the same type of decomposition

27
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,770
by multiplying and dividing by sales over sales

28
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,810
and then rearranging.

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,140
So we'll get a return on assets equals

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,640
net income divided by sales multiplied by sales divided

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,705
by total assets.

32
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:05,070
So the return on assets is how much profit

33
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,020
you have per unit of sales multiplied by how fast you

34
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,420
turn your assets over.

35
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,610
So another way of saying this is that the three drivers

36
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,060
a return on equity are profit margin,

37
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,990
how big is your profit margin, asset turnover,

38
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,010
how fast are you turning your assets over, and leverage,

39
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,590
so how much financial leverage do you have.

40
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,820
So when we compare Amazon, we see that their return on equity

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,190
is 12.3%.

42
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,890
They've got a low profit margin.

43
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,020
They got a low asset turnover.

44
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,750
But in some sense they juiced that up

45
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,650
by having a lot of financial leverage.

46
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,150
Walmart on the other hand, is a much larger return on equity,

47
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,300
a 5% larger return on equity.

48
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,300
They got a larger profit margin.

49
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,890
They use their assets more efficiently,

50
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,250
so they turn them over more efficiently.

51
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,790
The reason that it's not even bigger

52
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:18,480
is because their leverage is lower than is Amazon.

53
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,320
So those dials sort of tell us why Amazon's return on equity

54
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,750
is lower than Walmart's.

55
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,710
So they're not getting as much margin per unit of sales.

56
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,850
And they're not turning their assets over as fast.

57
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,560
But they do have more financial leverage.

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,260
And just something to think about,

59
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,680
if Amazon were concerned about its return

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,980
on equity, what would be an easy thing

61
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,980
to do if it wanted to increase its return on equity?

62
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,850
So remember Amazon's balance sheet

63
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,010
that we looked at earlier.

64
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,340
Amazon has lots of cash on its balance sheet.

65
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,300
So if Amazon paid off some of that cash,

66
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,310
paid it out to its stockholders as a dividend, then

67
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,440
that would lower equity.

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,200
And that will increase asset turnover.

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,850
And it would also increase leverage.

70
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,250
So it would lower equity and assets,

71
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,550
enabling them to increase their asset turnover

72
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,330
and increase their leverage.

73
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,790
Now that doesn't come completely free.

74
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,070
Remember that Amazon has that cash.

75
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,320
They're going to be earning interest on that cash.

76
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,090
So that would cause their margin to go down a little bit.

77
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,200
But overall, if they paid some of that cash out as a dividend,

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,270
that would cause their leverage and turnover to go up more

79
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,200
and cause their return on equity to go up as well.
