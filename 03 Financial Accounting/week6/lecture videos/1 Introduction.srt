PROFESSOR: In this class, we're going

1
00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:05,850
to talk about financial statement analysis.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,590
Financial statement analysis, which

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,650
is also known as ratio analysis, has many different uses.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,990
One that we all care about is it's

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,850
used to evaluate managers and determine their compensation.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,970
So for example, a manager might be

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,940
paid based on his or her ability to maximize return on equity.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,350
And if you haven't been compensated based on a ratio

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,160
yet, in your next job, you probably will.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,420
A second purpose that we'll see in just a second

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,560
is just to help us compare firms of different sizes.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,750
The third purpose as we'll also see in a few minutes

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,690
is to generate quick measures of firm health or performance.

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,420
So is this firm likely to pay us if we issue debt to them?

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,050
So we'll have a quick measure like a current ratio

16
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,560
to see that.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,530
More complicated, we're going to use it

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,120
for valuation analysis and the kind of valuation analysis

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,910
that's involved in making acquisitions.

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,390
So when you go on to take further finance courses,

21
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,820
you'll do valuation analysis.

22
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,130
And many of these ratios will be inputs

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,620
of that valuation analysis.

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,770
Finally, it can be used as a basis of trading rules.

25
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,050
So recently, we saw the accrual anomaly.

26
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,620
So short stocks that have high accruals.

27
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,170
Buy stocks that have low accruals.

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,150
There are other trading rules that are based on ratios.

29
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,220
So many different purposes for ratio analysis

30
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,620
or financial statement analysis.

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,890
We're going to do a big example in this class.

32
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,790
And we're going to compare Amazon and Walmart.

33
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,580
So both of these are big, successful companies.

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,564
Both of these are broadly engaged in retail sales.

35
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:12,550
But historically, they've taken different strategies.

36
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,180
Amazon began as an online retailer.

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,950
But as we talked about recently, Amazon has bought Whole Foods.

38
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,050
And Amazon is moving into physical stores.

39
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,160
So it's got a bricks and mortar presence.

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,060
Walmart, on the other hand, began in physical stores.

41
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,000
There are Walmarts all around the country.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,640
But now it's trying to move online and compete with Amazon.

43
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,920
In our example, we'll see that Amazon

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,980
has a lower return on equity, which

45
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,680
we'll use the acronym ROE for.

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,580
So Amazon has a lower ROE than Walmart.

47
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,280
And part of what we're going to do in our example today

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,440
is explore why.

49
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,670
And just note we'll always give you definitions of ratios.

50
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,180
So return on equity for our discussion today

51
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,500
is equal to net income divided by ending stockholders' equity.

52
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,000
