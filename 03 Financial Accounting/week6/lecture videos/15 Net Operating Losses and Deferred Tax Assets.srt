1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,400
PROFESSOR: Now we want to shift gears a little bit

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,240
and talk about net operating losses, which

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,800
I'm going to use the acronym NOLs, and deferred tax assets.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,700
We're going to do this in an example.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,500
So if a company incurs a loss for tax purposes,

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,780
it doesn't get to pay negative tax.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,570
So if you're an individual or if you're a company,

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,160
and you have a $100,000 loss, for example,

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,550
the government's not going to pay you a refund of $21,000

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,080
or whatever the tax rate is times your loss, OK?

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,410
Instead, what you have to do is wait,

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,560
carry that loss forward, and then to the extent

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,800
that you have future taxable income in the future,

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,650
you can lower that future taxable income

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:59,450
and then get your so-called deduction at that point.

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:04,959
So as we'll see in a second, net operating loss carryforwards

17
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,370
or loss carryforwards are going to create a deferred tax asset,

18
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,540
OK?

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,750
Because of the fact that if we have a net operating loss

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,360
carryforward, it's telling us that we're

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,910
going to pay less cash taxes in the future.

22
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,880
So let's just see this in a quick example.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,300
So this XYZ company, it has financial reporting income,

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,590
or book income, and it has taxable income

25
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,360
of minus $100,000 in 2015, OK?

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,360
It's going to carry this tax loss forward.

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,820
Its tax rate in this example is 30%.

28
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,590
So our income for financial reporting purposes,

29
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,520
where we have a minus $100,000 worth of income,

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,110
multiply that by a 30% tax rate, and that gives us

31
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,470
a tax benefit of $30,000.

32
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,180
Now for tax reporting purposes, we have $100,000 loss.

33
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,930
But again, the tax authority is not

34
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,140
going to give us a refund for this loss,

35
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,170
so our cash taxes this year are zero.

36
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,070
So then looking at this in the balance sheet equation entry,

37
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,410
cash taxes are zero.

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,260
We've got a tax benefit of $30,000,

39
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,440
so we're going to create a deferred tax asset of $30,000.

40
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,660
Now, there's a couple of things that can happen here.

41
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,900
So one thing that can happen here

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,270
is we're going to be again profitable in the future.

43
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,940
So let's look at the example when

44
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:50,910
we're again profitable in the future in 2016.

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,040
So just for simplicity, let's pretend that in 2016

46
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,900
instead of having a loss of $100,000, as we did in, 2015

47
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,490
and in this year we have profits of $100,000.

48
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,530
So for financial reporting purposes,

49
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,560
we got profits of $100,000, and we'll

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,860
have tax expense of 30% of that, or $30,000.

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:24,180
Now, for tax reporting purposes, we've got $100,000 in income,

52
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,610
but we have that loss from last year, which

53
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,880
is that $100,000 in red there.

54
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,140
So income of $100,000 minus a tax loss

55
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,940
carried forward of $100,000, that gives us tax reporting

56
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,690
income this year of 0.

57
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,280
So looking at it in the context of the balance sheet equation,

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:55,050
we paid no cash taxes we've got tax expense of $30,000,

59
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,760
and then our deferred tax asset associated

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,130
with this net operating loss carryforward

61
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,890
is going to go away at this point.

62
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,220
So that's sort of the good outcome, which is

63
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,420
we have income in the future.

64
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,940
Now, when do you think about it, if we have a $100,000 loss one

65
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,570
year, do you expect future profits

66
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,850
to be high in the coming years?

67
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,970
Probably not, unless there is something extraordinary

68
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,500
about that loss.

69
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,120
Losses tend to persist.

70
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,140
So once we have the $100,000 loss in one year,

71
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,910
we kind of expect maybe to have $100,000 loss the next year.

72
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,960
And so that brings up the issue of the valuation allowance

73
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,550
associated with deferred tax assets.

74
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,990
So again, deferred tax assets arise

75
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,910
when we think that future taxes payable

76
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,940
are going to be less than future tax expense, as in the example

77
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,960
we did a little bit ago, and as with net operating loss

78
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,320
carryforwards.

79
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,920
So

80
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,640
As we talked about earlier, deferred tax assets

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,740
are sort of like prepaid assets.

82
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,190
We in some sense have paid too much tax in the past,

83
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,200
so we're going to pay less tax in the future.

84
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,210
But the issue is, what happens if those losses persist and we

85
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,990
don't actually expect high future income?

86
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,770
So if there's not going to be income in the future

87
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,660
to use the deferred tax asset, then the deferred tax asset's

88
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,360
not going to be realizable.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,880
And if it's not realizable, we're

90
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,860
going to need to reduce that.

91
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,940
It's kind of like accounts receivable.

92
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,210
So we got some accounts receivable,

93
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,290
but we don't expect to collect it.

94
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,480
And we're going to reduce those deferred tax

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,610
assets by creating a valuation allowance, which is a contra

96
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,090
asset, and it's very similar to the contra asset

97
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,940
that we create for the allowance for doubtful accounts.

98
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,530
So going back to our deferred tax asset example,

99
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,360
so we have this $30,000 deferred tax asset.

100
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,980
And let's pretend that instead of getting $100,000 of income

101
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,050
in 2016, management does a forecast

102
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,600
and it expects that we're actually not going

103
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,540
to have any future income, or certainly not

104
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,400
enough future income to use the deferred tax asset.

105
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,060
So in that case, we're going to create this valuation

106
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,910
allowance, which is a contra asset,

107
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,410
and we're going to reduce the value of the deferred tax asset

108
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,520
by offsetting it with this valuation allowance.

109
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,760
And then to balance the balance sheet equation,

110
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,440
so if we create a valuation allowance,

111
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,120
that's going to mean additional tax expense.

112
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,550
And so again, the valuation allowance,

113
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,380
which is this contra asset, is similar to the allowance

114
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,590
for doubtful accounts.

115
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,490
So we create an allowance for doubtful accounts,

116
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,240
and that creates in terms of extra expense,

117
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,820
in terms of bad debt expense.

118
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,180
If we look at Goldman's footnote, again from 2016,

119
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,370
we see Goldman's has $427 million

120
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,770
in net operating losses.

121
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,270
Goldman has set up a valuation allowance for $115 million

122
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,770
of those NOLs.

123
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,780
And when you think about it, Goldman

124
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,050
is a highly profitable company.

125
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,650
Why would it be setting up valuation allowances for some

126
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,460
of their deferred tax assets?

127
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,520
And this is a little subtle, but remember,

128
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,850
Goldman operates around the world.

129
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,030
It operates in all 50 US states.

130
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,980
And it may be that it had a loss in say some state,

131
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,720
but because it never expects to have operations in that state

132
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,030
again, it's not going to have income in those states,

133
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,980
so that net operating loss carryforward in that state

134
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,280
or in that locality or in that country,

135
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,170
it's never going to be able to use it,

136
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,200
because it's not going to go back into that country

137
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,680
and earn income.

138
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,070
So that's intuition for why even an extremely profitable company

139
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,549
like Goldman might have some of a valuation

140
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,380
allowance associated with some of its deferred tax assets.

141
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,179
Now, this is a famous example.

142
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,590
This goes back to 2009 when Citigroup--

143
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,320
it alarmed a lot of the big US banks.

144
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,930
It was the time of the financial crisis.

145
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,750
And Citigroup, there were some concerns

146
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,490
that Citigroup was actually not going

147
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,650
to survive the financial crisis.

148
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:05,600
So this is a CNBC.com article from October of 2009,

149
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,910
and it talks about Citigroup might

150
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,890
have to write down about $10 billion

151
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,370
of deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter

152
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,770
according to banking analyst Michael Mayo.

153
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:22,020
And this news sent the shares down over 5%.

154
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,590
So this is accrual accounting.

155
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,390
And you kind of wonder, why did this

156
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,175
cause share prices to fall?

157
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:32,290


158
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,980
And the hint here is, when would a firm

159
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,410
have to write down deferred tax assets,

160
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,090
or when would it not be able to use them?

161
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,480
So as we were talking about before,

162
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,460
we can only use the deferred tax asset

163
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,660
if our future income is going to be positive.

164
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,780
And when a company writes down a deferred tax asset

165
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,100
or creates a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset,

166
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,130
the company is telling you it does not

167
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,750
expect high future income, so you

168
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,920
sort of getting bad news from the company.

169
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,270
And this is a rare case when the accounting system sort of tells

170
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,300
you that future income is going to be low.

171
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,900
So this is something that bothers the stock market,

172
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,380
because the accounting system and management is basically

173
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,940
saying, when this deferred tax asset is written down,

174
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,250
it's telling you that future income is

175
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,720
expected to be very low.

176
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,510
So deferred tax assets can only be

177
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,200
used to offset taxable gains, but if we

178
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,840
don't have taxable gains in the future,

179
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,210
the value of these deferred tax assets need to be written down.
