00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,375
PROFESSOR: In this session, we're

1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:05,110
going to talk about accounting for income taxes.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,033
Our objectives are threefold.

3
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:08,950
First of all, we're going to try to understand

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:15,720
how financial statements reflect taxes paid and taxes owed.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,760
And secondly, and importantly, we're

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,900
going to view firms' income tax disclosures

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,480
and their footnotes, and interpret those.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,110
And then finally, we're going to look at a couple of events

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,450
that affect income taxes.

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,830
First of all is tax law changes, second of all

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,770
is valuation allowances.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,170
So as motivation, or to provide a big picture overview,

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,760
remember that taxes are a significant use of cash,

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,820
both for companies, for firms, and for individuals.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,240
Your economics course talks about one way of maximizing

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,380
profits is to minimize costs.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,080
And taxes are a big cash cost.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,930
So if you're running a firm or as an individual,

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,620
you want to understand the impact of income taxes

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,800
on your decisions.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,360
First of all, if you buy an asset or you sell an asset.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,110
So those of you that have invested in stocks, there's

23
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,800
tax smart ways to invest in stocks, to buy them,

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,520
and to sell them.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,680
And there are other ways that are not as tax efficient.

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,860
Second is financing decisions.

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,230
Traditionally, interest on debt has been tax deductible,

28
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,770
whereas dividends on stock are not tax deductible.

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,000
So for financing, debt naturally has a tax preference.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,730
So it's more advantageous to finance with debt.

31
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,520
Finally, location decisions.

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,290
As many of you remember, Amazon started a bidding war

33
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,480
for their corporate headquarters.

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,070
And they basically were going to put

35
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,729
their corporate headquarters in the locality,

36
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,070
among other things, that gave them the most advantageous tax

37
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,570
treatment.

38
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,040
So you can do the same thing when you're running your firm.

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,510
Finally, as an investor-- and this is our focus here--

40
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,390
you want to read the financial statements

41
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,070
and understand future cash flows.

42
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,780
So future cash flows is what you use to value the firm.

43
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,670
And some of those future cash flows,

44
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,510
a lot of those future cash flows, are related to tax,

45
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,870
and you want to understand those.

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,240
So there's accounting income or book income.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,790
That's what we've been studying in this course.

48
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,585
Today we're going to talk about taxable income.

49
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:53,960
So they are two different things,

50
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,085
and we're just going to give you an intuition based

51
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:58,440
on marketable securities.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,460
So remember our example before, Eva corporation buys 100 Attila

53
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,810
bonds.

54
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,830
The price of those bonds goes up by $10.

55
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,560
Eva does not sell the bonds.

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,170
And then Eva is using trading securities

57
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,420
accounting on those bonds.

58
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,420
And in this example, we're going to assume a tax rate of 35%.

59
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,080


60
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,130
So based on GAAP, based on accounting income,

61
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,450
how much is Eva's accounting income?

62
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,530
Well she has 100 bonds, they go up by $10.

63
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,120
So 10 times 100, her book income, or accounting income,

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,170
is $1,000.

65
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,840
What's her tax expense?

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,140
Well the tax rate is 35%.

67
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:55,780
So 35% of $1,000, tax expense is $350.

68
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,550
Now let's think about taxable income.

69
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,650
So based on the US tax code, or the Internal Revenue

70
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,100
Service, IRS, what's Eva's taxable income?

71
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,310
Well from the perspective of the tax authority,

72
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,320
nothing's happened.

73
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,050
While the bonds have gone up in value,

74
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:21,709
the tax authority only taxes income when it appears in cash.

75
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,250
So what's her current tax payable?

76
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,200
Well she has no income.

77
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,120
35% of 0 is 0, so she's got no tax payable.

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,970
Notice now that there's a $350 difference between tax expense

79
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,980
and current tax payable.

80
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,460
We'll see in a few minutes, this is

81
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,380
what's called a deferred tax liability.

82
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,550
So our financial reports record a liability for $350.

83
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,940
And this is to reflect the fact that we expect that we're

84
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,160
going to have to pay tax when ultimately we sell the bonds,

85
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,550
and we ultimately make this $1,000 gain.

86
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,600
So in general, there's a difference

87
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,270
between accounting income and taxable income.

88
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,400
So companies, in general, do two types of accounting.

89
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,870
One is accounting income.

90
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,880
We've been talking about that, that's

91
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,660
for reporting to shareholders and other stakeholders.

92
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,000
And the second is taxable income,

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,310
which is for reporting to tax authorities.

94
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,160
So financial reporting reports investors

95
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,420
and other stakeholders.

96
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,270
That's the accounting and book income

97
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,820
that we've been studying in this class.

98
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,640
And as we've been talking about throughout the class,

99
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,560
that uses accrual accounting, so that's going to make estimates.

100
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,250
Taxable income or tax or returns, on the other hand,

101
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,830
report to the tax authorities.

102
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,340
Tax authorities like taxable income,

103
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,670
and taxable income, as a prior example shows,

104
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,010
is more like cash accounting.

105
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,960
So remember from earlier in the course,

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,500
we talked about the trade off between relevance

107
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,330
and reliability.

108
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,290
Financial reporting likes relevant income.

109
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,060
So they want timely income that gets

110
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,270
to investors and other stakeholders

111
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,870
in a timely fashion.

112
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,870
So accounting income is relevant.

113
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,380
Tax returns, on the other hand, the tax authorities

114
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,870
want something that's not going to be disputed a lot.

115
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,880
So when cash comes in, everybody can agree that cash comes in.

116
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,080
So cash accounting, as we talked about before, which

117
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,210
is much like tax accounting, is more reliable.

118
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,390
So the tax authorities choose the more reliable method

119
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,240
of reporting.

120
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,790
Now if you forget everything else from this session,

121
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,140
remember this.

122
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,200
This is a summary about what we've been talking about.

123
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,670
In general, accounting income or book income,

124
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,190
or the income that we've been studying,

125
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,410
is going to be different than taxable income.

126
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,930
We're going to do a lot of examples of this.

127
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,820
Because accounting income, in general,

128
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,020
is going to be different than taxable income,

129
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,000
tax expense on our financial reporting books

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,310
is going to be different than cash taxes

131
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,820
that we report to the tax authorities.

132
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:33,400
So as an aside, many of us are doing our taxes right now.

133
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,960
Remember that we pay cash in taxes to the US,

134
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,500
and to the extent that we have taxes withheld,

135
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,480
we're paying cash as we owe it to the government.

136
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,380
But then when we file our returns on April 15, or July

137
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,000
15, or whatever the date may be, we may owe a little bit more

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,010
to the IRS because we've been under withheld.

139
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,570
So some of this cash is going to be paid a few months later.

140
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,760
But we're going to think about taxes as a cash item,

141
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,520
even though there will be some little bit of delays

142
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,560
sometimes in paying taxes.

143
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,790
So again, the important point is that tax expense is not

144
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,560
equal to cash taxes.

145
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,140
Tax expense, on the income statement,

146
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,860
is an accrual number, just like every other expense

147
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,720
on the income statement.

148
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,160
An accrual, again, is an estimate of future cash flows.

149
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,159
And we're going to match that accrual to income

150
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,130
when it's earned.

151
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,340
But again, the key point is, keep in mind

152
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,990
that in general, accounting income is not the same thing

153
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,770
as taxable income.
