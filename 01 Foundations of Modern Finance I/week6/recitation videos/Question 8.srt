1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,730
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,470
look at diversification benefits of holding

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,280
a portfolio with many stocks.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,440
Let's assume that the average stock has a volatility of 35%.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,113
So that's a standard deviation.

6
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:17,030
Let's also assume that the average correlation

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,970
between pairs of stocks is 25%.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,620
And let's compute the following.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,390
Let's compute the volatility of equally weighted portfolio that

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,710
has just one stock, 20 stocks, and 500 stocks.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,100
Let's first derive the variance of Portfolio P, equally

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,880
weighted portfolio.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,250
So this is the sum of all possible combinations

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,560
of covariance between stock i and j with the weights

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,960
that we put into stock i and j.

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,470
So if we think of this variance-covariance metrics

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,500
where we have on the diagonal, the variance

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,980
of individual stocks and off diagonal elements

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,550
of the pair-wise covariances, then this

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,620
is just simply the weighted average

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,560
of all of these items in this matrix.

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,520
Again with the weights that we put in each of these individual

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,198
stocks, these w's.

24
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,990
Since we have an equally weighted portfolio

25
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,930
this w's are, each of them, just 1 over n.

26
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,600
And so this product is just 1 over n squared.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,740
So this variance becomes the sum of 1

28
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,190
over n squared multiplied by the pair-wise covariance

29
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,740
between stock i and stock j.

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,340
Now I'm going to break down this sum into the following two

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,330
sums.

32
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,030
One is the sum of this variance.

33
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,460
So visually if you think of this term, what

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,140
I'll try to do visually here is that I

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,720
will separate the variance, what I have here

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,830
on the main diagonal, from the covariances.

37
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,586
So I'm taking the variance.

38
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:52,750
And there are n of them.

39
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,490
And so 1 over n squared times all

40
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,870
of the sum of these variances plus 1 over n squared,

41
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:06,970
the remaining sum of all possible covariances here.

42
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,729
So notice that in this covariance term,

43
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,790
I'm saying that this is the first summation from i to n

44
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,160
and then the second summation from j to n.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,070
But I'm saying that j should not equal to i because these

46
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,000
are the ones that this would be the variance terms that I

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,610
separated into this first sum.

48
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,160
So now what I'm going to do further

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,100
is that I will factor out 1 over n first.

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,870
And then what is going to be remaining

51
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,820
here is 1 over n times the sum of the variances here

52
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,670
of all stocks from 1 to n.

53
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,670
And so this term right here in parentheses

54
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,080
is just the average variance.

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,210
We can think of it this way.

56
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,680
And we know because this equation

57
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,360
gives us what is the average volatility of stock

58
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,530
so we would know what is the average variance.

59
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,880
So similarly, here I will try to isolate the average covariance

60
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,625
in the second term.

61
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,000
So the average covariance is just

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,667
the sum of all of the covariance divided

63
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:04,500
by the number of the covariance terms that we have.

64
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,110
What is the number of this covariance terms here?

65
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,510
Well, again, so referring back to these matrix,

66
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,830
you can think of it as just the number of off diagonal elements

67
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,830
here.

68
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,090
And so if the total number of elements in this matrix

69
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,030
is just n squared, the number of diagonal elements

70
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,080
is n squared minus n.

71
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,170
And so therefore I'm isolating here 1

72
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,760
divided by n squared minus n.

73
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,120
So this is the number, again, of the covariance terms multiplied

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,883
by the sum of all of these covariance terms.

75
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:34,050
And that's what's remaining.

76
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,450
So it's n squared that we had before.

77
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,110
And I'm now multiplying here by n squared minus n

78
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,210
to offset this additional division

79
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,390
that I put here so that this represents

80
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,920
the average covariance.

81
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,300
Now so what we have is that the variance of this portfolio,

82
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,480
equally weighted portfolio, equals to one over n multiplied

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,007
by the average variance, plus this term which is

84
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,090
you can see that n squared is going to cancel out.

85
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,380
So it's 1 minus 1 over n.

86
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,810
So there's this term.

87
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,500
And then what I have in parentheses here

88
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,750
is just the average covariance.

89
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,540
And so therefore we have 1 over n times average variance

90
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,110
plus 1 minus 1 over n times the average covariance.

91
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,910
And again, we know both the average volatility here

92
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,910
there is a variance and the average correlation.

93
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,540
So we can compute the average covariance between the pairs

94
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,160
of stocks here.

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,830
Now once we know this expression,

96
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,680
now we can plug in n equals to 1, n equals to 20,

97
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,520
and n equals to 500, and to compute the variance

98
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,720
of these portfolios.

99
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,340
So let's work with this expression

100
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,490
to compute the volatility of equally weighted portfolios

101
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,790
of 1, 20 and 500 stocks.

102
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,340
So first let me compute the average variance and average

103
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,740
covariance from the information that we're given here.

104
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,500
So the average variance would be just

105
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,820
the average standard deviation that we're given, 35% squared.

106
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,550
And the average covariance would be the average correlation

107
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,910
which were given again, 25%, multiplied

108
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,210
by two standard deviations of the average standard deviations

109
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,710
of stock.

110
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,820
So 0.35 times 0.35.

111
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,890
And now so we know the average variance

112
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,890
and we know the average covariance, so we can compute--

113
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,690
we just simply can plug in n's for 1, 20 and 500

114
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,180
and compute the variances and standard deviations

115
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,970
of this respective portfolios.

116
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,600
When n equals to 1, this is the variance.

117
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,532
And the standard deviation of this portfolio would be 35%.

118
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:35,490
And it does make sense.

119
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,640
So if you look back at this equation, so if n equals to 1,

120
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,270
this term equals to 0 so this is not relevant.

121
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,380
And so this equals to 1.

122
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,470
And so this is just the average variance.

123
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,148
And so therefore, if we have just Portfolio 1 stock,

124
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:51,690
its standard deviation is going to be

125
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,640
equal to the average standard deviation of stock here, 35%.

126
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,550
When we have 20 stocks, this is the variance

127
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,620
that we can compute by plugging 20 in here.

128
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,500
And the standard deviation of this portfolio would be 18.77%.

129
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,220
When we have 500 stocks, the standard deviation

130
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,840
of this portfolio would be 17.55%.

131
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,250
So these are the volatilities of these three portfolios.

132
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,980
Now let's look at these numbers.

133
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,960
By combining as few as 20 stocks into a portfolio, equally

134
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,180
weighted portfolio, we were able to reduce the volatility almost

135
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,590
twice from 35% to 18.77%.

136
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,380
So this is a dramatic reduction in volatility,

137
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,410
and we get it by just combining as few as 20 stocks

138
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,930
in our portfolio.

139
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,180
Once we keep adding more stocks, we still

140
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,710
get the reciprocation benefits.

141
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,020
But they're not seemingly as large

142
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,060
as they're here in the very beginning

143
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,910
where we're combining just few stocks.

144
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,260
You can look at this from when we get from 20 to 500.

145
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,380
The reduction in volatility is just from 18.77% to 17.85%.

146
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,230
So this is again-- so there is a reduction here but seemingly

147
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,700
not as large as it is here originally.

148
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,730
And so therefore, the main lesson here

149
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,640
is that we get a lot of diversification benefits

150
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,840
by combining just a few stocks in our portfolio given

151
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,910
that the average correlation between returns

152
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,620
is not that large.

153
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,347
And so in this particular case, if it's 25%,

154
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:34,180
most of this reduction is driven by the fact

155
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,830
that we're combining a few stocks

156
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,230
and the average correlation between these stocks

157
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,000
is just 25%.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,160
And so, again, as we keep adding,

159
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,800
we don't get as much as we get initially

160
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,350
when we adding a few stocks.

161
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,850
Let's see what happens when we're

162
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,460
combining more and more stocks in our portfolio,

163
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,120
in other words, when n goes to infinity.

164
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,760
When n goes to infinity, the variance of this portfolio

165
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,990
is going to become equal to average covariance.

166
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,030
We could see it from this expression.

167
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,780
1 over n is going to go to 0 when n goes to infinity.

168
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,065
1 minus 1 over n is going to go to 1.

169
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,440
And so therefore, this expression

170
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,980
is just going to become average covariance.

171
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,480
And therefore the standard deviation

172
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,120
of the portfolio that has infinitely many stocks

173
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,850
would be the square root of the average covariance, which

174
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,600
would be 17.5%.

175
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
so as we're combining infinitely many stocks,

176
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,120
