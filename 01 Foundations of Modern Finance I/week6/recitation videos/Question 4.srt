1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,800
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,830
work with historical returns, and we will learn how

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,720
to compute measure statistics--

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,490
means, standard deviations, and correlations.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,600
We will work with the following three exchange-traded funds--

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,870
Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,750
ETF, and Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,140
Our sample will consist of monthly returns

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,070
and will cover the last decade, January 2010

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,520
through December 2019.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,180
Before we go ahead and compute statistics,

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,130
let me first tell you a few interesting facts

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,040
about these exchange-traded funds.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,610


15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,680
This is an example of a fact sheet for Vanguard Total Stock

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,510
Market ETF.

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,670
It shows a few interesting statistics.

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,020
First, it shows the number of stocks currently traded

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,879
on the US exchanges.

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,440
This number is 3,535 stocks.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,440
An interesting fact is that the number of publicly traded firms

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,510
in the United States has been declining over the past decade.

23
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,080
Second, we can see sector breakdown of the US economy.

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,420
Technology comprises a quarter of all publicly traded stocks

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,710
in the US.

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,490
Financial is in the second place,

27
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,910
health care in the third.

28
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,910
And, finally, here we can see the largest stocks

29
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,800
in the United States.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,350
As of March 31, 2020, Microsoft was first, Apple second.

31
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,540
Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook are the third, fourth,

32
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,910
and fifth.

33
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,360
Second ETF is a 20-plus year treasury bond ETF.

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,190
This ETF invests in long treasury bonds.

35
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,080
You can see that all of the top holdings

36
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,730
consist of treasury bond.

37
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,340
These are the bonds that at the time of issuance

38
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,950
have 30 years until maturity.

39
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,950
If you look at the current portfolio of holdings

40
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,490
as of July 9, 2020, these are the different maturities

41
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,370
on these long bonds that comprise

42
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,250
the portfolio of this ETF.

43
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,320
And, indeed, you can see that all of them

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,850
have more than 20 years to maturity.

45
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,800
Finally, the last ETF is the emerging markets ETF.

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,870
Here some of the interesting statistics

47
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,320
come from composition of countries in this ETF.

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,200
So you can see that China has almost 50%

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,920
of the entire holdings of this ETF,

50
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,460
followed by Taiwan, India, Brazil, South Africa, Russia,

51
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,380
and so forth.

52
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,590
You can see that sectoral breakdown in emerging markets

53
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,150
is a little different compared to the United States.

54
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,230
The first sector that has more than quarter of all holdings

55
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,260
is financials, followed by technology, consumer services,

56
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,110
industrials, and consumer goods.

57
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,740
Now that we have some color on these ETFs,

58
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:15,000
let's start working with data and compute basic statistics.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,300
This is the data file that gives us monthly returns,

60
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,990
so it starts from January 2010 and goes all the way

61
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:27,790
to December 2019.

62
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,760
The numbers in this file are percentage returns.

63
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:39,992
For example, in January 2010, VTI had a negative 3.5% return.

64
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:41,950
And so all of these numbers that are given here

65
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,320
are just percentages.

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,620
Let's start with sample mean.

67
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,840
Here I provide formulas so that we can easily

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,050
see what is it that we're trying to compute.

69
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,540
I will try to use directly the formulas and compute by hand

70
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,600
these statistics, and then I will show you

71
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,240
shortcuts and some of the formulas in Excel

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,720
that allow to compute some of these basic statistics

73
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,400
but more easily.

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,782
So let's start with the sample mean.

75
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:18,240
Sample mean, by definition, is just

76
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,440
the sum of all returns divided by the number of these returns.

77
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,930
So I'll first compute it by hand.

78
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,950
So I will say sample mean here, and I will first

79
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:37,890
add up all of the returns, for example, for VTI.

80
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,320
So this is the sum of all the returns.

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,860
And then I will divide it by the number of observations

82
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,130
that we have here.

83
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,115
So the number of observations we have is we

84
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:52,730
have 10 years and monthly returns, so it's 120.

85
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,620
So if we divide this by 120, this

86
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:03,510
will be the mean return that we had on VTI during the sample

87
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,310
period.

88
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,110
Now, another way to compute sample mean

89
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,580
is just to use average function in Excel.

90
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:19,100
So if we do this, we'd get exactly the same answer.

91
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,893
So we can see that the return is exactly the same.

92
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:25,060
So from now on, I will just use the average function

93
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,630
to compute returns.

94
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:38,870
So I'll say average here, and I will extend this

95
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,780
to the other two ETFs.

96
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,360


97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,370
So here we can see the following.

98
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,210
The average monthly return on the US entire stock

99
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:58,360
market on this ETF is 1.12% per month during this time period.

100
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,910
The long bond, the TLT ETF, the average return

101
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,353
was 0.65%, which is perhaps higher

102
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:10,020
than you would have thought because this

103
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,270
is a fixed-income instrument issued by the government.

104
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,840
And, finally, emerging markets produced 0.4% monthly return,

105
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,900
which is, during this sample period,

106
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,770
significantly below the monthly return that was produced

107
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,600
by the US stock market.

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,110


109
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,430
Now, next, let's compute sample variance and then

110
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,100
standard deviation.

111
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,670
So, first, this is just a reminder

112
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,700
of the formula for the sample variance.

113
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,290
And I will compute it first by just using this formula

114
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,430
directly just to show you how to do this by hand in Excel.

115
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,930
So you can see that we first have

116
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,850
to take the difference between the returns

117
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,620
and the sample mean, square it for every month,

118
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,810
then add it all up, and then divide it by t minus 1.

119
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,000
So what I will do here--

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,680
I'll just create another column for now.

121
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,410
And what I will do is that I will compute this difference

122
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,130
and square them.

123
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,400
So I'll take this, minus the sample

124
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,590
mean that I just computed, and I will square it.

125
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,930


126
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,240
I will extend this array.

127
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,550
Now I will add up these numbers that I just computed,

128
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,680
the squared differences.

129
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,320
And then I will divide this number by 119

130
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,600
because, remember, we have 120 observations here.

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,410
So 120 minus 1 is 119.

132
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,630
119, by the way.

133
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,410
So we are subtracting 1 because we already

134
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,690
estimated one statistic, which is the sample mean,

135
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,280
so we are losing one degree of freedom.

136
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,320
And so this would be the sample variance of returns here.

137
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,850
If I wanted to take the standard deviation,

138
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,750
I will take the square root of this.

139
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:14,260
So I will say square root of this number.

140
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:20,510
And this will be the sample standard deviation of returns.

141
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,720
Now, of course, there is a simpler way

142
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,680
of doing this in Excel.

143
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,500
So there is a function that does it for us.

144
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,620
So it's called STDEV, that's standard deviation,

145
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,380
dot S. So this is the sample one that

146
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,910
actually divides by t minus 1.

147
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:45,410
So if I do this and if I take all of the returns here,

148
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,010
next let's compute sample variance.

149
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,088
I will create some workspace for me here.

150
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:52,880
And the first thing that I would like to do

151
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,980
is I would like to use directly the formula

152
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,390
to compute the sample variance.

153
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,590
So I'll take the differences between monthly returns

154
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,868
and the estimated sample mean.

155
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:02,660
I will square them.

156
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,980
I will add them up, and then I will divide it by t minus 1.

157
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,700
So I will do it here.

158
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,930
So I'll take the difference between a return

159
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,390
in the given month minus the estimated sample mean.

160
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,020


161
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,470
And I will square this difference.

162
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,830


163
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:36,190
Now I will add up and sum up all of the squared differences.

164
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,990


165
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,330
And then I will divide this number by t minus 1.

166
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,930
So t in our case is 120.

167
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,296
Minus 1 is 119.

168
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:48,490
We are, by the way, dividing it by t minus 1

169
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,790
because we already used this data to estimate sample mean.

170
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,910
So we're losing one degree of freedom

171
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,200
when we're estimating the second moment of the variance here.

172
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,260
And so this number right now, so 13.873,

173
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,660
this is sample variance.

174
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,080
For us to get sample standard deviation,

175
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,840
I'm just taking the square root of this variance.

176
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,975
And this is the number right now.

177
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:20,320
Now, there is, of course, much easier way in Excel

178
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,610
to do the same calculation.

179
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,920
So all I have to do is that I can use STDEV.S function.

180
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,520
So this is the function that computes sample standard

181
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,030
deviation.

182
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,480
So if I do this and I just simply take

183
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,960
the old area of returns, I hit Enter,

184
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,620
I get exactly the same number.

185
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:47,800
So the standard deviation of returns on VTI is 3.725%.

186
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,685
And so now I'll just delete this here.

187
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:52,060
I showed you how to compute this.

188
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,310
Now we can just directly use this function

189
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,140
for the rest of the ETFs.

190
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:06,940
So I will say this is sample standard deviation.

191
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,940


192
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,130
And since we computed this for VTI,

193
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:20,490
we can extend this to compute it for the other two ETFs.

194
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,990
So, very interestingly, you can see that the sample standard

195
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,070
deviation for the long bond ETF is

196
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,580
almost the same as for the stock market in the United States.

197
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,120
So the returns on long bond are quite volatile.

198
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,050
And, again, you can also see that the standard deviation

199
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,900
on the returns on the emerging market

200
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,810
is actually quite a bit higher than the standard deviation

201
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,990
of returns in the United States.

202
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,920
Now, finally, let's compute covariance.

203
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,570
I'll first compute, again, covariance by hand

204
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,570
and then correlation by using the formulas here,

205
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,290
and I will do it for VTI and TLT.

206
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,780
So, first, I'll compute the differences

207
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,000
between monthly returns and estimated means on the two

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,500
ETFs.

209
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,380
I will multiply them, and then I will add them up.

210
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,190
So I will create just a little bit more,

211
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,750
again, workspace for me here.

212
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,050
So the first thing I will compute is these differences

213
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,410
and then multiply them.

214
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:30,330
So this is monthly return minus the estimated mean multiplied

215
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,735
by the same for the second ETF.

216
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:42,350


217
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,300
So this is computing the same product for every month.

218
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,810


219
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,700
Now I will add up this sum, so I will sum them all up.

220
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,200


221
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,670
And then I'll also divide it by t minus 1

222
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,460
or by 119 in our case.

223
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,680
And so now this number here is the covariance, or the sample

224
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,640
covariance between the total stock market in the US

225
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,510
and the returns in the long bond ETF.

226
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,440
You can see that this number is negative,

227
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,083
which means that there is negative covariance

228
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,750
and, hence, will be negative correlation

229
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,790
between the returns on these two financial instruments.

230
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,270
Now that we know the covariance, let us compute correlation.

231
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,093
So correlation will be just the covariance,

232
00:13:41,093 --> 00:13:43,510
which we'll have to divide by the two standard deviations,

233
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,677
which were already computed.

234
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:48,870
So we will take this number, and we will divide it

235
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:55,700
by the standard deviation of the first ETF and by the second--

236
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,470
by the standard deviation of the second ETF.

237
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,265
And, also, this is the correlation.

238
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:02,640
So you could see that correlation

239
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,880
is almost negative 50%.

240
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,310
Now, of course, there has to be another way of computing

241
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,760
this correlation, and we can simply

242
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,230
just use the CORREL function in Excel,

243
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,060
which does this job for us.

244
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,340
So if we do this first array--

245
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,450
so it requires two inputs, so the first array

246
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,320
and the second array.

247
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,632
So this is the first one, and now this is the second.

248
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:31,140
And when we hit Enter, we're going

249
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,710
to get exactly the same number.

250
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,540
The point of this exercise is to show you

251
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,910
that we can compute all of these statistics

252
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,400
by hand because we understand what the statistics are.

253
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,620
But then we can use built-in functions

254
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,510
to compute these correlations more automatically.

255
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,330
So this is the correlation between VTI

256
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:56,620
and TLT. I will delete this column for now because we don't

257
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,620
need it anymore, and I'll just use this function

258
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,700
to compute these correlations.

259
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,603
So this is the correlation between VTI and TLT.

260
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,020
The other correlation here-- we'll

261
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:16,860
compute the correlation between TLT and the emerging market

262
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,660
ETF, so this one.

263
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,890


264
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,910
And this is the secondary.

265
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:32,940
So this would be the correlation between TLT and VWO.

266
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,500


267
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
And the third correlation here would

268
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,090
be the correlation between VTI, so between the US stock market,

269
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,870
and the emerging stock market.

270
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,940
So CORREL and then I'm putting the first array

271
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:59,770
in and then the second array.

272
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,930
And this is the result.

273
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,580
So it paints us a very interesting picture.

274
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,730
So first is that there is very negative

275
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,100
and strong correlation, at least historical correlation,

276
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,120
between the returns on the total stock market in the US

277
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,620
and on the long bond.

278
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,750
Second, there is also low correlation, although a little

279
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:34,170
less between the returns on the bond ETF and the emerging

280
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,420
markets.

281
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,850
And the third fact and perhaps very interesting fact,

282
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,030
because you would have thought that maybe the returns

283
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,160
on the US stock market and emerging markets

284
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,000
are not very well correlated, what these numbers shows here

285
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,903
is that the correlation between the two is almost 75%,

286
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:54,570
which is a very significant correlation.

287
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,680
Means that US stock market, at least historical, again,

288
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,420
and emerging stock markets correlates very highly

289
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,569
with one another.

290
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,230
If you are a US investor and you're

291
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,140
looking to diversify your current portfolio,

292
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,690
let's imagine that you 100% invested in the US stock

293
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:22,250
market, and you would like to diversify your portfolio.

294
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,990
You might think that investing in the emerging stock market

295
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,990
is a good idea because it provides large diversification

296
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,160
benefits.

297
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,130
And it does because correlation is not exactly one.

298
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,320
However, there is still a high degree

299
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,980
of correlation between the US stock market and the emerging

300
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,030
stock markets.

301
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,990
Again, it was so, at least historically.

302
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,580
And if you really want to diversify,

303
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:52,100
you're much better off investing in the long-term bonds

304
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,150
or long-term ETFs, as indicated by these numbers

305
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:02,120
here in this TLT ETF, because of this low negative correlation

306
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,560
between the returns on the US stock market and on the US

307
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,500
long-term bonds.

308
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,000
