00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:03,140
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,990
learn how to find certainty equivalent

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,990
for an investor with a given utility function,

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,260
and for a given lottery or for a given investment opportunity.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,100
You are given the following lottery.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,420
With probably 0.1, the payoff is $80,000.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,230
With probability 0.3, the payoff is $20,000.

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:30,870
And with probably 0.6, the payoff is $5,000.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,290
If the investor has utility function u of x equal to x,

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,330
what is the riskless payoff that would

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,880
make her different between choosing

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,200
this particular lottery and the riskless payoff?

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,420
Then part b of this question gives you

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,970
an investor with a different utility function, which

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,480
is u of x equals x raised to the power of 1 over 2,

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,670
and asks you the same question.

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,430
And part c of this question gives you yet another investor

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,310
with utility function u of x equals to x raised

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,800
to the power of 1 over 3.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,860
In this question, we ask to find what in economics we referred

21
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,010
to as a certainty equivalent.

22
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,170
Let me define what it is.

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,950
Certainty equivalent is the smallest riskless payoff amount

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,220
that makes an investor indifferent between taking

25
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,060
a risky lottery or accepting this certain amount.

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,690
Mathematically, our utility from certainty equivalent

27
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,440
or from this guaranteed riskless payoff

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,780
should equal to the expected utility

29
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,710
that we'll get from engaging into this risky lottery

30
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,480
or risky investment.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,780
To find certainty equivalent for an investor

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,380
with a given utility function in a given lottery,

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,360
we need to do the following two steps.

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,070
Step number 1, find expected utility of investor

35
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,910
from this given lottery.

36
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,640
And step 2, find certainty equivalent

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,610
by inverting the utility function.

38
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,190
Let's find certainty equivalent for investor

39
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,390
in part a, investor with a linear utility function.

40
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,500
So step 1 is to find expected utility that this investor will

41
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,260
get from this lottery.

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,250
We have already learned how to do this in question number 1

43
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,340
of this recitation.

44
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,830
So the expected utility of this investor equals to 0.1 times

45
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,410
the utility of the first payoff, which

46
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,880
was $80,000, plus the probability of the second state

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,130
times the utility that we get of the payoff in the second state,

48
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,240
that's $20,000, plus the third probability or the probability

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,820
of the third state, multiplied by the utility of the payoff

50
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,030
that we get in this third state.

51
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,430
Since the utility function is linear,

52
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,280
this just becomes 0.1 multiplied by 80,000

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,630
plus 0.3 multiplied by 20,000, plus 0.6 multiplied by 5,000.

54
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,250
Computing this gives us the expected utility of 17,000.

55
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,700
So this is the expected utility of this investor

56
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,600
from this given lottery.

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,980
Now in step 2, we can find certainty equivalent.

58
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,620
The utility of the certainty equivalent

59
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,470
would equal to $17,000.

60
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,440
In the case of this investor, she

61
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,630
has a linear utility function.

62
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,130
So u of CE, which is equal to CE.

63
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,660
And so therefore, certainty equivalent for this investor

64
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,520
is just 17,000.

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,000
So therefore, this investor is indifferent between just

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,070
taking guaranteed $17,000, this is our certainty equivalent,

67
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,000
or playing this lottery.
