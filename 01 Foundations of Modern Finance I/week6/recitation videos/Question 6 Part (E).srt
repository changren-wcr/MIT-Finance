1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,040
PROFESSOR: So let's summarize this question.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,150
If we just invested our initial wealth into this clean energy

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,290
ETF, the returns on our investment

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,630
would have been either negative 25%

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,740
if the value declined by 25% or positive 25%

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,230
if the value increased by 25%.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,680
So this is the situation where we had no leverage.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,250
With leverage, if we borrowed $45,000

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,530
and invested the entire $65,000 into this ETF,

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,880
then if the value of ETF either increased by 25%

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,720
or decreased by 25%, our net investment returns

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:47,800
would have been either negative 85.25% or positive 81.25%.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,620
So this leverage magnifies both gains and losses

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,010
for our initial investment.

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,940
And that's the idea behind leverage.
