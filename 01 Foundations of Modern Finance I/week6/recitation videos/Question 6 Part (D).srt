1
00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:03,280
PROFESSOR: Now, assume on the contrary

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,390
that instead of increasing in value by 25%,

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,620
the value of this clean energy ETF declined by 25%.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,050
So in this case, what is the return on your portfolio?

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,420
Let's do exactly the same two steps, two calculations,

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,930
to answer this question.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,100
So first, let's compute the new asset value.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,790
So this is our original value, now declined by 25%.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,100
So the new value is $48,750.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,860
The net investment, then-- so this is the new asset value

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,810
minus your borrowed amounts--

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,823
so the net investment is $3,750.

13
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:46,240
And now we can compute the return.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,600
So the return is your net investments,

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,110
minus your original net investments, so

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,710
your initial wealth, divided by your, again,

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,040
initial net investment of $20,000.

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,520
This is negative 81.25%.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,480
So if the value of this ETF declines by 25%,

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,650
your returns in your portfolio, or your initial investment,

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,885
is negative 81.25%.

22
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:16,010
So that's very significant.

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,100
So this is a very highly negative number.

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,130
Remember that the return cannot go below negative 100%.

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,920
So now, the final calculation here

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,290
is that it computes exactly the same return on your investment

27
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,120
as a function of the leverage ratio of your portfolio.

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,520
So again, leverage investment return

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,780
equals to leverage ratio times the return

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,040
on the assets in your portfolio.

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,790
So in our case this is 3.25% multiplied by negative 25%.

32
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,370
So this is the decline in the value of our assets.

33
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,850
So this gives us negative 81.25%--

34
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,340
again, the same number as we've computed here manually.
