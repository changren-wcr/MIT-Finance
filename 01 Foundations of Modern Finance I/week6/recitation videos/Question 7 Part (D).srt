00:00:01,275 --> 00:00:04,160
PROFESSOR: Now suppose that the correlation

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,010
between returns on Stock A and Stock B

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,560
increases from 0.2 to 0.6.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,320
We're going to keep the same Portfolio P that invests 60

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,440
into A and 40 into B. And we will

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,740
try to compute the expected return on this portfolio

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,480
and the standard deviation.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,750
So first, let's answer the following question.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,470
Does the fact that correlation changed from 0.2 to 0.6

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,790
affect the returns on this portfolio?

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,000
The answer is that it doesn't.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,660
The expected return on the portfolio

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,030
only depends on the weights that we

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,400
put in the corresponding stocks and on the expected

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,200
returns on the stocks.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,480
It does not depend on how returns on different assets

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,590
could vary within that portfolio.

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,430
So therefore, expected return in this case

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,010
stays the same as it was before.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,380
In particular, it is 18%.

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,580
Now standard deviation, on the other hand,

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,560
for the Portfolio P, is affected because if we

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,970
look at the formula for the variance of Portfolio P,

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,450
we see that it obviously depends on the correlation of returns

25
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,010
between A and B. And so now, to compute the standard deviation,

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,230
what I will do is that everything else stays the same.

27
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,550
So the only term that changes in this equation

28
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,740
is the correlation term.

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,520
So instead of point 0.2, what it was before,

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,860
it is 0.6 right now.

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,120
And so I highlighted it in pink color.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,330
And so if it computes the variance of this portfolio

33
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,870
period now, given this new correlation,

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,872
it gives me 0.0388.

35
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:43,580
And so to compute the standard deviation,

36
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,350
I again have to take the square root of this term.

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,280
And so this gives me 19.7%.

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,730
So when correlation goes up to 0.6,

39
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,680
expect the return stays the same at 18%.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,530
But the standard deviation of the portfolio

41
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,990
increases from 17.1% to 19.7%

42
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,000
