1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,700
PROFESSOR: Let's consider another lottery.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,600
This lottery is similar to the original one in the sense

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,860
that it has the same expected payoff.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,630
And you can verify that.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,080
But it is more risky.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,770
So the standard deviation of the payoff of this lottery

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,180
is higher.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,580
You could see that the first one, the first payoff, I

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,390
increase it from $80,000 to $89,000,

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,110
and I've decreased the bottom one from $5,000 to $3,500.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,910
So this would make this lottery more risky.

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,530
What I want to understand here is

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,960
how the certainty equivalence changed for investor A, the one

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,140
with the linear utility function, and for investor C.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,080
This was the one who is the most risk averse here.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,880
Let's start with investor A. So first

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,900
we compute the expected utility that this investor gets

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,250
from this lottery.

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,880
So this would be $17,000.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,050
This is by construction.

21
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,230
I constructed this lottery to be as such.

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,650
Now, if we want to find certainty equivalent

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,650
for this investor, recall that this investor

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,040
has linear utility functions.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,370
So the certainty equivalent of this investor is just $17,000.

26
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,300
So therefore this investor is indifferent between taking

27
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,170
$17,000 and this lottery.

28
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,800
And therefore, these investor has exactly the same certainty

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,730
equivalent as with the previous lottery,

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,170
although these lottery is riskier.

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,330
This happens because this investor is risk neutral.

32
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:55,162
She doesn't care about the fact that these lottery is riskier.

33
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:56,620
And this is illustrated by the fact

34
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,150
that certainty equivalent for this investor is the same.

35
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,280
Now let's consider the next investor,

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,830
the one who is risk averse.

37
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,700
The expected utility from this lottery for this investor

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,520
is given by this equation.

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,930
If we compute this, this would give us 21.72.

40
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,727
Now, if you find the certainty equivalent--

41
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,310
so certainty equivalent is going to be

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,190
equal to 21.72 raised to the power 3,

43
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:35,450
and so this would be equal to $10,243.43.

44
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,220
So for this investor, the certainty equivalent decreases.

45
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,840


46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,700
And this is expected, because this investor is risk averse.

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,060
In this case, she's presented with a lottery that

48
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,390
has exactly the same expected payoff,

49
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,160
but it is a risky lottery.

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,240
And because this investor is risk averse,

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,550
it stands to reason that the certainty equivalent,

52
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,000
or the guaranteed amount that this investor will

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,320
be willing to trade for this lottery, decreases.

54
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,530
And this is what we see by doing these calculations.
