PROFESSOR: The second question asks
us, what is the leverage ratio of your portfolio?
Let's start again with the definition of leverage ratio.
So leverage ratio is the total asset value
that we have in our portfolio divided by net investments.
So the total asset value is $65,000.
This is how much we have invested in this ETF,
and our net investment is $20,000.
So this net investment is your own wealth,
or, also, we refer to it as equity of your portfolio.
So this ratio gives us 3.25%.
So the leverage ratio of this portfolio that we
constructed here is 3.25.
