0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820


1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:05,840
Let's find a risk premium for these investors.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,520
By definition, the risk premium pi is the fraction of wealth

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,220
that an investor is willing to lose

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,940
that makes her indifferent between a risky zero

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,870
expected return investment x and the sure loss pi.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,710
Mathematically, we can write it as follows.

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,110
Recall that the investment opportunity that we have

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,170
in this question is as follows.

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,060
So it said the positive 25% or negative 25%

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,870
would equal probabilities 1/2.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,680
So notice that this investment opportunity's zero

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,765
expected return investment.

13
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:47,020


14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,870
Let's first compute the expected utility

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,760
from investing into this project investment opportunity.

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,410
So by definition it's 1/2 times utility in the upstate.

17
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,390
So this is $1 multiplied by positive 25% return

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,350
plus another 1/2 multiplied by the utility of $1

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,720
and multiplied by 1 minus 25%.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,145
So this is our loss state.

21
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:14,880


22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,820
Given that the first investor has cube root utility function,

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,200
for her this expected utility becomes as such.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,450
1/2 multiplied by 1.25 raised to the power of 1 over 3

25
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,740
plus 1/2 multiplied by 0.75 raised the same power

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,180
of 1 over 3.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,880
And so this gives us 0.993.

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,170
Now knowing this expected utility,

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,270
we can compute the risk premium for this investor

30
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,770
from this equation.

31
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,710
So again, the utility function is cube root and the wealth

32
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,590
of this investor W is $1.

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,850
So this gives us this equation.

34
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,650
0.993 equals to 1 minus pi raised

35
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,990
to the power of 1 over 3.

36
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,410
All we need to do is to solve this equation for pi.

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,490
And this gives us 2.12%.

38
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,610
So therefore the risk premium required by this investor

39
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,070
for this investment opportunity is 2.12%.

40
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,500
In other words, this investor is indifferent between losing

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,500
for sure 2.12% of her initial wealth of $1

42
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,430
and engaging in this 0% expected return investment

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,220
opportunity that has a certain level of risk.

44
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,610
Now let's compute risk premium for investor

45
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,637
B. We started with the same exact equation.

46
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:57,470
The only difference right now is, of course,

47
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,230
the utility function.

48
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,580
So for this investor, the expected utility

49
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,860
from this investment opportunity is 1/2 multiplied by 1 minus e

50
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,790
raised to the power negative 1.25 divided

51
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,510
by 3 plus 1/2 multiplied by 1 minus e

52
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,870
raised to the power of negative 0.75 divided by 3.

53
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,310
So this equals to 0.281.

54
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,750
Now again, knowing this expected utility,

55
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,993
we can find the risk premium for this investor.

56
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:38,410
Again, we know the utility function and the initial wealth

57
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,050
is $1.

58
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,270
So therefore this gives us the following expression.

59
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,870
All we need to do is to solve this expression for pi.

60
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,550
Doing this gives us 1.04%.

61
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,190
So therefore, this is the risk premium

62
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,520
required by this investor for this given lottery.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,830
So in other words, this investor is

64
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,450
willing to lose for sure 1.04% of the initial wealth

65
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,980
$1, indifferent between that and engaging

66
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:21,470
in this 0% expected return risky investment opportunity.

67
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,380
Let's summarize.

68
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,190
When both investors A and B have initial wealth of $1,

69
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,380
investor A has a higher coefficient

70
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,980
of relative risk aversion compared to investor B.

71
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,310
Risk premium required by investor A

72
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,390
to invest into this lottery is also higher

73
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,680
compared to that of investor B.

74
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,070
So therefore, both relative risk aversion coefficient

75
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,710
and the risk premium line up in such a way

76
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,430
that if the coefficient of the relative risk aversion for one

77
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,330
investor is higher than that for another one,

78
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,000
the risk premium required for investing into this given

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,850
investment opportunity would also be higher

80
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,370
for the investor, would be higher coefficient

81
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,500
of relative risk aversion.

82
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,000
