00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840


1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,530
PROFESSOR: Suppose that you have $20,000 that you

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,160
would like to invest.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,770
You're very bullish on the future of clean energy,

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,660
and you found the following exchange traded fund, or ETF,

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,860
that you would like to invest--

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,090
iShares clean energy ETF, the ticker symbol ICLN.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,730


8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,890
But you are so bullish on the clean energy

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,540
that not only do you want to invest

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,710
all your wealth into this ETF, you

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,680
would want to borrow and invest borrowed money into this ETF

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,940
as well.

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,270
Your broker allows you to borrow up to $45,000,

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,363
giving you wealth of $20,000.

15
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:40,780
So what do you will do is that you

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,330
will borrow the full amount of $45,000,

17
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:49,630
and you will invest all of it into this ETF.

18
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,700
The first question asks us, what is

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,100
the weight on this ETF on ICLN in your portfolio?

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,830
By definition, the weight in your portfolio on ICLN would be

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,480
your position in this ETF, which is $20,000--

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,460
this is your initial wealth--

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,800
plus your borrowed funds divided by your total wealth,

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,570
or often referred to as the equity of your portfolio.

25
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:22,000
So your position divided by your wealth, by $20,000.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,420
So this gives us 325%.

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,500
So the weight on this ETF in your portfolio is 325%.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,220
We can also compute the weights that you have on the loan,

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,630
or the borrowed funds in your portfolio.

30
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,180
So you borrowed $45,000, hence a negative sign,

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,350
divided by your wealth.

32
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,450
So this gives us negative 225%.

33
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,660
Now, this indeed is a portfolio, because if we add up

34
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,340
your weight in this borrowed funds

35
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:57,570
plus your weight in this ETF, this gives us 100%.

36
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,090
And so recall that by definition,

37
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,490
weights in the portfolio have to add up to 100%.
