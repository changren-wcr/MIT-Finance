1
00:00:00,743 --> 00:00:02,660
PROFESSOR: Now, what is the standard deviation

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:08,840
of this portfolio Q that puts 90% into A and 10% into B?

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,082
Let's use, again-- this is the formula for the variance first,

4
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:13,790
and then we'll compute standard deviation

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,300
based on the variance, as we computed for this portfolio Q.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,820
So again, it's weight squared times the variance of A plus B,

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,690
weight that we put into B squared, times

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,810
the variance of the returns of stock B,

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,330
plus 2 times weights times standard deviation

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,689
of A, standard deviation of B, times the correlation.

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,490
So notice that I go back to correlation,

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,990
the original correlation coefficient

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,860
that we had between the two stocks, which is 0.2.

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,890
So I plug in all of the numbers, so 0.9 squared--

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,950
this is our weight, 90%, that we put in this portfolio Q,

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,040
into stock A, so 90% squared, times 20%

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,040
squared, plus 0.1 squared plus 0.25 squared plus 2 times

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,380
the two weights, so 0.9 and 0.1, times the standard deviation,

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,690
so 0.2, 0.25, times the correlation, so 0.2.

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,630
So this gives me 0.035.

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,210
And this is the variance of our portfolio Q. Taking

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,720
square root of that gives me the standard deviation

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,380
of this portfolio Q, which is 18.8%.

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,090
So what we have done in this question is,

25
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,400
we were able to construct a portfolio with a given expected

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,290
return that we want, which is 19.5%,

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,990
by putting 90% into stock A and 10% of our wealth into stock B.

28
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,840
And this particular portfolio Q has

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,100
a standard deviation of 18.8%.
