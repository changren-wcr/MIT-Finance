00:00:00,632 --> 00:00:02,090
PROFESSOR: In the next question, we

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,000
are asked to form the following portfolio.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,470
So we will mix or we'll invest 60% of our wealth

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,502
into stock A and 40% into stock B.

5
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,960
So we're going to form this portfolio which I will refer to

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,580
as P, which again invest 60% in a 40% in b.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,920
The question asks us to find the expected return

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,380
on this portfolio, P.

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,360
Let's do the definition of expected return

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,870
for a portfolio.

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,210
Expected return on a portfolio would equal to the weight

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,790
that we'd invest in the first stock times the expected return

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,820
on this stock, plus weight that we'd

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
invest in the second stock times the expected return

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,500
on the second stock.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,542
Now, if we've had more --

17
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,000
you could see that this is just a simple linear function --

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,820
so if we had more stocks in our portfolio,

19
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,290
we could just continue writing the following linear

20
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,890
expression.

21
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,680
So now since we have only two stocks

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
we can plug in the weights and the corresponding expected

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,620
returns.

24
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,530
So weights in a 60% expected return 20.

25
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,560
40% in b and it's expected return is 15%.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,030
So if we compute this, this will give us 18%.

27
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,500
So the expected return on this portfolio P is 18%.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,000
