00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,490
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,540
learn how to find the risk premium for an investor

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,630
for whom we know their utility function

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,060
and for a given investment opportunity

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,940
or for a given lottery.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,610
We will consider the following two investors, A and B,

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,280
with the following utility functions.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,250
You can verify that these utility functions are concave

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,930
and both of these investors are risk averse.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,240
There is an investment opportunity.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,098
That's with probability 0.5 with 25% return, positive 25%,

12
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:37,515
and with the remaining probability

13
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,810
of 0.5 returns, negative 25%.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,930


15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,930
We will start by assuming that both of these investors have

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,690
initial wealth of $1.00.

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,960
And first, we'll compute their coefficients of relative risk

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,970
aversion, evaluate it at the initial wealth.

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,850
Two, for both of these investors,

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,770
we'll compute the risk premium associated

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,260
with the above investment opportunity.

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,040
Let's start by computing the coefficient of relative risk

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,040
aversion for both of these investors.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,500
By definition, relative risk aversion

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,110
of a given investor with wealth W

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,630
is given by the following expression.

27
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,880
So it's negative wealth multiplied

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,680
by the second derivative of the utility function.

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,850
Evaluate it at W. Divide it by the first derivative

30
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,120
of the utility function.

31
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,230
Evaluate it, W.

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,660
Let's start with the first the investor.

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,310
Her utility function is this.

34
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,490
It's X raised to the power 1 over 3.

35
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,130
And what we need to do, we need to compute

36
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,540
the first and the second derivative of this utility

37
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,040
function.

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,700
So that we can compute the coefficient,

39
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,110
the relative risk aversion.

40
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,110
So the first derivative of this utility function

41
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,450
is given by the first part of this expression,

42
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,390
and then the second derivative we can compute

43
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,100
is given by the second part.

44
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,680
Plugging both of these expressions

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,440
into the definition of relative risk aversion

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,090
gives us the following, which, if we compute,

47
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,530
just gives us 2/3.

48
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,090


49
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,940
Therefore, the coefficient of relative risk aversion

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,970
of investor A is just 2/3.

51
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,700


52
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,130
Now, let's do the same for investor B.

53
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,030
This is investors B utility function,

54
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,130
so the first step is, again, to compute

55
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,958
the first and second derivative of the utility function.

56
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,750
And these are the expressions for the first

57
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,630
and the second derivative.

58
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,140
Plugging both of these into the definition

59
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,690
gives us the following expression.

60
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:04,270
If we compute this, we would get 1/3 multiplied by W.

61
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,510
And since the question asks us to evaluate the coefficient,

62
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,760
the relative risk aversion for both of these investors

63
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,190
at the points of the initial wealth,

64
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,320
we need to plug-in W into this equation for investor B.

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,263
So given that her wealth is $1.00,

66
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:23,930
this gives us the coefficient of relative risk aversion for this

67
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,150
investor of just 1/3.

68
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,225
So to summarize so far, investor A

69
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:34,720
has a higher relative risk aversion coefficient,

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,080
and it equals to 2/3.

71
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,570
And investor B has a lower relative risk aversion

72
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,350
coefficient, and it equals to 1/3.

73
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,500
Both of which are evaluated at the initial wealth of $1.00.

74
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,000
