1
00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:02,570
PROFESSOR: Now in the second part of the question,

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,990
we have the same investor with the same utility function.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,360
But now, she has a choice between the following two

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:08,860
lotteries.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,510
Lottery A is the same exact lottery

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,810
we had in the first part of this question,

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,540
and Lottery B. So a Lottery A with probability 1/2

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,010
pays $1,100 and probably 1/2 pays $900.

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,370
Now lottery B with probability 1/2

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,100
pays $1,250, with probability 1/2 pays $750.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,380
Now the question is which of these two lotteries

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,110
this investor will choose.

13
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,450
Now let's compute the expected utility that this investor will

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,400
get from Lottery A and Lottery B.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,720
We've already done this calculation for Lottery A.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,840
So the expected utility equals to 1/2 the utility of $1,100

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,630
plus the other half utility of $900.

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,250
This gave us 31.58.

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,410
Now let's do the same calculation for Lottery B.

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,650
So the expected utility equals to 1/2 utility

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,520
of $1,250 plus the other half utility of $750.

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,260
So the utility function, again, is the square root function.

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,400
So it's 1/2 square root of $1,250

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,340
plus 1/2 square root of $750.

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,040
That gives us 31.37.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,820
So given these two expected utilities,

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,270
which of the two lotteries our investor prefers?

28
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,950
Well, since Lottery A gives her a higher expected utility

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,560
compared to Lottery B, then this investor

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,150
is going to prefer Lottery A to Lottery B.

31
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,690
The reason for this choice is exactly the same reason

32
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,960
as we had in the previous part of this question.

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,390
Both of these lotteries A and B offer

34
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,710
the same exact expected payoff.

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,070
So it's $1,000 in both cases.

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,850
You could see the symmetry of these outcomes.

37
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,490
However, there is more uncertainty

38
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,060
and more risk in the Lottery B because the outcome

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,470
is more dispersed.

40
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,240
So it's $1,250 or $750 while the first one is either

41
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,600
$1,100 or $900.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,130
And just because this investor is, again, risk averse,

43
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,710
his utility function is concave, this investor

44
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,710
would prefer to take less risky lottery

45
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,490
that offers the same expected payoff.

46
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,460
And so therefore, she chooses Lottery A

47
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,670
in this particular case.
