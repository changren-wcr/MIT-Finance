00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260


1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,320
Finally, let's find certain equivalent

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,390
for the third investor.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,620
Recall that this investor has utility function x raised

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,210
to the power of 1 over 3.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,330
We will do exactly the same two steps

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,710
as we have done in the part a and part b of this question.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,763
So Step 1, we're starting with the same equation.

8
00:00:22,763 --> 00:00:24,180
The only difference right now will

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,370
be that the utility function is different

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,910
and so therefore $80,000 will have

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,040
to be raised to the power of 1 over 3.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,740
So $20,000 will have to be raised

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,150
to the same power, 1 over 3.

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,130
And $5,000 will have to be raised

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,910
to the power of 1 over 3.

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,720
Computing this gives us expected utility

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,100
for this investor of 22.71.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,200
And now in Step 2, we can find certainty equivalent.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,620
So we need to solve this equation.

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,560
So u of CE equals to 22.71.

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,000
u of CE equals to CE raised to the power of 1 over 3.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,790
Because this is just our utility function.

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,040
That equals to 22.71.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,640
So therefore CE equals to 22.71 raised to the power of 1/3.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,600
And this equals to 11,715.61.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,010
So therefore this investor is indifferent between taking

27
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:36,850
$11,715.61 and playing this lottery.

28
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,580
Let's conclude and summarize what we've learned so far.

29
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,820
We're given three investors.

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,030
Investor A is risk neutral because she

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,840
has a linear utility function.

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,660
Both investors B and C are risk averse,

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,880
because they have concave utility function.

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,400
Investor C is more risk averse than investor B.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,570
So therefore if all three investors

36
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,990
are presented with the same lottery,

37
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,560
we would expect that certainty equivalent of investor A

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,380
would be higher than that of investor B

39
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,140
which in turn will be higher than that of investor C.

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,940
And this is exactly what we found.

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,550
Investor A is willing to trade the lottery

42
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,650
for a guaranteed payoff or certainty

43
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,220
equivalent of $17,000.

44
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,490
Investor B is he's willing to trade off

45
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,282
this exact same lottery for $12,800.

46
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,240
So the difference between certainty equivalence

47
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,210
of investor A and investor B shows you

48
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,370
how much more risk averse investor B

49
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,610
is compared to investor A.

50
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,247
And certainly equivalent of investor B

51
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:51,330
is greater than certainty equivalent of investor C

52
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:57,150
which is $11,716, which again is due to the fact

53
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,980
that investor C is more risk averse than investor B

54
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,960
and is willing to trade this lottery for a lower guaranteed

55
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,510
amount.
