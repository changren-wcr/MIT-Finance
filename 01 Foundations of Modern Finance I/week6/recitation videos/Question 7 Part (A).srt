00:00:00,332 --> 00:00:01,790
PROFESSOR: In this question, we are

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,680
given two stocks, stock A and stock B,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,440
with the following properties.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,100
Stock A has expected return of 20%.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,580
Stock B has expected return of 15%.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,930
Standard deviations are 20% and 25%, respectively.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,350
The correlation between the returns on stock A and stock B

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,580
is 0.2, or 20%.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,200
The first question asks us whether any investor would ever

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,490
invest in stock B. And this is a reasonable question

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,970
to ask because if you look at the properties of stock B

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,840
and compare them to stock A, stock B looks, indeed,

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,380
on its own, inferior to stock A. So it has lower

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,360
expected return, and it has a higher standard deviation.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,650
So hence, the question, would ever any of the investor here

16
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,350
would ever invest into stock B?

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,150
And the answer is yes.

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,230
Because of its low correlation with stock A,

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,379
this stock, although on its own inferior,

20
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,530
may provide diversification benefits.

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,230
And hence, a rational investor may

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,930
want to invest a fraction of his or her own wealth into stock B

23
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,190
to get these diversification benefits.
