00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140


1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,610
PROFESSOR: Now let's assume that Portfolios P and Q get

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,690
combined.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,650
They get combined into a new portfolio.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,770
And we'll call this portfolio R.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,820
So for example, imagine that P and Q are trusts

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,440
and they just combined and merged.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,580
And they combined their assets.

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,170
And so all of these assets get combined into portfolio R.

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,850
And now the question is, what are

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,820
the new weights of these individual assets

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,995
in this new portfolio, in the merged portfolio,

12
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:31,220
R. To find the weights of individual assets

13
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,860
in this new Portfolio R, first, let's

14
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,040
find the total value of Portfolio R.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,713
So we're simply adding up the value

16
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:40,130
of each of these individual assets

17
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,160
or because we knew the value of Portfolio P

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,970
and the value of Portfolio Q so $75,000 and $70,000

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,050
respectively.

20
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,180
So the total value of this combined portfolio right

21
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,030
now is $75,000 plus $70,000.

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,400
That's $145,000.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,430
So that's the total value of Portfolio R.

24
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,310
To find the weights, we're simply

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,099
adding up the weights of individual positions

26
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,650
in Portfolios P and Q and dividing it

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,830
by the total value of the new portfolio.

28
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,530
So $25,000 for SPY in Portfolio P

29
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,220
plus $10,000 for SPY in Portfolio Q.

30
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,240
So that's $35,000 divided by $145,000.

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,090
And that's 0.24.

32
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,820
Same exact process for the remaining three assets.

33
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,530
So for the short term treasury ETF $35,000

34
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,530
here plus $10,000 here divided by $145,000.

35
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,330
That's 0.31.

36
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,850
For emerging markets ETF, $15,000 here, $30,000 here,

37
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,470
divided by $145,000, also 0.31.

38
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,130
And for the mortgage backed securities ETF, $0 here,

39
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,270
$20,000 here divided by $145,000.

40
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,600
That gives us 0.14.

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,530
And so these are the weights of each

42
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,290
of the four individual securities

43
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,320
in this new portfolio, combined portfolio, are.

44
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,860
Again, just to make sure that we haven't done arithmetic

45
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,669
mistakes somewhere, to make sure that that didn't happen,

46
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,120
we add up the weights of individual assets

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,610
and just make sure that it all adds up to 1.

48
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,250
And in this case, it indeed all adds up to 1.

49
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,460
So this portfolio looks OK.

50
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,290
So all of the weights add up to 1.

51
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,760
And this is how you compute portfolio weights given

52
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,770
the position and individual assets in a portfolio.
