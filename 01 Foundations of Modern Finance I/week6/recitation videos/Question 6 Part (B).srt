PROFESSOR: The second question asks

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,450
us, what is the leverage ratio of your portfolio?

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,820
Let's start again with the definition of leverage ratio.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,780
So leverage ratio is the total asset value

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,830
that we have in our portfolio divided by net investments.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,170
So the total asset value is $65,000.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,800
This is how much we have invested in this ETF,

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,650
and our net investment is $20,000.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,590
So this net investment is your own wealth,

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,390
or, also, we refer to it as equity of your portfolio.

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,290
So this ratio gives us 3.25%.

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,660
So the leverage ratio of this portfolio that we

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,500
constructed here is 3.25.

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,000
