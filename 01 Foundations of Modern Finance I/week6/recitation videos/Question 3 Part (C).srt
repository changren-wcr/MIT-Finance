00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380


1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,760
PROFESSOR: Let's now assume that both of these investors

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,480
got richer.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,220
Their wealth was $1.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,090
Right now their wealth is $5.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,610
We will repeat the same calculations.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,850
So we'll compute the coefficients of relative risk

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,650
aversion for both of these investors given

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,550
their new wealth.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,270
And we will compute the risk premium associated

10
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,880
with this risky investment opportunity

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,680
that we are considering in this question.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,710


13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,420
Recall that the relative risk aversion that we can computed

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,330
for investor A was just 2/3.

15
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,180


16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,440
Notice something very important.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,410
This coefficient, the relative risk aversion for this investor

18
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,480
does not depend on her wealth.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,830
It's 2/3 regardless of how rich this investor is.

20
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,530


21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,730
This is what we call constant relative risk aversion.

22
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,690


23
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,530
The risk aversion of this investor

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,730
does not depend on how wealthy she is.

25
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,340


26
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,060
For Investor B, however, the relative risk aversion

27
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,360
does depend on the wealth of this investor.

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,410
Recall that the relative risk aversion of this investor

29
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,390
was 1 over 3 multiplied by wealth w.

30
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,780
So when wealth is $5, the relative risk aversion

31
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,325
of this investor is 5/3.

32
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:36,050


33
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,530
So generally for this investor, risk aversion

34
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,790
increases as this investor gets richer.

35
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,310
Now let's compute the risk premium for investor

36
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:54,310
A. First we're computing the expected utility this investor

37
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,520
gets from this lottery.

38
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,970
It's the same expression as we had before,

39
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,920
but right now instead of $1, we have $5.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,500
This is our current wealth.

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:14,930
Computing this gives us the expected utility of 1.698.

42
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,218
And now we can compute the risk premium

43
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:18,635
by solving the following equation.

44
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:23,640


45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,020
So recall that the utility function of this investor

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,370
is cube root.

47
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,200
And the wealth right now is $5.

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,470
Solving this equation for pi gives us 2.12%,

49
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,230
this is exactly the same 2.12% as we had before.

50
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,250
So now, given the higher wealth of these investors, so $5,

51
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:57,450
this investor has still required risk premium of 2.12%.

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,300
And in fact, this risk premium would not

53
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,820
depend on the level of wealth of this investor.

54
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,300
Just because the risk aversion of these investors

55
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,820
does not depend on her wealth.

56
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,130


57
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,160
Now for Investor B, we have the same expression.

58
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,680


59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,590
Using the utility function of this investor,

60
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,860
we can compute that the expected utility from this lottery

61
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,090
is 0.794.

62
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,580
To compute the risk premium, we're solving this equation.

63
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,220
We know the utility function.

64
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,760
We know w, which is $5.

65
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,370
Plugging this in gives us this equation,

66
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,150
which we need to solve for pi.

67
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:52,270
Solving this equation for pi gives us 5.06%.

68
00:03:52,270 --> 00:04:00,000
And so given the wealth of $5, this investor right now

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,630
has a risk premium of 5.06%.

70
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,040
Let's summarize.

71
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,840
Investor A has a constant relative risk aversion.

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,500
Regardless of whether her wealth is $1 of $5,

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,959
the coefficient of relative risk aversion of this investor

74
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,820
is just 2/3.

75
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,390
Regardless of how rich this investor is,

76
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,360
the risk premium associated with this particular investment

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,440
opportunity is 2.12%.

78
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,040
For any other level of wealth, it will always stay constant

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,380
at the same exact level.

80
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,600
Risk premium, of course, would differ

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,670
if we give this investor a different investment

82
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,870
opportunity.

83
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,350
That investment opportunity may have a different risk premium.

84
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,120
But for this particular investment,

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,390
for any level of wealth, risk premium stays constant.

86
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,300
But investor B, the richer this investor becomes,

87
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,370
the more risk averse she gets, is

88
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,560
indicated by increasing relative risk aversion coefficient.

89
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,100
When her wealth is $5, the coefficient

90
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,230
of relative risk aversion is 5/3,

91
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,890
which is higher than that of investor A

92
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,960
at that level of risk.

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,700
And so therefore when you compare

94
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,890
risk premium for investor A and B,

95
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,890
when they both have wealth of $5,

96
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,110
the risk premium required by investor B

97
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,410
is higher than that of investor A.

98
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,240
Finally, as Investor B becomes richer,

99
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,120
her relative risk aversion increases and so does

100
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,330
the risk premium she requires from investing

101
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,380
into this lottery.

102
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,570
You could compare the first case when she's--

103
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,980
when her wealth is $1 and her risk premium

104
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,780
is 1.04% to the case when her wealth is $5 and the risk

105
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,480
premium is 5.06%.

106
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,460
This risk premium will continue rising

107
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,300
as this investor gets richer.
