00:00:00,746 --> 00:00:02,700
PROFESSOR: In this next question,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,990
we are asked to construct a portfolio

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,570
with expected return of 19.5%.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,253
I will call this Portfolio Q. So we

5
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:12,670
want to construct a portfolio such

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,380
that expected return is 19.5%.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,560
So let's again start with just the expression

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,970
for the expected return of the portfolio.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,730
So expected return of the portfolio

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,570
Q equals to the weight that we put into A times

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,180
the expected return of stock A plus the weight that we

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,980
put into B times expected return on stock B.

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,480
Now notice that by definition of a portfolio, weight

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,270
A plus weight B has to add up to 1.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,490
So here I will write an expression of for a weight B

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,850
as the function of weight A. And I will plug this

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,100
into the above equation.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,690
So this is going to give me expected return for Portfolio Q

19
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,510
as the function of weight we put into weight times expected

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,610
return on stock A plus 1 minus weight that we put into A times

21
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,220
expected return of stock B. And now we

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:15,490
want to make this expression equal to 19.5%.

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,715
So now I'm going to plug in expected returns for stocks A

24
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:22,480
and B from what's given, so 20% and 15%.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,860
And this becomes just an equation with one unknown.

26
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,740
So we can solve it for wA.

27
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,650
And this gives us 90%.

28
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,250
So therefore to construct a portfolio that gives us

29
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,110
expected return of 19.5%, we put 90% of our assets

30
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,710
into stock A and the remaining 10%,

31
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,897
because again, weights have to add up to 1

32
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:48,730
and we have only two stocks so the remaining

33
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,420
10% we put into stock B. So Portfolio Q

34
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,160
would be 90A and 10B.

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,000
