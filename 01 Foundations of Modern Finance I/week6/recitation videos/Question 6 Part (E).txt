PROFESSOR: So let's summarize this question.
If we just invested our initial wealth into this clean energy
ETF, the returns on our investment
would have been either negative 25%
if the value declined by 25% or positive 25%
if the value increased by 25%.
So this is the situation where we had no leverage.
With leverage, if we borrowed $45,000
and invested the entire $65,000 into this ETF,
then if the value of ETF either increased by 25%
or decreased by 25%, our net investment returns
would have been either negative 85.25% or positive 81.25%.
So this leverage magnifies both gains and losses
for our initial investment.
And that's the idea behind leverage.
