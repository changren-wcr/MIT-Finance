00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,120
PROFESSOR: Now suppose that you were right,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,100
and the value of this EFT--

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,620
so the value of clean energy EFT--

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,840
increases by 25%.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,550
The question is, what is the return on your investment?

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,390
Let's answer this question.

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,920
First, I will compute the total asset value of your portfolio.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,230
So recall that we have $65,000 invested into this ETF.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,910
So this asset value right now increased by 25%.

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,540
So the new value is $81,250.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,130
Now, of this, $45,000 is borrowed.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,310
So therefore, the new value of your net investment

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,290
is the new asset value minus this borrowed amount.

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,080
This gives us $36,250.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,140
So therefore, you have invested $20,000.

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,110
And right now, your net investment is $36,250.

17
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,680
So now we can compute the return.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,080
So the return is the new value of your net investment

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,020
minus the original value divided by the original value.

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,790
And so this gives us 81.25 percent return.

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,530
So therefore, if the energy ETF increased in value by 25%,

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:27,250
the value or the return on your investment is 81.25 percent.

23
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,680
Now let me show you an alternative way

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,990
of doing the same calculation.

25
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,270
Recall that the leveraged investment

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:40,600
return equals to the leverage ratio times the asset return.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,320
So this is the overall change in the value of your portfolio.

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,210
And so in this case, our leverage ratio

29
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,540
that we computed before was 3.25.

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,360
And now, we are multiplying by how much the asset

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,730
value or our ETF has changed.

32
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,470
This is 25%.

33
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,892
And so this gives us 81.25 percent return.

34
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:02,350
And this exactly matches the number

35
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,720
that we've computed up here.

36
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,660
So this is one of the major benefits

37
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,360
of knowing the leverage ratio of your portfolio

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,730
because it allows you to quickly understand, and approximate,

39
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,370
and measure by how much the value

40
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,540
of your original investment has changed

41
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,170
as a function of how much the total value of assets

42
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,830
changes in your portfolio.

43
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,923
So in this case, the value of assets increased by 25%.

44
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,590
And because we have a leveraged position

45
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,720
and this is our leverage, we have the net investment gain

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,160
of 81.25 percent.
