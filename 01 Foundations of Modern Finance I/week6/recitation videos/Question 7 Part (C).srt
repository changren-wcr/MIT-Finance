00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,040
PROFESSOR: The next question asks

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,845
us to find the standard deviation of this portfolio P.

3
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:11,830
So recall that this portfolio P put 60% into A and 40% into B.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,890
So let's write down the expression for the variance

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,420
of a portfolio of two stocks.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,300
So the variance of this portfolio, RP

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,970
equals to the weight that we put in the first stock,

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,910
stock A, squared, times the variance

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,390
of the returns of stock A, plus weights

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,100
that we put into stock B squared times the variance of stock B

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,210
plus 2 times weights that we put into A and B

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,200
times the covariance of the returns between stocks A and B.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,290
In this question, we're given the correlation of returns

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,450
between A and B. So what I will do

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:52,330
is, I will expand this equation, where I will express covariance

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,880
of the function of standard deviations of returns of stocks

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,570
A and B and their correlation.

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,600
So the first two terms remain the same.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,770
The third term becomes 2 times the weights

20
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,560
times the standard deviation of the returns on A times

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,810
the standard deviation of the returns on B,

22
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,520
times the correlation of the returns between the two stocks.

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,320
So this is just the definition of the covariance.

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,480
Now we're ready to plug in all the numbers.

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,360
So the weights are 60% and 40%, so it's

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,000
0.6 squared, 0.4 squared, multiplied

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,170
by the variance of the returns of stock A, which

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,340
is standard deviation 0.2, 20%.

29
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,200
Then it means that the variance is 20%, or 0.2 squared.

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,280
0.25 for stock B, so 0.25 squared--

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,590
this is the variance of stock B.

32
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,070
And this third term is the covariance

33
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,070
of the correlation term.

34
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,640
So it's 2 times the weights times two standard deviations,

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,510
so 0.2 and 0.25, times the correlation

36
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,260
of the returns between stocks A and B. So this is 0.2.

37
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:06,010
So when you compute this, we get 0.0292.

38
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,860
And so this is the variance of the portfolio

39
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,753
P. Since the question asks us to find the standard deviation--

40
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:14,170
so what we do is that we're taking

41
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,600
the square root of this variance, and we get 17.1%.

42
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,430
So this is the standard deviation

43
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,710
of the returns of the portfolio P, which invests 60% into stock

44
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,500
A and 40% into stock B.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,000
