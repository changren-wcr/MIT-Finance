00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,310
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will learn what is a portfolio

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,600
and how to compute portfolio weights.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,460
Suppose that you're a financial advisor

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,260
and you have the following two clients,

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,690
client P with a portfolio P, and client Q with a portfolio Q.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,910
Client P has the following securities in her portfolio,

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,250
she invests $25,000 in SPY, which

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:31,550
is ETF that tracks S&P 500 Index, 35,000 into this ETF,

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,710
this is ETF, Vanguard's ETF, that

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,000
tracks returns on short term Treasury securities,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,600
and $50,000 into this ETF, this is

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,510
iShares ETF that tracks return of emerging markets.

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,440
Now client Q has the following portfolio, so $10,000

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,550
invested in SPY, so same ETF, $10,000 invested

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,910
in this short term Treasury ETF, 30,000

16
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,270
is invested in this emerging markets ETF,

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,110
and 20,000 invested into this additional ETF that

18
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,930
tracks returns on mortgage backed securities.

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,800
So notice that client P does not have

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,760
MBB or this ETF in her portfolio but client Q does.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,330
So the first question that we'll answer here

22
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,780
is that we'll compute portfolio weights that clients P

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,180
and Q have on each individual securities in their portfolios.

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,990
Let's start with client P. So first to compute

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,320
the weights of each of these individual ETFs

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,350
in her portfolio, first step is to compute the total value

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,830
of her portfolio.

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,580
So this is just weighting up the total asset

29
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:49,160
value of each individual ETF, this gives us $75,000.

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,270
Then to compute the weight that SPY has in her portfolio

31
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:58,760
we're taking the value of SPY in her portfolio, so $25,000,

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,610
and dividing it by the total value of the portfolio, which

33
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,050
is $75,000.

34
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,160
This gives us one third or 0.33.

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,160
We're doing exactly the same for the second ETF,

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,150
for the short term Treasury ETF, so the $35,000,

37
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,100
this is assets on that or the value

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,340
of this ETF in this portfolio, divided by the total value

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,380
$75,000, this gives us 0.47.

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,510
And finally, for the emerging markets ETF,

41
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,450
15,000 divided by 75,000 gives us 0.2.

42
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,650
Now these are the weights.

43
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,275
So this is the answer to this question.

44
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:36,420
So the weight of SPY is 0.33, the weight

45
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,810
of short term ETF in this portfolio is 0.47,

46
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,370
and the weight of IEMG is 0.2.

47
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,550
Now let's verify, so this is going to be trivial

48
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,080
but let's still verify that the weights in this portfolio

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,670
add up to 1.

50
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,710
Remember that this is a definition of the portfolio.

51
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,550
So a portfolio is a collection of securities such

52
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,460
that the weights of each individual security

53
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,580
in the portfolio should add up to 1.

54
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,340
If they don't, then this is not a portfolio by definition.

55
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,330
So here, just to verify, so 0.33, plus 0.47, plus 0.2,

56
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,700
this gives us exactly, exactly 1.

57
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,950
Again, in this particular case, this is trivial,

58
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,890
but this just re-emphasizes the definition

59
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,080
of what portfolio actually is.

60
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,860
Let's repeat the same process for client Q

61
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,950
or for portfolio Q. So the total value of this portfolio

62
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,010
is the sum of the value of individual ETFs,

63
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,680
so this is $70,000.

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,780
To compute the weight of SPY we are

65
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,610
taking the value of SPY, 10,000, dividing it by 70,000.

66
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,840
That's the total value of the portfolio,

67
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,350
so that gives us 0.14.

68
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,780
We're doing the same for short term Treasury ETF,

69
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,360
so 10,000 divided by 70,000 also 0.14.

70
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,700
The weights of the emerging market ETF

71
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,370
is 30,000, its value divided by 70,000, that's 0.43.

72
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,680
And finally, the weight of the mortgage

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,730
backed securities ETF, 20,000 divided by 70,000, that's 0.29.

74
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,100
So these are the weights of each of these four

75
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,399
assets in the portfolio of this client Q.

76
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,680
Again, just to check to make sure that all of the weights

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,280
add up to 1, we can add them all up.

78
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
And just to verify that they all add up to 1

79
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,520
and this indeed is the portfolio so

80
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,460
that we haven't made a mistake computing any of the weights

81
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,010
here.
