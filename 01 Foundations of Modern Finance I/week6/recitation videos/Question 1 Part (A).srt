00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:02,760
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will practice the concept

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,730
of expected utility.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,470
Let's start with a very simple example.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,240
We have the following investor with utility function

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,120
square root of x.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,880
And this investor is offered the following two choices,

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,830
receive $1,000 with probability 1,

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,010
or participate in the following lottery,

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,910
lottery A, which with probability 1/2 pays $1,100,

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,700
and with the remaining probability, 1/2, pays $900.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,680
So the question is, this investor,

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,650
with this utility function, which of the following two

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,070
choices she prefers.

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,500
What I have done here is, I've written

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,350
expected utility of this investor for this lottery

16
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,190
and for this sure payoff.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,470
Let's start with the lottery.

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,510
The expected utility of this investor

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,910
equals to 1/2 the utility of the payment in the first outcome,

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:13,290
which is $1,100, plus another 1/2 times the utility of $900.

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,060
This is the second outcome.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,420
So this is the utility from these payoffs weighted

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,150
by the probability of these two outcomes.

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,090
So our utility function is just the square root function.

25
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,040
So this first part becomes 1/2 multiplied

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,380
by square root of $1,100.

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,110
The second part becomes 1/2 multiplied

28
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,210
by the square root of $900.

29
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,830
So if we compute this, I get $31.58.

30
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,740
Now, in this first choice, which is the short payoff of $1,000,

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,080
the expected utility is just the utility of this $1,000,

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,800
because this is a certain outcome.

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,350
Which equals to-- again, given our utility function,

34
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,860
this equals to the square root of $1,000.

35
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,670
And this equals to $31.62.

36
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,840
Now, which of the two these investor picks?

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,479
Well let's figure out which of the two options

38
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,630
gives us higher expected utility.

39
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,200
The expected utility of the first option is $31.62.

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,160
The expected utility of the second option is $31.58.

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,240
Since $31.62 is greater than $31.58,

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,690
this investor should go for this first choice,

43
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,270
which is the certain outcome.

44
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,130
Now, the reason for this choice here

45
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,500
is that we're dealing with a risk averse investor.

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,270
If we compare the expected payoff

47
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,450
of the first option and the second option,

48
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,353
they are the same.

49
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:43,020
The expected payoff for the first option

50
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,720
is just literally $1,000.

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,950
The expected payoff of the second option is also $1,000.

52
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,390
It's 1/2 times the first pay of $1,100 plus the other 1/2 times

53
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,040
$900.

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,490
This is the payoff in the second state of the world.

55
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,140
So the average of the two is just $1,000.

56
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,850
So the expected pay of the first option

57
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,380
is exactly the same as the expected

58
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,760
pay of the second option but there is more uncertainty

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,973
of the second option.

60
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,390
And since we're dealing with the risk-averse investor, who

61
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,320
has a concave utility function, this investor

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,620
goes for a certain outcome with exactly

63
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,640
the same expected payoff as less certain outcomes

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,120
with the same expected payoff.
