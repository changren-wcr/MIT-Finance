1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,610
Let's find certainty equivalent for the second investor.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,420
Recall that her utility function is square root of x,

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,230
or x raised to the power 1/2.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,410
Let's do the same two steps as we have done

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,990
in part a of this question.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,430
So step 1, we'll find the expected utility

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,190
of this lottery for this investor.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,530
We're starting with exactly the same equation.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,780
The only difference right now is that utility function

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,549
is different.

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,810
So therefore, where we had 80,000 before,

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,150
it's going to be 80,000 raised to the power of 1/2.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,790
So the full expression looks like this,

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,230
0.1 multiplied by 80,000 raise to the power of 1/2

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,330
plus 0.3 multiplied by 20,000 raised to the power 1/2

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:58,600
plus 0.6 multiplied by 5,000 raised to the power of 1/2.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,700
So computing this gives us expected utility

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:10,900
that this investor will get from this lottery of 113.14.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,530
Now, in the second step, we can find certainty equivalent.

20
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,090
So u of CE equals to 113.14.

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,260
Now, for this investor, u of CE equals

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,370
to CE raised to the power 1/2.

23
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,070
And so now we have to solve the following equation.

24
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,100
So CE raised to the power of 1/2 equals to 113.14.

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,730
This is a simple equation to solve.

26
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,720
So this gives us CE equals to 113.14 raised to the power 2.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,330
Computing this gives us 12,800.

28
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,770
So therefore, this investor is indifferent between taking

29
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,020
$12,800 and playing this lottery.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,920
So in other words, her certainty equivalent,

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,280
or the riskless amount that she's

32
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,030
willing to trade instead of playing this lottery,

33
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,390
is $12,800.

34
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,000
