00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,430
PROFESSOR: Next, we are going to introduce

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,650
a special class of preferences called

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,990
the mean-variance preferences.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,830
These preferences are very important.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,820
They are at the core of the modern portfolio theory.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,660
They're highly tractable.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,320
And we are going to base a large part

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,090
of our discussion of portfolio choice

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,560
on this model of preferences.

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,380
Let's assume that returns on all investments

11
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,480
are normally distributed.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,520
This means that for any investment

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,190
we are willing to consider, the distribution of the returns

14
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,550
is Gaussian with the investment-specific mean

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,960
and variance.

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,720
Let's call them r bar and sigma squared

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,390
for a particular investment under consideration.

18
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,960
An investor, following the expected utility model,

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,790
is going to rank investments based

20
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,950
on their expected utility.

21
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,640
Let's compute expected utility of a normally distributed

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,500
return.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,830
It's going to be a function of the two moments--

24
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,850
the mean and the variance.

25
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,010
As a result, this investor is going

26
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,540
to evaluate each investment using only these two moments--

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,320
the average return, the mean of the investment return,

28
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,740
and the second moment, the variance of the return.

29
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,770
Hence, the name mean-variance preferences.

30
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,570
Variance of returns, or standard deviation,

31
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,720
which is the square root, is the only measure

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,685
of risk under this model.

33
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,310
And an investor compares all investments

34
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,740
based on their two key properties, the first two

35
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,070
moments.

36
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,930
We should note that this model of preferences is special.

37
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,120
It applies to many situations.

38
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,050
It produces useful results, but it's not the complete story.

39
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,970
It is, however, an important starting point.

40
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,700
And it is very widely used.

41
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,430
Now, the graph that you see helps

42
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,700
us visualize investor preferences

43
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,860
by plotting the indifference curves in the space of risk

44
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,870
and expected return.

45
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,420
In this case, we will think of risk

46
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,150
as the standard deviation of returns, which is

47
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,140
plotted on the horizontal axis.

48
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,449
And expected returns are on the vertical axis.

49
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,390
The curves that you see, the blues curves,

50
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,820
represent indifference curves corresponding

51
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,880
to a particular set of mean-variance preferences.

52
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,340
What this means is that the investor that you're

53
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,190
thinking about is indifferent between any two

54
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,700
points on the same curve.

55
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,700
Moving in the vertical direction means

56
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,370
increasing the expected return.

57
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,980
Moves us from one indifference curve to the next

58
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,210
and to the next.

59
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,190
So moving up is going to lead to higher

60
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,890
levels of expected utility.

61
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,670
Moving to the left means reducing risk.

62
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,340
This, again, leads to higher levels of expected utility.

63
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,560
When evaluating investment decisions,

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
an investor with mean-variance preferences

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,590
will prefer investments that are represented

66
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,020
by points as far as possible in the Northwest direction based

67
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,890
on the shape of the indifference curves.
