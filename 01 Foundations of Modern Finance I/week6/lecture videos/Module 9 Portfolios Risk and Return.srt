1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,810
PROFESSOR: We will now talk about risk and return

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,580
in portfolio investments.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,310
In particular, we will introduce the core concept

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,170
of this lecture, diversification.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,300
When forming your portfolio, why not

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,810
pick the best asset among many possible investments?

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,520
There are many problems with this idea.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,630
One is, of course, it's hard to tell which stock is the best.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,520
It is also the case that by forming

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,710
a portfolio of multiple investments,

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,690
one can achieve a better risk return trade off

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,130
than by picking one asset over another.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,145
That is the benefit of diversification,

14
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:40,520
something we are going to discuss

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,650
in detail in this segment.

16
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,680
One can use a portfolio to enhance performance

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,170
by focusing one's bets.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,180
This could be achieved by hedging.

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,220
For example, suppose that you have

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,100
a view on a particular company.

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,520
Your view is on the quality of firms management

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,550
or on its opportunities in the marketplace.

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,550
If you want to place a bet on a company,

24
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,680
you are, in fact, betting on much more

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,830
than your initial view.

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,940
You are betting on broad market moves

27
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,810
to which the stock is exposed.

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,930
By taking additional positions, for example,

29
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,510
by taking a short position in the market,

30
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,910
you will be able to isolate your bet.

31
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,760
So that you are betting on stock specific performance

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,180
rather than on that plus additional movements

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,040
in the market.

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,830
So forming portfolios could be very useful

35
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,250
in order to isolate views on particular elements

36
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,580
of the trade.

37
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,610
Portfolios can be used to customize and manage risks.

38
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,760
This is an important part of the risk management process.

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,970
They could be used to tailor a risk return trade off

40
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,240
to the needs of the particular investor.

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,000
How do we go about choosing the best portfolio?

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now, first of all, we have to say, what is the best mean?

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,690
This is subjective.

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,650
What we want to do is to find the portfolio that

45
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,229
is the best for a particular investor given

46
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,910
his or her preferences.

47
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,840
This process is an optimization process

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,610
among all possible portfolios.

49
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,110
We are going to look at the one that

50
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,450
maximizes the investor's objective,

51
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,410
such as expected utility.

52
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,360
This means that before we form a portfolio,

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,150
we need to agree on what the objective is.

54
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,200
What are we trying to optimize?

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,810
Which properties of the portfolio are important?

56
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,960
Now, in the mean variance framework,

57
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,670
there are two aspects of the portfolio that matter.

58
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,180
One is the expected return.

59
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,360
Investors prefer higher expected returns.

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,880
The other important dimension is risk.

61
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,330
Investors prefer lower risk, and in particular, risk

62
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,660
is measured by variance of portfolio returns.

63
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,390
Expected return on the portfolio, as well as

64
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,520
the variance of returns, are determined

65
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,070
by the composition of the portfolio, which

66
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,375
is the collection of weights on individual investments

67
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,500
and by the properties of the individual investments

68
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,300
themselves.

69
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,210
In particular, when we think about the portfolio average

70
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,600
return, portfolio mean return, it

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,840
is based on the average returns of individual assets

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,510
and portfolio weights.

73
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,360
If we have put together expected returns

74
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,530
on individual investments into a vector from one to N,

75
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,540
call each of the elements R bar, which

76
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,850
represents the expected return on each

77
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,010
of the stocks in the portfolio.

78
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,840
Then the expected return on the portfolio

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,290
is a sum over all of the positions of the expected

80
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,830
return on an individual asset times the portfolio

81
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,760
weight of that asset.

82
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,840
In other words, the expected return on the portfolio

83
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,330
is a weighted average of the individual expected returns.

84
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,840
For portfolio variance, it's a bit more involved.

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,520
First, let's summarize the information

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,610
about the properties of the individual investments.

87
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,320
This is no longer a vector, but a matrix.

88
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,530
It's the co-variance matrix.

89
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,780
The diagonal elements of this matrix

90
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,880
summarize riskiness of individual securities.

91
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,649
They are given by the variance of security returns.

92
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,320
The off diagonal elements, which will turn out

93
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,220
to be very important when we talk about diversification

94
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,580
capture co-movements of investments with each other.

95
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,670
They capture co-variance, pair-wise co-variance

96
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,670
of assets in the portfolio.

97
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,730
As an example, let's consider a portfolio of two assets.

98
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,660
One is a ETF SPY.

99
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,040
It's an equity ETF.

100
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,170
The other is a bond ETF.

101
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,460
We have seen these two securities before.

102
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,940
In the following two tables, you could see historical estimates

103
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,280
of average returns on the two securities,

104
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,610
as well as their variance co-variance matrix.

105
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,890
The variance co-variance matrix is not easy to read.

106
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,520
It is more intuitive to present information

107
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,880
as volatilities of individual investments,

108
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,530
as well as their relations with each other.

109
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,680
As we have seen before, investment in SPY

110
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,090
has much higher volatility than the bond ETF investment,

111
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,400
and correlation between these two securities

112
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,950
is very close to zero.

113
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,140
Now, let's take a close look at the expected return

114
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,490
on the portfolio.

115
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,850
As we said before, they expected return on the portfolio

116
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,920
is a weighted average of expected

117
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,530
returns on the securities in the portfolio.

118
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,780
Let's see why that is the case.

119
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,260
We will do that by following a simple example.

120
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,410
Again, two securities, SPY and AGG.

121
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:50,050
Suppose that we invest $600 into the equity ETF and $400

122
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,540
into the bond ETF.

123
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,230
It's $1,000 investment in total, and the portfolio weights

124
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:02,430
are 0.6 on SPY and 0.4 on AGG respectively.

125
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,000
Suppose that over the next month, the return on SPY

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,270
happens to be 2% and a return on the bond ETF AGG is minus 1%.

127
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,000
Keep in mind that these are realized returns

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,710
over a particular month.

129
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,550
These are not expected values.

130
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,240
What is the total return on the portfolio?

131
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,490
We can see that the portfolio value is going to change,

132
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,190
and the change is going to be equal to the sum of changes

133
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,160
in the values of the individual positions.

134
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,510
The investment in SPY is going to increase by 2%, which

135
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,220
is going to be equal to $12.

136
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,910
The investment in AGG is going to decline

137
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,060
by 1%, which is a $4 decline.

138
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,690
The total increase is $8 over 1,000,

139
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:55,080
which gives us 0.8% return on the entire portfolio.

140
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,200
What this illustrates is that the return on the portfolio

141
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,870
is equal to the weighted average of returns

142
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,850
on the individual positions.

143
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,920
Once we know how the return on the portfolio

144
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,830
is related to the returns on the individual investments,

145
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,950
we can compute the expected portfolio return

146
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,970
and the variance of the return.

147
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,600
The expected portfolio return is an expected value

148
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,750
of the weighted average of individual asset returns, which

149
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,500
ends up being the weighted average of expected returns

150
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,760
on the investments in the portfolio.

151
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,340
The unexpected component of the return

152
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,580
can be computed by subtracting the portfolio return mean

153
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,610
from the realized return.

154
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,610
Portfolio return variance is the variance

155
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,290
of the weighted average of the individual security returns.

156
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,420
Using the formula for the variance,

157
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,330
we see that this amounts to summing up

158
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,170
elements of the matrix that you see presented here,

159
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,450
where the diagonal elements of the matrix

160
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,400
are individual variances multiplied

161
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,170
by the squares of security weights in the portfolio.

162
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,470
And the off diagonal elements are co-variances

163
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,010
of asset returns multiplied by the product

164
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,140
of the corresponding weights.

165
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,150
In case of two assets in the portfolio,

166
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,170
we end up with three terms, two diagonal terms, which

167
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,860
capture the contribution of individual return variances,

168
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,320
and the off diagonal terms, which

169
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,620
are identical to each other and capture the contribution

170
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,860
of the co-movement between the two assets in the portfolio.

171
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,100
Going back to our original example of a two asset

172
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,460
portfolio of SPY and AGG, let's assume

173
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,380
that the weights on the two securities

174
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,900
are equal to each other, W1 equal to W2 equal to 1/2.

175
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,880
In this case, the expected portfolio return

176
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,080
is an arithmetic average of the expected returns on the two

177
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,275
securities.

178
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:55,250
A portfolio mean is always a weighted average

179
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,280
of individual return means.

180
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,820
Next, we compute the volatility of portfolio returns.

181
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,310
For our portfolio of SPY and AGG,

182
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,610
we find that the portfolio volatility is, in fact, less

183
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,580
than the weighted average of the individual volatilities

184
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,140
of returns.

185
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,920
This is an example of portfolio diversification.

186
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Volatility of the portfolio is not a simple weighted average

187
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,280
of individual volatilities, and by combining securities

188
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,360
together, one can achieve a significant reduction in risk.

189
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,930
What enables us to do that is the imperfect

190
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,260
correlation between returns and the individual positions

191
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,120
in the portfolio.

192
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,630
We now extend our results to the general case,

193
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,010
a portfolio of M assets.

194
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,070
This is analogous to the two assets portfolio.

195
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,480
Except now, we have a longer sum of terms,

196
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,990
and the expressions are general.

197
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,080
The portfolio return as before is a weighted average

198
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,660
of individual asset returns.

199
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,540
The portfolio mean is a weighted average

200
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,220
of mean returns on individual assets in the portfolio,

201
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,060
and the variance of the portfolio return is a sum.

202
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,180
It's a double sum over all assets in the portfolio,

203
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,450
and each element of the sum is given

204
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,930
by the product of security weights, WI and WJ for assets I

205
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,410
and J, times the co-variance between their returns.

206
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,470
If you look closely at the portfolio variance,

207
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,370
we see that it can be decomposed into two types of terms.

208
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,010
The diagonal terms capture the contribution

209
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,190
of their own variance of each of the positions,

210
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,650
and the off diagonal terms that are driven by co-variances.
