00:00:00,932 --> 00:00:05,150
PROFESSOR: We will now introduce our main result, portfolio

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,770
diversification.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,100
First, let's look at an example before we take a deeper dive

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,870
into the analytics.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,210
Consider a portfolio of two securities.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,750
This time we are going to look at two individual stocks, IBM

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,280
and Intel.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,210
These are both large technology stocks.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,340
We form a portfolio with equal investments

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,690
in these two securities.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,010
When we compare the volatilities of individual investments

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,130
on IBM and Intel to that of the portfolio,

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,370
we see that the volatility of portfolio returns

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,040
is lower than either of the two volatilities.

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,700
By combining these two securities

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,450
into a single portfolio, we are able to reduce risk.

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,520
It is now lower than it would have

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,110
been for any one of these two as individual investments.

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,240
This is an example of all one can

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,840
achieve by diversifying risk.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,990
It is intuitive why the risk of the portfolio

22
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,330
may be relatively low.

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,230
These two stocks, IBM and Intel, are different companies

24
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,290
with their own firm-specific risks.

25
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,675
They have a lot in common.

26
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:18,800
They are both technology stocks.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,100
They're both exposed to macroeconomic news.

28
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,980
But they also have individual components.

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,230
By combining them into the portfolio,

30
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,860
we are able to reduce the impact of individual firm-specific

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,850
risk.

32
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,670
When one of these stocks is up for idiosyncratic reasons,

33
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,490
the other one may be down.

34
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,200
This kind of consolidation is what

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,230
enables us to reduce the portfolio risk.

36
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,640
More formally, we will see that a reduction in portfolio risk

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,270
is based on the covariance of returns between the two assets.

38
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,370
The following graph illustrates the concept of diversification.

39
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,660
We start with two securities with identical volatilities,

40
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,900
35% in this case.

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,870
We make several alternative assumptions

42
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,139
about the degree of correlation between the two assets.

43
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,449
One extreme case will be when the correlation

44
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,590
is perfect, equal to 1.

45
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,840
Most of the time correlation is imperfect,

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,610
so we look at a few alternative values, 0.5, 0,

47
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,950
and even a negative number, minus 0.5.

48
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,130
What we see is that as the correlation between the two

49
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,450
securities declines, the volatility of the portfolio

50
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,610
gets progressively lower.

51
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,150
This illustrates the power of diversification.

52
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,970
The case of the negative correlation of 0.5

53
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,700
leads to the largest reduction in risk

54
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,310
through diversification.

55
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,230
Now, let's step back and think a bit

56
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,980
about the limits of diversification as a tool.

57
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,310
What can we hope to achieve?

58
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,360
Some of the risks are truly security specific.

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,980
And by combining assets into a portfolio,

60
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,360
we can hope to reduce the impact of these risks significantly.

61
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,420
There are certain kinds of risks that are broad,

62
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,230
that affect multiple assets or perhaps the entire market.

63
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,110
These types of risks cannot be eliminated through

64
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,590
diversification.

65
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,560
As a result, there are two types of risks that we can

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,253
distinguish, diversifiable--

67
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:23,670
these are the types of shocks that

68
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,940
can be eliminated or significantly reduced

69
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,600
through diversification by forming portfolios--

70
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,510
and non-diversifiable-- these types of risks

71
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,790
survive portfolio formation.

72
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,790
They are present even in well diversified portfolios

73
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,880
with many assets.

74
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,980
There are several intuitive examples

75
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,310
of important non-diversifiable risks,

76
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,710
for example, business cycle shocks.

77
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,070
They affect multiple businesses in the same direction.

78
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,590
As a result, forming a portfolio of stocks

79
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,020
does not help eliminate exposures

80
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,440
to business cycle shocks.

81
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,930
Inflation shocks are another example.

82
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,750
They affect multiple assets in the same direction.

83
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,590
A spike in inflation is going to affect a portfolio

84
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,370
in the same way it affects individual assets.

85
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,820
Shocks to market liquidity have a similar effect.

86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,790
Many securities decline in value when

87
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,130
market liquidity deteriorates.

88
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,540
Not all of them do.

89
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,850
As we will see in other classes, there

90
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,510
are exceptions to this rule.

91
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,060
And securities like US Treasuries

92
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,440
tend to move in the opposite direction.

93
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,870
What this tells us is that exposure to the common shocks

94
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,800
largely affects financial assets in the same way.

95
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,210
But not all of them have identical exposures.

96
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,720
It's a relatively nuanced picture.

97
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,520
Nonetheless, it is clear that shocks

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,790
like liquidity shocks, inflation shocks, and business cycle

99
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,110
shocks are different in nature from firm-specific risks, which

100
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,830
can be eliminated or reduced by diversification.

101
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,060
Let's take a closer look at the mechanics of diversification.

102
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,560
How does it work?

103
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,240
And what are the limits to what we could

104
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,820
achieve through this process?

105
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,370
Consider an equally-weighted portfolio of n securities.

106
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,260
The covariance matrix of returns has diagonal elements

107
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,270
denoted by sigma ii--

108
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,780
these are the individual variances of asset returns--

109
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,840
and off-diagonal elements, sigma ij,

110
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,730
which give us covariances of returns,

111
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,140
asset i versus asset j.

112
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,080
To compute the variance of the portfolio return,

113
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,480
we need to sum over all of the elements

114
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,580
in the covariance matrix multiplied

115
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,920
by the product of portfolio weights.

116
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,930
In our special case of the equally-weighted portfolio,

117
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,600
all portfolio weights are the same.

118
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,680
They're equal to 1 over n.

119
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,290
What we see as a result is that the variance

120
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,730
of portfolio returns is a sum of the diagonal terms.

121
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,400
Each of them is equal to 1 over n

122
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,770
squared times the variance of asset i's return

123
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,890
and the sum of the off-diagonal elements, which

124
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,930
is the sum of 1 over n squared times sigma ij over all values

125
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,260
of i and j that are not equal to each other.

126
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,650
The key observation here is that in a large matrix,

127
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,850
in a portfolio with many assets, there

128
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,190
are a lot more off-diagonal elements than there

129
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,190
are the diagonal elements.

130
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,120
In fact, in case of n assets in the portfolio,

131
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,630
there are n squared minus n off-diagonal elements.

132
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,020
To put it into perspective, in a portfolio of 100 assets,

133
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,510
there are only 100 diagonal elements.

134
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,410
And there are almost 10,000 off-diagonal elements--

135
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,950
9,900 to be precise.

136
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,110
When we put together all of the terms

137
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,840
in the expression for the portfolio variance,

138
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,480
we can see that the expression separates into two terms.

139
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,090
The first is 1 over n times the average variance

140
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,280
of individual returns.

141
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,490
The second term is very close to the average pair-wise

142
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,210
covariance of returns.

143
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,150
As the number of assets in the portfolio increases,

144
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,480
the first term converges towards 0.

145
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,240
The second term does not disappear.

146
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,490
In fact, it converges to the average covariance of returns.

147
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,540
What this result tells us is that in a well-diversified

148
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,010
portfolio with many assets, variance of portfolio returns

149
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,650
is determined by the average covariance

150
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,840
of individual returns rather than

151
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,470
by their own risk or their own variance.

152
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,700
This tells us where the limit of the diversification is.

153
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,180
By forming a large portfolio with many assets

154
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,400
and diversifying risk, we will be

155
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,880
able to eliminate firm-specific risk, asset-specific risk.

156
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,350
And we will be left with the average covariance, which

157
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,580
captures the contribution of systematic risks, those that

158
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,135
are common to multiple assets.

159
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:03,700


160
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,650
To gain further intuition, let's plug

161
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,460
in some numbers that are typical for empirical distributions

162
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,360
of asset returns.

163
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,360
On average, a standard deviation of a stock in the US stock

164
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,280
market is close to 10% per month.

165
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,510
A typical number for pair-wise correlations is 40%.

166
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,340
Using our previous expression, we

167
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,010
can then compute the average covariance

168
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,070
of returns in the portfolio.

169
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,280
The covariance is a product of the correlation coefficient

170
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,220
and individual return volatilities.

171
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,659
In our case, this product is equal to 0.004.

172
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:47,800
That is the average covariance of returns in the portfolio.

173
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,790
As we have shown, the variance of a well-diversified portfolio

174
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,030
is equal to this number, the average covariance of returns,

175
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,860
which tells us that portfolio volatility is close to 6%.

176
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,250


177
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,300
We can see that by starting with individual assets

178
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,890
with 10% return volatility and diversifying,

179
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,640
we are able to eliminate some of the risk.

180
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,230
We reduce portfolio risk to close to 6%.

181
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,220
We're not able to reduce it to 0, because some of the risk

182
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,200
is common to multiple assets.

183
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,050
But we are able to eliminate a significant fraction of risk

184
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,830
from the portfolio.

185
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,900
What if correlation was different?

186
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,050
What if it was equal to 1 or 0?

187
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,270
In this case, you would find different limits

188
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,440
to diversification.

189
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,830
As you can see from the graph, in the case

190
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,350
of perfect correlation, or equal to 1,

191
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,770
diversification does not reduce portfolio risk.

192
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,480
This is very intuitive.

193
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,500
Correlation equal to 1 means that all assets move together

194
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,880
in unison.

195
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,150
There is no benefit in combining them into a portfolio.

196
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,460
We cannot reduce the risk.

197
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,660
Correlation equal to 0 gives us more room to diversify.

198
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,230
0 correlation means that the covariance of returns

199
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,020
on any pair of assets is 0.

200
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,180
And that tells us that in a limit, when

201
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,760
the number of assets goes to infinity,

202
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,060
the variance of portfolio returns will converge to 0.

203
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,570
In this case, we can eliminate all of the risk in the limit

204
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,520
as the portfolio grows in the number of assets.

205
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,880
The curve in the middle is the case that we just explored,

206
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,640
average correlation equal to 0.4.

207
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,150
You can see that in this case, some of the portfolio risk

208
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,880
can be eliminated through diversification.

209
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,650
And some of it is left.

210
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,910
Whatever is left is what we call systematic non-diversifiable

211
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,690
risk.

212
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,970
Another lesson from this graph is

213
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,320
that it doesn't take many assets to reduce risk of the portfolio

214
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,760
significantly.

215
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,860
Starting from a single investment

216
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,560
and moving to 4 or 10 or 20 assets in the portfolio,

217
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,240
we can realize most of the benefits of diversification.

218
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,450
Going past 50 or 100 assets has little additional benefit.
