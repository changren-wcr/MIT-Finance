00:00:00,247 --> 00:00:02,830
PROFESSOR: Having discussed the properties of individual asset

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,100
returns, we will now talk about the joint distribution

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,700
of returns.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,250
How can we describe interdependence

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,920
of different financial assets?

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,310
The core concept here is correlation-- correlation

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,720
of returns.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,820
It is a measure of dependence.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,650
It's a linear measure.

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,410
It's not the only possible way of describing how returns

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,790
are related to each other.

12
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,800
But it's a leading statistic that's very commonly used.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,950
We start with the covariance of returns.

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,440
A covariance is defined mathematically

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,340
as the expected value of the product of the differences

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,290
between returns on asset i and its mean and asset

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,600
j and its mean.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,850
The correlation is just the covariance

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,210
of returns, normalized by the product of standard deviations.

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,240
What this statistic captures is to what degree two assets

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,020
co-move with each other.

22
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,400
When correlation is high, close to 1,

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,408
both assets tend to go up and down in unison.

24
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:08,950
When correlation is close to minus 1,

25
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,530
they tend to move in the opposite direction

26
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,830
from each other.

27
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,940
When correlation is zero, there is no linear relation

28
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,460
between the two assets at all.

29
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,740
A closely related concept is the beta of returns.

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,670
The beta is the ratio of the covariance between returns

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,730
on asset i and asset j and the variance of returns on asset j.

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,900
The concept of beta is very important.

33
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,810
We are going to come back to it.

34
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,930
But intuitively, what the beta represents

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,760
is the degree to which returns on asset j

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,100
affect statistically returns on asset i.

37
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,960
When beta is equal to 1, for each 1% movement in asset j,

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,130
we would see on average 1% movement in asset i.

39
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,860
When we plot returns on one asset

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,740
versus the other as a scatter plot,

41
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,920
beta is given by the slope of the regression line.

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,960
The following graph provides a visual illustration

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,740
of how joint distributions may look with positive, negative,

44
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,110
or zero correlation.

45
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,530
What you see in the top left corner

46
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,200
is a scatter plot of the joint distribution

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,320
of returns on two assets with zero correlation.

48
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,850
It looks like a ball of points.

49
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,700
There is no obvious linear relation between the two.

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,100
On the right, we see two examples

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,610
of imperfect correlation, a positive and negative.

52
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,190
At the top, correlation is positive.

53
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,900
It's equal to 0.5.

54
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,690
We see, visually, a clear positive relation between two

55
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,130
assets, which is not perfect.

56
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,390
There is a lot of deviation from the 45 degree line.

57
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,050
But nonetheless, it's clear the two assets, on average,

58
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,330
move together in a positive direction.

59
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,180
Below that is a graph corresponding

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,820
to the correlation of minus 0.5.

61
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,850
Now, we see that the typical relation between the two assets

62
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,050
is negative.

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,550
When one of them goes up, the other one tends to decline.

64
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,010
At the bottom on the left, we see an example

65
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,560
with a high degree of positive correlation.

66
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,630
Now it is 0.8.

67
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,440
We see that the points now fall very close to the 45 degree

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,250
line, indicating that most of the movement

69
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,340
is now highly related between the two assets.

70
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,070
There is very little individual variation.

71
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,770
Next, let's look at a couple of empirical examples

72
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,540
showing us the degree of correlation

73
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,560
between different kinds of financial assets.

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,110
On the left, we have a scatter plot

75
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,790
illustrating the joint distribution

76
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,310
of returns on two stocks.

77
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,750
One is Intel.

78
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,640
The other one is IBM.

79
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,790
Both of these are large technology stocks.

80
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,630
What we see from this graph is a clear sense

81
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,640
of positive relation between the two.

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,270
These two returns are positively correlated.

83
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,020
This is not surprising and, in fact, fairly typical.

84
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,410
Stocks that are economically related to each other

85
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,970
will tend to have positive correlation.

86
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,670
On the right, we see a scatter plot

87
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,040
of two exchange traded funds.

88
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,990
We encountered them earlier--

89
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,170
the bond fund, AGG, and the stock fund, SPY.

90
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,870
It's a different picture.

91
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,530
We now see that the distribution of points on the scatter plot

92
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,550
does not show an obvious linear relation.

93
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,920
The scatter plot looks like a random cloud of points.

94
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,860
And the regression line is relatively flat.

95
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,410
In this case, correlation between the two assets

96
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,630
is very close to zero.

97
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,150
Stocks and bonds have a low degree of correlation.

98
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,600
This is an important empirical fact

99
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,110
and forms the basis of long-term investment strategies

100
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,990
diversifying risk between stocks and bonds.

101
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,420
We will come back to the concept of diversification

102
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,290
later in this class.

103
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,910
Let's take a look at a broader pattern

104
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,960
of correlations among different types of financial assets.

105
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,420
In the table, we'll look at pair-wise correlations

106
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:16,130
between stocks, bonds, treasury bills, and inflation.

107
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,190
We see that closely related assets

108
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,890
tend to have high levels of correlation.

109
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,360
For instance, when we look at large cap stocks and small cap

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,470
stocks, we observe correlations around 80%.

111
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,070
Different types of equities tend to co-move with each other.

112
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,930
Corporate bonds and Treasury bonds

113
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,060
also show a high degree of co-movement, over 80%.

114
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,130
Stocks versus long-term Treasuries,

115
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,160
as we have seen before, don't have a lot of co-movement.

116
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,900
And their correlation with each other is close to zero.

117
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,960
Treasury bills tend to have positive correlation

118
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,770
with inflation.

119
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,790
It's not terribly high, but it's in the neighborhood of 40%.

120
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,480
The reason for that is that the nominal return

121
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,530
on Treasury bills has an inflation component.

122
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,270
And that induces a positive correlation between the two.

123
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,640
So far, we looked at the pair-wise correlations

124
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,180
between financial assets.

125
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,700
We think of these as cross-sectional correlations,

126
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,790
how returns are related to each other at a point in time.

127
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,260
Another important dimension is time-series correlation

128
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,680
or order correlation.

129
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,290
This concept applies to a single asset over time.

130
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,260
We are now looking at how returns

131
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,220
during different periods are related to each other.

132
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,430
The empirical fact in financial markets

133
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,240
is that there is not a lot of serial correlation in returns.

134
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
Autocorrelation, or serial correlation,

135
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,910
of returns on most assets is very close to zero.

136
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,230
This is the case for stocks and long-term bonds.

137
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,470
The reason for that has to do with the fact

138
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,960
that high degree of serial correlation

139
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,810
would imply that it is relatively easy to forecast

140
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,380
future returns by observing past returns;

141
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,420
the two are closely related.

142
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,090
Being able to predict returns in risky assets

143
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,810
would then enable one to design highly profitable trading

144
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,100
strategies.

145
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,830
These are difficult to come by.

146
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,010
As a result, the implication is that one should not

147
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,710
observe high levels of autocorrelation

148
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,660
in returns, particularly at high frequency-- daily,

149
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,690
weekly, or monthly.

150
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,120
The following figure illustrates the point.

151
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,170
We are now looking at the monthly returns on a stock.

152
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,150
It's a stock of IBM.

153
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,920
And the scatter plot shows returns

154
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,120
in any given month against returns in the previous month.

155
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,290
We see that there is no clear linear pattern on this graph.

156
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,590
And in fact, the empirical estimate of the autocorrelation

157
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,310
over this period, which starts at the beginning of '08, is

158
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,560
close to minus 6%.

159
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,750
There is not a lot of autocorrelation

160
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,990
in returns on this stock or most other risky investments.
