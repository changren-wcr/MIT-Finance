00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,030


1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,630
INSTRUCTOR: Next, we are going to develop a concept called

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,030
risk aversion, or to be more precise,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,685
relative risk aversion.

4
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:10,310
This is the key property of the utility

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,320
function, which reflects the property of investor behavior.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,140
How averse is this investor to risky outcomes?

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,410
We are going to start with the basic fundamental properties

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,450
of the utility function itself.

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,200
Some desirable properties.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,470
For example, if we want the investor to prefer more

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,430
to less, which is very common, mathematically it's

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,740
going to imply that, when confronted

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,400
with a choice between gamble x or gamble

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,360
x plus positive epsilon, the investor

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,370
is going to prefer x plus epsilon.

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,550
What it means is that to capture preferences like these,

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,890
preference for more to less, an investor

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,310
would have to have an increasing utility function.

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,530
So far, so good.

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,670
Utility function has to be increasing.

21
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,560
What more can we say about it's shape?

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,830
As it happens, if an investor is averse to risk,

23
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,860
the utility function also has to be concave.

24
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,420
Now why is that?

25
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,960
Suppose an investor is presented with a risky gamble, x.

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,700
The choice is, take the risk, play out, gamble x,

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,110
collect the outcomes.

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,340
Or receive a sure thing, a pay off without risk

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,680
equal to the expected value of x.

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,420
Between x random, expected value of x, sure thing.

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,180
What would the investor choose?

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,400
Now most investors are averse to risk.

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,970
They would rather collect a sure thing,

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,790
a fixed payoff equal to the expected value of the gamble.

35
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,640
Mathematically, it means that the utility function

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,910
has to be concave.

37
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,810
If the utility function is concave,

38
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,050
then the mean of the gamble is always

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,330
preferred to the gamble itself.

40
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,420
To illustrate the concept of risk aversion graphically,

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,500
and to see how this is related to concavity of the utility

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,180
function, look at the graph.

43
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,690
The blue line is the utility function

44
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,979
plotted against the outcome of the gamble.

45
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,690
This function is concave.

46
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,630
Now imagine that we are playing a binary gamble, as before.

47
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,900
Two outcomes, 1.2, 2.8.

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,670
Both outcomes are equally likely.

49
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,970
If the investor evaluates this gamble using

50
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,600
the expected utility model, the expected utility

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,110
is going to be seen on the graph as the dot in the middle

52
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,790
of the red segment.

53
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,230
This is the line connecting two points, utility of 1.2,

54
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,840
utility of 2.8.

55
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,355
Now this is the expected utility of the random payoff.

56
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:43,730
What if instead, the investor was

57
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,890
presented with the sure thing.

58
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,660
The expected value of the gamble.

59
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,950
In this case, the expected value is 2.

60
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,310
The utility evaluated at the expected value of the gamble

61
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,000
is shown as the blue dot on the utility curve.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,180
The blue dot, of course, is above the red dot.

63
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,880
It has to be, because, the utility function is concave.

64
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,520
This is the essence of what a concave function is.

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,880
So what we can see is that, based

66
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,290
on this graphical representation,

67
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,770
it's quite clear that concavity of the utility function

68
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,470
is equivalent to risk aversion in behavior.

69
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,520
Now we're going to develop a concept of risk premium.

70
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,120
Suppose that an investor is evaluating an investment

71
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,800
strategy with return x, which is random.

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,990
And an investor starts with wealth w,

73
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:38,050
invests, and collects a payoff equal to w times 1 plus x.

74
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,100
Let's assume that the expected return is 0.

75
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,350
And we are going to call the variance of chance sigma

76
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,380
x squared.

77
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,880
The risk averse investor, of course,

78
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,970
would prefer to receive a 0 return for sure,

79
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,300
a risk-free return of 0, rather than playing this gamble.

80
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,030
Rather than making this investment.

81
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,810
Now we are going to define the concept of risk premium

82
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,780
as a number, pi.

83
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,120
It's a fixed number, it's not a random variable.

84
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,930
Such that an investor would be indifferent between collecting

85
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,480
a return of minus pi or investing

86
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,230
into a strategy with the risk return x.

87
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,779


88
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,110
To determine what pi is, how it reflects

89
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,060
the properties of the utility function

90
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,220
and the risk of the gamble, we need

91
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,550
to think about investors' preferences.

92
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,000
Being indifferent between investing

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
into an asset with a random return

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,740
x versus getting a sure risk-free return of minus pi

95
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,440
means mathematically that expected utility

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,780
of w times 1 plus x is equal to the utility evaluated

97
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:54,490
at w times 1 minus pi, which is a riskless return of minus pi.

98
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,900
To analyze this equation further,

99
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,790
we need to make some approximations.

100
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,460
We are going to use a Taylor expansion to simplify

101
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,820
the problem.

102
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,970
So to start with, let's assume that

103
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,330
the range of outcomes of this gamble--

104
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,850
the support of the return x--

105
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,470
is relatively narrow.

106
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,020
So that the range of possible outcomes of x

107
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,540
is concentrated somewhere around 0.

108
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,760
Let's say between minus and plus epsilon where

109
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,510
epsilon is a small number.

110
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,160
If that is the case, then there is premium,

111
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,090
pi, is going to be small in magnitude as well,

112
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,430
which allows us to use a Taylor expansion

113
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,130
to approximate the problem.

114
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,630
With this idea in mind, we're going

115
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,000
to expand both sides of the equation around 0.

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,900
Let's start with the left-hand side.

117
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,560
Expected utility of w times 1 plus x.

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,820
We are going to expand it around x equal to 0.

119
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,960
First, let's expand the utility function under the expectation.

120
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,410
We are going to keep three leading terms in the expansion.

121
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,120
First, utility of w.

122
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,090
Then the margin utility, u prime,

123
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,840
evaluated to w times w times x.

124
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,870
That's the linear term in the Taylor expansion.

125
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,660
Then comes the second order, a quadratic term.

126
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,840
1/2 of the second derivative of u times w

127
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,420
squared times x squared.

128
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,780
When we take the expected value of this expression,

129
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,330
we are left with utility of w u prime times w times

130
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,440
the expected value of x, which by assumption is 0, plus--

131
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,240
and here is the important term--

132
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,360
1/2 of the second derivative of u,

133
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,720
times w squared times the variance of the return,

134
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,090
which is sigma x squared.

135
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,190
This is the approximation of the left-hand side.

136
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,740
The expected utility of the risk to return.

137
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,140
On the right-hand side, we have the utility

138
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,590
of w times 1 minus pi, which we also expand.

139
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,910
Here, we only need to keep the two leading terms, 0 order

140
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,580
and the first order.

141
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:04,660
We end up with u of w minus u prime times w times pi.

142
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,340
We end up with inequality.

143
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,400
On the left-hand side, we have an approximate expression

144
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,850
for the expected utility of the risky investment.

145
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,870
On the right-hand side, it's the utility of w times 1 minus pi,

146
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,010
the certainty equivalent, which defines the risk premium.

147
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,420
When we solve this equation, we see that the risk premium

148
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:29,090
is given by minus 1/2 times the ratio of the second derivative

149
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,790
of the utility function times w divided by u prime of w

150
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,760
times sigma x squared.

151
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,390
We see that the risk premium is a product of two objects.

152
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,360
The first is what we call relative risk aversion

153
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,560
coefficient.

154
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,940
This is minus w times the second derivative

155
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,280
of the utility function divided by the first derivative.

156
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,620
This object captures what we know

157
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,050
is the curvature of the utility function.

158
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,670
If the utility function were to be a straight line,

159
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,610
the second derivative would be 0.

160
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,990
Relative risk aversion would be 0.

161
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,200
For a properly concave utility function,

162
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,850
this number is positive.

163
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,630
The second piece, the second term, in the risk premium

164
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,180
is the measure of return risk.

165
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,510
In this case, we see that its return variance.

166
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,880
The conclusion is that the risk premium

167
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,680
that investor demands, based on the riskiness of the gamble

168
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,780
of the investment strategy, and based

169
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,710
on his or her own preferences, is comprised of two terms.

170
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,750
Investor's relative risk aversion,

171
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,000
which is the property of the utility function,

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,870
and return variance, which is the measure of return risk.

173
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,260
Let's consider a couple of examples of utility functions.

174
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,530
First, the simplest case is a linear utility.

175
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,180
In this case, u of w is an affine function of w.

176
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,120
Linear utility is special because it implies

177
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
0 relative risk aversion.

178
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,330
An investor with linear utility does not care about risk.

179
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,090
This kind of investor is going to evaluate each investment

180
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,380
opportunity based on the expected value of the return.

181
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,330
The second example of the utility function

182
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,480
that we want to introduce is the so-called power utility

183
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,770
function.

184
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,560
It's also called constant relative risk aversion.

185
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,680
We will see in a second why this name.

186
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,710
A power utility function is given by a power function

187
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,270
of investor's wealth.

188
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,660
And its coefficient is a positive number.

189
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,870
The case of the coefficient equal to 1 is special.

190
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,620
In this case, the utility function becomes logarithmic.

191
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,880
The key property of the power utility function,

192
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,180
and the reason why it's so commonly used,

193
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,710
is that the relative risk aversion

194
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,430
coefficient of this utility function is constant.

195
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,560
It's equal to the exponent in the power,

196
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,440
and it's independent of the level of wealth.

197
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,400
The implication of this is that an investor following a power

198
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,730
utility function is going to have the same risk

199
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,610
aversion, regardless of the level of wealth.

200
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,680
Which means that making an investment decision

201
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,090
with a million dollars or 5 or 10,

202
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,450
this investor is going to choose the same portfolio

203
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,620
of investments.

204
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,750
The level of initial wealth doesn't effect the choice.
