00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:01,620
PROFESSOR: In this class, we're going

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,730
to talk about fundamental concepts, risk and return.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,670
These are at the core of financial models

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,100
and decision-making.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,270
Managing and measuring risk is the kind of problem

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,560
that shows up in many contexts.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,040
For example, think about an investor saving for retirement.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,430
One can adopt a safer strategy providing

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,720
a higher likelihood of reaching a target, but a lower upside.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,900
Or an investor can pursue a riskier strategy--

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,450
invest more in equities, for example--

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,450
providing higher likelihood of an upside

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,990
but also a higher chance of falling short.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,050
A hedge fund needs to decide how to allocate capital

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,080
across multiple investment strategies.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,470
This depends on the risk of individual strategies, which

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,500
has to be measured and managed, as well as

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,240
the joint distribution of returns on multiple strategies.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,470
An insurance company which sells multiple types of products--

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,320
life insurance, casualty insurance--

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,070
has to decide how to model the joint distribution of risk.

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,820
How do you quantify the risk at the firm level?

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,760
Is it the case that individual insurance contracts

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,600
are roughly independent and the risk can be diversified?

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,700
Or is there a common component which

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,560
is going to translate into firm-level risk?

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,460
A sovereign wealth fund, when formulating an investment

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,960
strategy, needs to be aware of how financial risks are

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,470
related to the underlying risks of the country's economy.

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,570
All of these problems are examples of risk measurement

31
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,270
and risk management.

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,530
In order to make decisions under uncertainty,

33
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,190
we need an analytical, mathematical framework.

34
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,100
In this class, we're going to introduce the Expected Utility

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,760
Theory.

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,290
This theory quantifies decision-making and the risk

37
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:07,070
and can be used as a basis of portfolio choice in particular.

38
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,340
We are going to develop analytical tools

39
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,100
for quantifying risk, for measuring it,

40
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,370
and apply them to investment decisions.

41
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,920
This all comes under the broader umbrella

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,790
of portfolio analytics.

43
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,160
We will also introduce the concept of diversification.

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,690
Diversification is a process of eliminating risks

45
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,750
by pooling investments into a portfolio.

46
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,260
Many call diversification the only remaining free lunch

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,240
in financial markets.
