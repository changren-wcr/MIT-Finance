1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,730
PROFESSOR: We will now introduce basic elements

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,590
of portfolio analytics.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,720
In particular, we'll introduce concepts

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,170
of leverage and margin.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,760
First, let's define a portfolio.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,360
A portfolio is a collection of assets, risky or risk free.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,120
The portfolio is defined by its composition--

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,860
how many shares of each security are held in the portfolio.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,800
In terms of notation, we are going

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,130
to denote the total portfolio value by V.

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,820
And this value is going to be equal to the sum of investments

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,700
in each of the securities in the portfolio.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,800
Each of the investments is valued

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,440
as the number of shares times the market price.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,090
So the total portfolio value V is equal to the sum,

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,940
across all of the positions in the portfolio,

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,380
of the product of the price Pi and the number of shares Ni.

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,240
The composition of the portfolio can also

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,730
be described by portfolio weights.

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,370
The weight on each investment is defined

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,630
as the ratio of the value of the position, normalized

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,740
by the value of the portfolio.

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,430
It's the ratio of Ni times Pi, which

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,740
is the value of the position over V,

25
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,920
the value of the portfolio.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,580
For this definition to make sense,

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,730
the value of the portfolio cannot be 0.

28
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,880
In fact, typically, the value is positive.

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,220
There are, however, some portfolios for which

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,480
the value V could be 0.

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,810
We call these arbitrage portfolios.

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,240
An arbitrage portfolio is special.

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,130
It does not require a positive investment.

34
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,490
For every long position in the portfolio,

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,520
there has to be a short position so that the total investment

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,370
into the portfolio is 0.

37
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,470
For a typical portfolio, V is positive.

38
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,430
Portfolio weights, in this case, are well defined.

39
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,620
And by definition, they have to add up to 1.

40
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,930
So the sum of W1 plus W2 and so forth

41
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,300
across all of the positions in the portfolio

42
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,870
is always equal to 1.

43
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,510
As an example, consider a portfolio

44
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,509
of three securities, A, B, and C,

45
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,840
with a total investment of $100,000.

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,280
Suppose that we buy 200 shares of assets A,

47
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,020
1,000 shares of asset B, and 750 shares of asset C.

48
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,380
You can see the relevant data in the table.

49
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,350
You can see the number of shares in each position,

50
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,250
the price per share, which is $50 for A, $60 for B,

51
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,530
and $40 for C, and the total investment into each security.

52
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,380
The total investment is equal to the number of shares

53
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,910
times the share price.

54
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,510
For example, for asset A, it's 200 shares at $50 per share.

55
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,030
It's $10,000.

56
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,080
It's $60,000 for asset B and $30,000 for asset C.

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,100
So the total investment is $100,000.

58
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,540
You can see, in the column on the right, portfolio weights.

59
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,160
As we said before, portfolio weight

60
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,215
is defined as the ratio of the value of each position

61
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:08,130
to the total value of the portfolio.

62
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,920
For A, it's going to be 10,000 divided

63
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,450
by 100,000, which is 10%.

64
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,960
It's 60% for B and 30% for C. By definition, these weights sum

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,520
up to 1 or 100%.

66
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,590
Now, suppose your broker informs you

67
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,620
that you could, in fact, maintain the same portfolio

68
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,550
with less capital.

69
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,890
Let's say, you could reduce your capital investment

70
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,080
to $50,000 from $100,000.

71
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,730
How can you achieve that?

72
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,570
You need to use margin.

73
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,660
You could borrow money at the risk-free rate

74
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,310
to buy risky assets in the portfolio.

75
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,080
In our particular example, in order

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,500
to buy $100,000 worth of stocks starting

77
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,330
with $50,000 in capital, you would

78
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,410
need to borrow $50,000 at the risk-free rate.

79
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,170
This changes the portfolio composition.

80
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,050
If you now look at the table, you

81
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,640
see that we have a new row, which corresponds

82
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,120
to the risk-free bond.

83
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,230
The investment into the bond is negative,

84
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,670
which means that we are borrowing $50,000.

85
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,829
The investment in each of the stocks is the same as before.

86
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,860
We're establishing the same portfolio.

87
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,560
The portfolio weights, however, now change.

88
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,470
The reason is that while the investment into each

89
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,060
of the securities, A, B, and C, is the same as before,

90
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,730
the total value of the portfolio in the denominator

91
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,730
is now $50,000 and not $100,000, which

92
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,390
doubles the weight on each of the risky assets.

93
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,870
It is now 20% invested in A rather than 10%,

94
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,290
120% in B rather than 60%, and 60% in C instead of 30%.

95
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,210
When we sum up portfolio weights across the risky assets

96
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,080
plus minus 100% invested in the risk-free bond,

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,580
the total of the weights is again 100%.

98
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,390
Another example of a portfolio that is commonly used

99
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,300
can be seen in buying real estate.

100
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,110
Imagine that you're buying a house.

101
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,140
The value of the house is $500,000.

102
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,960
You make an initial investment of $100,000, which

103
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,720
is 20% of the house value.

104
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,300
These ratios are typical for the US residential market.

105
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,200
The remaining $400,000 need to be borrowed.

106
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,720
And they could be borrowed by obtaining

107
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,210
a mortgage on the home.

108
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,580
As a result, a buyer of the house

109
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,730
has a portfolio with two positions--

110
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,380
$500,000 of real estate, which is the value of the house,

111
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,980
and a negative position of $400,000, which

112
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,480
represents the mortgage.

113
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,340
This is the amount of money that the buyer owes to the bank.

114
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,570
The total net value of the investment,

115
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,100
which has developed the portfolio, V, is $100,000.

116
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,620
It's the sum of the two positions.

117
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,870
If we now compute portfolio weights,

118
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,030
we see that the weight of the house--

119
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,860
the weight of the real estate in the portfolio-- is plus 500%.

120
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,870
And the weight of the mortgage, which is a loan, is minus 400%.

121
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,370
The total, again, is 1, 100%.

122
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,060
The ratio of the asset value to the net investment

123
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,920
is what we call leverage.

124
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,900
That's the leverage ratio.

125
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,890
In our example of buying a house, the asset is the house.

126
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,710
The net investment is $100,000, which

127
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,090
is what the buyer of the home invests into this property.

128
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,030
The ratio of the asset value to the net investment

129
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,150
is 500 over 100, which is 5.

130
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,940
That's the leverage ratio of this transaction.

131
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,170
Leverage magnifies movements in the asset value.

132
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,570
It scales up gains as well as losses.

133
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,060
For example, suppose that the house value declines by 15%.

134
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,030
A cash buyer would have seen a 15% decline

135
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,970
in the total value of the portfolio.

136
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,620
Someone who uses a mortgage is going

137
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,420
to see a much larger decline.

138
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,260
In fact, it's going to be 5 times as large, 75%.

139
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,720
To see that, let's compute the decline in the asset value.

140
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,020
$500,000-- that's the value of the initial investment--

141
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,340
declines by $75,000, which is 15%.

142
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,360
Following the decline of 15%, the value of the house

143
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,130
is now $425,000.

144
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,370
With the initial investment of $100,000

145
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,560
and the mortgage of $400,000, this

146
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,020
means that the buyer of the house

147
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,590
is left with a total of $25,000.

148
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,150
That is a $75,000 decline, or a 75% decline

149
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,360
relative to the initial investment.
