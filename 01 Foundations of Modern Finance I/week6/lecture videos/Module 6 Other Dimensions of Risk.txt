00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250
PROFESSOR: We will now talk about other dimensions

1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,080
of return risk.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,010
We will try to think outside of the mean variance framework.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,650
For an investor, properties of returns other than return

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,440
variance could be important.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,530
In particular, we can think about such moments

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,370
as skewness and kurtosis.

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,080
Skewness is a property of the return distribution

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,640
that measures its asymmetry.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,130
A distribution that skew to the right

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,170
will have the property that large positive outcomes

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,900
are more likely than large negative outcomes.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,110
Similarly, if you'll think about negative skewness,

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,090
then large negative outcomes are more

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,470
likely than large positive.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,690
Skewness is particularly important

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,450
when dealing with non-linear investment instruments

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,120
such as derivatives.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,830
For investment strategies involving derivatives,

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,860
return distribution is often highly skewed

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,310
and as a result mean various preferences do not completely

21
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,560
capture all dimensions of risk that

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,010
are relevant for the investor.

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,220
Kurtosis is another feature of the distribution.

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,170
It captures the measure of heavy tails, of fat tails.

25
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,230
A distribution with a high level of kurtosis

26
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,410
has the property that extreme outcomes on the right

27
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,260
or on the left are both relatively likely.

28
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,330
In particular, they're more likely than

29
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,160
under the normal distribution.

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,380
When we think about an investment strategy

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,810
with a high degree of kurtosis, we

32
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,570
have to worry about the high likelihood

33
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,010
of these outcomes which is an important dimension of risk.

34
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,100
We also need to think about modeling risk.

35
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,100
If a distribution has fat tails, the properties of distribution,

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,070
such as the mean and the variance,

37
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,440
are relatively difficult to estimate.

38
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,165
In the following table, we compare return moments, mean,

39
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:58,540
and standard deviation of two exchange traded funds.

40
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,560
First, let me remind you what the exchange traded funds are.

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,120
These are securities that trade just like stocks,

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,449
and underneath these securities are portfolios,

43
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,410
investment strategies, that follow

44
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,040
a relatively simple recipe.

45
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,130
These are funds, they're portfolios,

46
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,960
but they trade as stocks.

47
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,300
They're very convenient and increasingly popular

48
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,500
investment vehicles.

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,920
We are looking at two types of funds in this exercise.

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,860
One is an equity fund with the ticker symbol SPY.

51
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,290
This is a fund that tracks on S&P 500 index.

52
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,260
The second fund is a bond fund, this is a bond ETF,

53
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,050
with the ticker symbol AGG and this fund

54
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,930
tracks a portfolio of bonds.

55
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,900
The average returns over the past decade or so

56
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,710
are around 0.7% for SPY and around 0.3% for AGG.

57
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,740
In the table, you could see the average returns

58
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,530
and the standard deviation of returns

59
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,250
at the monthly frequency starting in January of 2008.

60
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,260
The takeaway here is that the equity ETF, SPY, is much more

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,680
volatile than the bond ETF.

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,150
The ratio volatilities is practical a four to one.

63
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,440
Next, let's take a closer look at the distribution of returns

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,390
on one of these funds.

65
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,980
We're looking at the bond fund here.

66
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,620
As we can see from this graph, there

67
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,980
is a large outcome on the right.

68
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,890
When we evaluate the likelihood of this outcome

69
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,540
under the normal distribution with the same variance

70
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,440
as the historical distribution of returns on this ETF,

71
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,800
we find that this observation which

72
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,860
happens to come from December of 2008

73
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,250
is approximately 5.8 standard deviations away from the mean.

74
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,880
If you recall, December of '08, it was right in the middle

75
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,530
of the great financial crisis.

76
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,820
How likely is this kind of observation?

77
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,320
Under the normal distribution while

78
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,540
would have to wait on average 10 million years

79
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,010
in order to see a draw of returns like this.

80
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,010
What this analysis tells us is that the distribution

81
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,080
of returns on the bond ETF is very far from normal.

82
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,170
This is an example of high kurtosis.

83
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,630
These types of outcomes are extremely

84
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,690
rare under the normal model, yet we do see them

85
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,260
in the financial data series.

86
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,800
High kurtosis is a common feature in financial markets.

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
Properties of asset returns are not constant.

88
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,120
They change over time.

89
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,730
This is very important to recognize

90
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,120
when modeling the distribution of returns statistically.

91
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,780
It also helps us understand some of the properties of returns,

92
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,020
such as high likelihood of extreme outcomes,

93
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,470
high kurtosis relative to the normal distribution.

94
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,340
Let's take a closer look at the exchange traded fund.

95
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,340
This fund tracks a portfolio of high yield bonds.

96
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,860
The ticker symbol is HYG.

97
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,290
Again, we're looking at the time series starting in 2008.

98
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,340
What we see from the graph is a pretty clear period

99
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,160
of high volatility in the early part of the sample.

100
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,390
This is the crisis period of '08 and '09.

101
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,470
This is not surprising.

102
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,990
As we know from history, this was the period

103
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,590
of significant dislocation in financial markets, credit

104
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,240
markets in particular.

105
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,420
As a result, fixed income investment strategies

106
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,450
such as those represented by this type of fund

107
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,220
were extremely volatile.

108
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,470
During this period, there were many months

109
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:59,010
with high draws of returns, either large positive returns

110
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,600
or large negative returns.

111
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,280
To be specific, we observed five month with returns

112
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,900
exceeding three standard deviations in magnitude.

113
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,930
And that happened in a span of a single year.

114
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,790
This should be extremely unlikely

115
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,730
under the normal distribution with constant volatility.

116
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,370
Of course, the point here is that volatility is not

117
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,420
constant.

118
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,050
This early period produced so many large observations

119
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,630
of returns precisely reflecting the fact

120
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,120
that the market volatility was relatively high.

121
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,520
What this example illustrates is that it

122
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,860
is important to model time variation

123
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,660
in near-term volatility in order to have

124
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,930
a realistic model of risk.

125
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,220
Risk is time varying.
