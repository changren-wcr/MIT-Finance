1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,495
PROFESSOR: In this segment, we'll

2
00:00:01,495 --> 00:00:03,940
talk about the expected utility theory.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,030
So let's start with a basic decision problem

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,560
under uncertainty.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,350
Suppose you're choosing between two gambles, gamble

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,480
x, gamble y.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,450
Gamble x allows you to win $1,000

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,980
or to get nothing with 50/50 odds.

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,990
Gamble y gives you a 70% chance of winning $600 or 30%

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,300
chance of winning $200.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,190
Which of these choices is preferred?

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,670
Now, a naive approach would be to compute expected payoffs

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,590
and then choose the higher one.

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,850
But what about randomness?

15
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,840
What about risk?

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,650
We know that a 50/50 gamble of winning $1,000

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,150
or getting nothing is not the same as getting $500 for sure.

18
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,390
Most people are averse to this kind of risk.

19
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,850
How should we quantify the trade off

20
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,630
between expected payoffs, uncertainty, variance,

21
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,668
or other properties of the payoff distributions?

22
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:00,710
That is the question that we are going to answer.

23
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,680


24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,700
There are two general approaches to building models for decision

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,560
making and uncertainty.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,530
Let's call them rational and behavioral.

27
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,090
The rational approach, which is what

28
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,390
we are going to pursue in this class, is prescriptive.

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,370
It's a model of choice, which gives us consistent decisions

30
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,870
and uncertainty.

31
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,700
This internal consistency is desirable.

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,380
It's basically a way of avoiding costly mistakes.

33
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,960
Behavioral approach has a different objective.

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,230
Rather than figuring out what is the right consistent way

35
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,140
of making decisions, the behavioral approach

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,440
aims to describe how individuals make decisions

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,750
in all of their imperfections.

38
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,000
For example, if you're an investor,

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,840
you're trying to avoid mistakes in your portfolio choice.

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,820
You would want to use a rational approach

41
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,310
to make sure that your own decision making is consistent.

42
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,370
If you're a financial advisor thinking

43
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,770
about how to best advise your clients,

44
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,170
you may want to understand what behavioral biases are

45
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,110
most relevant and help the client correct them.

46
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,908
If you're a trader, thinking about what other traders are

47
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:11,450
doing in the market, whoever's taking

48
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,960
the other side of your trade, understanding behavioral biases

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,300
could be at the core of your profitability.

50
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,700
So we're going to proceed developing

51
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,860
a model of consistent decision making,

52
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,980
and we'll call it a rational model.

53
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,100
Our model is going to make a few basic assumptions.

54
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,820
We are going to think about preferences over outcomes only.

55
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,560
Outcomes in our case are cash flows.

56
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,390
This is important.

57
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,640
It's a restriction which could be relaxed.

58
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,830
But under the basic model, we are

59
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,600
going to make this assumption.

60
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,820
What this means is that we are going

61
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,200
to think about the value of the pay off--

62
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,860
$100, $1,000 payoff.

63
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,590
We're not going to think about the circumstances under which

64
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,150
the payoffs are realized.

65
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,080
That is a more general problem.

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,210
We will also model preferences in a way

67
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,230
that is independent of how cash flows are generated.

68
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,750
Randomness may come from many sources.

69
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,730
It could be algorithmically generated.

70
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,550
It could be a natural outcome of economic forces.

71
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,560
At the end, our preferences are going

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,190
to be developed to deal with the distribution of cash flows

73
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,360
and not with the mechanism for generating randomness.

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,860
These are the two basic assumptions

75
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,330
that we are going to start with.

76
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,570
We're going to maintain them.

77
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,670
The expected utility theory, which

78
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,510
we are going to present next, is at the core

79
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,860
of the rational approach to decision making.

80
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,740
It's the leading model for decision making

81
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,900
and uncertainty.

82
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,240
Under the expected utility theory,

83
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,880
investors do not use expected payoff

84
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,800
of a gamble to compare gambles to each other.

85
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,518
They don't think about just the mean of the return.

86
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:51,310
They don't think about the expected pay off

87
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,540
of an investment.

88
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,370
They think about the entire distribution.

89
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,120
Expected utility theory applies a transformation to the payoff.

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,290
It's a nonlinear transformation.

91
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,490
For example, $1,000 payoff is not

92
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,540
going to be perceived as twice as valuable as $500.

93
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,330
An investor, depending on his or her preferences,

94
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,880
is going to adjust the internal value

95
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,370
of each payoff, the utility of each payoff,

96
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,430
to reflect their preferences.

97
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,400
Once the payoffs are transformed nonlinearly,

98
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,710
as you can see in this graph, the probabilities of payoffs

99
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,630
are then applied as weights.

100
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,970
So under the expected utility theory,

101
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,450
an investor evaluates a particular risk investment

102
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,800
based on the expected utility, where the utility evaluated

103
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,060
as a function of outcomes is averaged using probabilities

104
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,490
of different events as weights.

105
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,790
For example, if you are faced with a binary gamble

106
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,960
and the curve presented on the graph,

107
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,630
the blue line is the utility function.

108
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,390
The gamble has only two possible payoffs, either 1.2 or 2.8,

109
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,950
both equally likely.

110
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,630
The utility of the payoff is going to be given by the dot

111
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,030
in the middle of the segment, connecting the two

112
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,400
dots on the utility curve.

113
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,230
This is a graphical representation

114
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,590
of the expected utility of this particular gamble.

115
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,950
An investor transforms payoffs using the utility function

116
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,890
and computes expected value of the utility.

117
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,270
That's the starting point.

118
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,640
That's the description of uncertainty

119
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,490
and how an investor feels about different risky outcomes.

120
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,710
Now, the consistent approach to choice

121
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,070
is to compare risky investments to each other

122
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,100
based on their expected utility.

123
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,460
When thinking about investment a versus investment b,

124
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,150
whichever yields higher expected utility is preferred.

125
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,300
That is the expected utility theory.

126
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,750
This approach is mathematicaly parsimonious.

127
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,910
It's fairly intuitive, and it helps avoid costly mistakes.

128
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,580
It respects laws of probability.

129
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,190
It leads to investment decisions with

130
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,580
some basic desirable properties, such as sensitivity.

131
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,210
For example, under the expected utility theory,

132
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,110
if an investor prefers x to y and y to z,

133
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,000
the same investor will correctly prefer x to z.
