1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,080
PROFESSOR: We have now developed a general method

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,560
to value an asset.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,419
If we are given its expected cash

4
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:10,940
flow and the right discount rate,

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,180
its value is simply given by the present value

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,180
of its expected cash flow, a simple calculation.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,190
When using this method in different applications,

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,700
we need to come up with estimates

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,840
of an asset's expected cash flow and the corresponding discount

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,940
rates.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,220
As we dive into these applications,

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,210
we will further develop the tools and techniques

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,580
needed to come up with these estimates.

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,850
For now, I would only like to mention

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,860
several general considerations to keep

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,510
in mind in actual valuation applications.

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,150
The first is taxes.

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,200
It is important to keep in mind that cash flows generated

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,070
by assets are often subject to taxes.

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,940
For example, financial assets, such as bonds and stocks,

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,350
pay in the form of interest, dividends, and capital gains.

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,240
Investors may have to pay taxes on these payments.

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Firms earn profits, but they also have to pay taxes.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,410
What then matters when it comes to valuing an asset

25
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,860
will be its cash flows after taxes.

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,140
Thus, in the present value calculation,

27
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,530
we have to use after tax cash flows.

28
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,680
We will see more of this point in later applications,

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,780
especially in project valuations.

30
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,350
The second factor to keep in mind is currency.

31
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,650
All examples so far, and throughout this course,

32
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,270
will consider cash flows denominated in US dollars.

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,220
This is only for convenience.

34
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,260
In practice, of course, cash flows

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,170
can come in other currencies.

36
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,170
Our method is perfectly applicable.

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,710
We only need to switch to cash flows and discount

38
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,890
rates denominated in these currencies.

39
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,410
The third factor to keep in mind is how to forecast cash flows.

40
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,470
When valuing an asset, we first need

41
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,610
to come up with estimates or forecasts of its future cash

42
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,510
flows--

43
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,860
magnitude, timing and risk.

44
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,350
Sometimes these forecasts are given

45
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,170
to us, such as the cash flow of a government bond, which

46
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,430
includes interests and the principal payment.

47
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,850
Often we need to come up with our own forecasts,

48
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,740
such as dividends from a stock or profits from a project.

49
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,490
We will do so when we get into these applications.

50
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,310
Given an asset's cash flow, size, timing and risk,

51
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,920
we need to find the right discount rates from the market.

52
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,000
How to do this operationally requires further development

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,780
and enrichment of our valuation methodology,

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,040
which we will spend more time on over this course.

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,300
For now, we only need to keep in mind a few points.

56
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,190
For cash flow, the discount rate will depend on its timing.

57
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,420
That is, if it's in one year, in two years, or five years.

58
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,030
In case the cash flow is risk-free,

59
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,610
we can use the risk-free interest rate

60
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,390
which reflects the time value of money as determined

61
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,830
in the financial market.

62
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,290
However, it is important to know that one year interest rate is

63
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,890
in general different from two year and five year interest

64
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,420
rates.

65
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,000
In general, cash flows are risky.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,710
In this case, we need to include the proper risk adjustment

67
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,390
in the discount rate--

68
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,150
namely, the risk premium associated

69
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,310
with the risk of the cash flow.

70
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,710
It is also important to keep in mind

71
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,860
that the risk for net asset's one year cash flow

72
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,930
can be quite different from the risk in its two year cash flow.

73
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,050
Consequently, the risk premium for each of these cash flows

74
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,410
are, in general, different.

75
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,720
Putting the pieces together, we have

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,670
the following present value formula,

77
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,690
where present value is the sum of the present values

78
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,990
of each piece of the asset's cash flow.

79
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,560
That is, the expected cash flow at each time, t,

80
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,400
discounted at rt, the appropriate discount rate

81
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,200
for that cash flow C FT.

82
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,270
Despite the fact that the discount rate for each cash

83
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,510
flow of an asset is in general different,

84
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,890
in most of our examples, we will use the same discount

85
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,940
rate for an asset's cash flow at different points in time.

86
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,610
It is important to keep in mind that this is mostly

87
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,000
for simplicity.
