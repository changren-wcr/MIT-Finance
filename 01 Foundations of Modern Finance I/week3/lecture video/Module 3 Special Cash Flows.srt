00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
PROFESSOR: We now apply the present value valuation method

1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,210
to a few simple cash flows.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,200
We do so for several reasons.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,150
First, to practice the new method we have just developed.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,340
Second, the simple cash flows we will consider are quite common

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,730
in the market as well as in our daily life.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,240
Third, these simple cash flows will also

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,080
be used to model the cash flows of various assets

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,490
as a first pass.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,870
In particular, we'll consider four special cash flows--

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,100
annuity, annuity with constant growth,

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,700
perpetuity, and perpetuity with constant growth.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,300


13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,420
Annuity refers to a constant cash flow,

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:57,170
say, a repeated for t periods starting from period one.

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,380
And this cash flow is also shown by this cash flow chart.

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,470
We're seeing a time zero for the next t periods,

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,220
we're going to be getting a constant cash flow a.

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,230
How do we value a cash flow like this?

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,440
Assuming that we know that discount rate is r.

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,800
What we would like to compute is its present value

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,630
which will be the first cash flow a discounted back once

22
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,260
at 1 plus r plus the second cash flow, which

23
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,740
is also a discounted at the discount rate r

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,380
twice, and so on.

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,080
Now, in order to compute this, we

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,640
could either compute each of the terms, the present value

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,910
of each piece of the cash flow at the month,

28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:53,060
or we could actually try to find a simple formula.

29
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,520
In order to do so, let's do the following.

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,460
Take the first line, the present value formula.

31
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,000
Multiply both sides by 1 plus r.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,880
That gives us the second equation,

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,660
and then we take the difference between these two equations,

34
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,150
namely subtracting the first equation

35
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,830
from the second equation.

36
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,660
That gives us the third equation,

37
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,510
namely r times PV the present value of this annuity

38
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,670
is given by the two terms on the right-hand side, a minus a

39
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,620
divided by 1 plus r to the t-th power.

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,470
We can rearrange the terms and arriving

41
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,970
at the following formula, namely the present value of annuity

42
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,270
is just going to be given by a, the level of the cash

43
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:47,580
flow, times 1 over r times what's in the square bracket.

44
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,650
Of course, we can also compute the future value of annuity

45
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,800
which is given by simply the present value of annuity

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
times 1 plus r to the t-th power.

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,530
That's the equation at the bottom of the slide.

48
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,970
Let's consider an example.

49
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,210
Suppose an insurance company is selling

50
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,960
an annuity, a standard product from insurance companies,

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,650
that pays $10,000 per year for 20 years.

52
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,370
Suppose that the right discount rate is 5%.

53
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,890
The question is what should be the company

54
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,260
sell this product for?

55
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,200
Well, with the present value formula,

56
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,890
we can easily finish this computation.

57
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,730
The price for this annuity should be its present value,

58
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,080
and that's given by this formula.

59
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,100
The level of the annuity is $10,000.

60
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,180
We multiply that by 1 over the discount rate 5% times

61
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,170
what's in the parentheses.

62
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,200
If we finish this calculation, we're

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,930
going to be getting $124,622 roughly.

64
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,660
So that should be the price for this annuity.

65
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,030
Of course, in reality, the insurance company

66
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,860
might be selling at a price that's

67
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,670
a little bit higher than that to pocket some profit.

68
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:11,070
Next, we consider an annuity with a constant growth rate g

69
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,100
as shown in the cash flow chart here.

70
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,029
The first cash flow arrives in year one at a level a.

71
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:22,800
Then in year two, the cash flow grows to a times 1 plus g

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,180
and so on.

73
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,660
The last cash flow occurs at year t

74
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,790
with the level at a times 1 plus g to the t minus 1th power.

75
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:41,600
The question is, what is the present value of such annuity?

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,060
Well, the present value can be easy

77
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,230
computed by summing up the present value of each

78
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,160
of the cash flow.

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,110


80
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,830
If we use the same technique as we did for annuity

81
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,290
with no growth, we arrive at the formula

82
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,880
which is given by the second equation.

83
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,040
And we have two different cases.

84
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,700
In the general case where the growth rate of the cash flow

85
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,670
does not equal to the discount rate r, we have the first line.

86
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,890
In a special case where the growth rate

87
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,180
is the same as the discount rate,

88
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,220
then we have the second line.

89
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,590
If we know the growing annuity starting value, its time

90
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,960
span, and growth rate, and its discount rate,

91
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,880
we can easily compute its present value.

92
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,960
We now consider an example of a growing annuity.

93
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,760
This example resembles a saving plan for retirement.

94
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,940
Suppose that you are now at age of 30

95
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,180
and plan to have $2 million at age of 65 when you retire.

96
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,570
How do you draw up a saving plan to achieve that?

97
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,700
Suppose that at the end of each year,

98
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,960
you will act to save certain amount that grows by 5%

99
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,870
each year reflecting your growth in income.

100
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,030
The question is, how much should you

101
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,400
start saving now assuming that the return on your savings

102
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,060
is 8%?

103
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,930


104
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,100
We can make this calculation by thinking

105
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,200
in the following fashion.

106
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,030
If you want to have $2 million in 35 years,

107
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,880
its present value should be just $2 million

108
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,680
discounted back at 8% 35 times which

109
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,340
is given by the term on the right-hand side

110
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,630
of the equation.

111
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,260
On the left-hand side would be the present value

112
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,740
of the annuity with a growth rate

113
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:58,100
of 5% starting at the initial level of a.

114
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,720
Solving for a, we'll get the following result

115
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,075
which is $6,473.

116
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:08,450
That means that, actually, if you

117
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:14,630
start your savings next year at $6,473

118
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,720
and allow that saving to grow at 5% per year

119
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,040
for 35 years and the return on your savings

120
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:29,540
is 8%, then by the end of 35 years where you turn 65,

121
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,180
the total amount in your savings account

122
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,190
will be exactly $2 million as you planned.

123
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,340
We now consider another example.

124
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,510
Suppose you just won the lottery and it pays $100,000

125
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,160
a year for 20 years.

126
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,300
Suppose that actually this is the only asset you have.

127
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,490
Are you a millionaire?

128
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,540
Let's assume that actually the right discount rate is 10%.

129
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,180
Well, we can compute the present value

130
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:06,280
of the stream of cash flow at a level of $100,000 for 20 years.

131
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,640
Plug into the formula for the present value of annuity, what

132
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:16,720
we arrive at would be $851,356.

133
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,460
That's quite nice, but it's still

134
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,660
short of a million dollars.

135
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,240


136
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,040
What if the payments last for 50 years instead of 20 years?

137
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,090
Well, we use the same formula for the first value

138
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:36,100
of annuity except that actually now the time span is 50 years.

139
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:44,610
If we finished a calculation, we'll arrive at $991,481.

140
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,780
Certainly, that's higher than the level before,

141
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,760
but it's still shy of $1 million.

142
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,040


143
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,860
How about if you're going to get $100,000 payment forever?

144
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,930
Well, if we finished our calculation,

145
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,540
the present value of this perpetual annuity

146
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,310
would be exactly $1 million.

147
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,080


148
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,420
This leads us to the next special cash

149
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,320
flow, a perpetuity.

150
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,600
A perpetuity is like an annuity except that it

151
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,820
doesn't have a terminal date.

152
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,040
The cash flow goes on forever.

153
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,150
The present value of perpetuity at a level of a

154
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,680
is simply given by a divide by r, the discount rate

155
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,467
or the rate of return on your investments.

156
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:41,210


157
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,740
If instead of staying a constant,

158
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,640
the perpetuity also grows at a constant growth rate g,

159
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,590
then we arrive at the perpetuity with the constant growth.

160
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,370
It's cash flow is also shown in the cash flow chart.

161
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,090
It starts at year one at a level a,

162
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:07,460
and next year, it turns into a times 1 plus g and so on

163
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,220
and continues forever.

164
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,830
The present value of such a perpetuity

165
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,990
with the constant growth rate g is

166
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,170
given by the formula on the slide, namely

167
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:22,670
a divide by r, the discount rate, minus g, the growth rate.

168
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,790
Here, it must be that the discount rate is

169
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,860
greater than the growth rate.

170
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,500
Otherwise, the present value of this cash flow

171
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,010
would be infinity.

172
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,330
We now consider a simple example.

173
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,180
Let's look at a company, Super Growth,

174
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,390
which plans to pay an annual dividend next year

175
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,470
of $3 per share.

176
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,730
The dividend is expected to grow at 5% per year forever.

177
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,880
We also know that for companies of this risk class,

178
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,490
the expected rate of return is 10%.

179
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,040
What should be Super Growth's share price?

180
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,560
Well, it should be the present value of its future dividends.

181
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,730
We can complete this computation by using the present value

182
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,450
formula for perpetuity with constant growth, which

183
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,240
is given on the right-hand side of the equation.

184
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,370
Namely, $3 for the first dividend,

185
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,770
divide by 10%, which is a discount rate, minus 5%, which

186
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,250
is the growth rate.

187
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,610
And that gives us $60 which should

188
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,570
be the share price today.
