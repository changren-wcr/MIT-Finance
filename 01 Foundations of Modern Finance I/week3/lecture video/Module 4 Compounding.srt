00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,480
PROFESSOR: In previous examples, we effectively assume

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,590
that cash flows and discount rates are over the same period.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,870
For convenience in the exposition,

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,440
we often set the period to be one year.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,420
But in practice, this may not be the case.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,510
For example, cash flows may occur

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,150
more frequently than annually.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,480
And rates of return may be quoted or realized

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,540
more frequently than annually.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,700
Under these circumstances, we need to treat the time period

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,830
in a consistent manner.

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,110
In particular, interest or rate of return,

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,750
may be credited or charged more often than annually.

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,890
For example, for bank accounts and credit cards,

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,340
interest is charged daily.

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,830
For loans and leases, the interest

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,400
is often computed on a monthly basis.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,180
For bonds the interest is paid semi-annually.

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,220


20
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,470
For the same quoted interest rate,

21
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,320
the effective annual rate may differ,

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,760
depending on how frequent interests are received or paid.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,000
In the market interest rates are typically

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,500
quoted in the form of annual percentage rate, or APR,

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,820
with k periods of compounding within a year.

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,260
What this means is that the actual interest paid per period

27
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,640
is APR divided by k, the number of compounding periods,

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,460
and then compounded over the whole year.

29
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,430
In this case, the actual annual rate

30
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,160
could be quite different from APR,

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,790
depending on the number of compounding periods.

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,150
In order to see the effect of compounding,

33
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,830
let's consider the following example.

34
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:02,760
Suppose that the bank quotes us in interest of 10% APR.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,510
Depending on how the interest is compounded,

36
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,970
we'll arrive at quite different outcomes.

37
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,850
Let's suppose that we deposit $1,000.

38
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,377
If the compounding is annual, then

39
00:02:18,377 --> 00:02:20,460
what we're going to be getting will be an interest

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,070
of 10% on the principle.

41
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:29,560
That is $100 at the end of the year, and that would be $1,100.

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,030
And that's given by the second column in the table.

43
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,740
But what if the compound is semiannual?

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,470
In that case, the interest would be

45
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,780
half of the 10% APR paid over every 6 months.

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,960
The outcome is given by the third column.

47
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,300
We start with a balance of $1,000.

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,550
In 6 months that turned into $1,050.

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,510
That's $1,000 plus 5% of 6 months' interest.

50
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,490
And therefore the next 6 months, we're

51
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,280
going to be getting another 5% of interest

52
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,790
on the starting balance of $1,050.

53
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,310
So by the end of the year, we'll be getting $1,103.

54
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,860
Clearly, that's different from the previous case

55
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,790
when the 10% APR is compounded annually.

56
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,670
The fourth column gives the situation

57
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,710
when the 10% APR is compounded quarterly.

58
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,400
Here for every quarter, we're getting 2 and 1/2%

59
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,960
of the interest.

60
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,850
But that accumulates over three quarters.

61
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,610
The last column gives the outcome

62
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,940
if the interest is compounded monthly.

63
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,240
And by the end of the year, the $1,000

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:59,000
of principal at the beginning of year would turn into $1,105.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,020
As we can see, as the compounding periods increase,

66
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,600
we're actually going to be gaining more outcome.

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,510
And the reason is that when interests

68
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,750
are paid more frequently, we're earning interest

69
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,310
on the interest payments paid previously.

70
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,490
Let's now look at another example

71
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,170
in slightly more detail.

72
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,450
Suppose that actually Bank of America

73
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,930
offers one-year certificates of deposits

74
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,410
at an APR of 5% with semi-annual compounding.

75
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,900
If you invest $10,000, how much money

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,050
do you have at the end of one year?

77
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,560
What is the actual interest rate that you earn?

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,000


79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,010
Well first, we already know the quoted APR of 5%

80
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,910
is not the actual annual rate, because the compounding is not

81
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,050
annual.

82
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,580
It's only used to compute the 6-month interest rate, which

83
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,410
will be half of the 5%.

84
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,160
That's 2 and 1/2%.

85
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,340
If we invest $10,000 at the beginning of a year,

86
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,240
then by the year end what we would have

87
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,390
would be $10,000 times 1 plus 2 and 1/2%.

88
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:26,290
That's for 6 months' interest, then times 1 plus 2 and 1/2%

89
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,290
again for the second 6-month period.

90
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:39,060
In total, the end balance would be $10,506.25.

91
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,990
In the second 6-month period you earn interest

92
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,610
on the interest paid for the first 6 months.

93
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,300
So the actual annual rate, which is also

94
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,960
called the effective annual rate, or EAR,

95
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,165
is given by this last equation on a slide.

96
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:04,920
The effective annual rate equals to 1 plus 2 and 1/2%

97
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,850
compounded twice, because we have two compounding periods

98
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,710
within a year, then minus 1.

99
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,610
That gives 5.0625%.

100
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,490
That is the actual annual interest

101
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,530
rate we're earning on this CD.

102
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,450
More generally, we can compute the effective annual rate

103
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,820
from the APR plus the number of compounding periods.

104
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,260
Let our APR be the APR, and k the number of compounding

105
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,720
intervals per year.

106
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,380
Then in one year, $1 invested today

107
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,470
would yield 1 plus the APR divided by k.

108
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,310
That's the actual interest rate paid for each period.

109
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,160
And then compound it k times.

110
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,090
The effective annual rate is then

111
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,900
given by the following equation, namely 1

112
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,810
plus the effective annual rate should

113
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,820
equal to 1 plus the interest per compounding period,

114
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,310
then compound it 10 times.

115
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,300
And this gives us the equation on the bottom right

116
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,500
of the slide.

117
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,650
The effective annual rate is basically the gross return

118
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,360
over the year, minus 1.

119
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,690
We can further see the relationship

120
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,360
between the effective annual rate

121
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,430
and the number of compounding periods,

122
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,080
holding constant the APR.

123
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,230
Suppose that the APR is 5%.

124
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,020
Then the effective annual rate we're

125
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,190
going to be getting as described in the table below,

126
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,880
depends on the number of compounding periods.

127
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,590
If k is 1, then that means that the compounding

128
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,490
is on an annual basis.

129
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,880
Then the effective annual rate is just 5%, same as the APR.

130
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,240
If k equals 2, that is if the compounding is semi-annual,

131
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,080
then the effective annual rate will be 5.0625%.

132
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,790
That's higher than the 5% we are getting

133
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,330
if the compounding is annual.

134
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,130
If compounding is on a monthly basis, namely k equals 12,

135
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,720
then we get the third row, the effective annual rate

136
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,860
will be 5.1162%.

137
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,200
What if k equals 365?

138
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,590
That means that the compounding is on a daily basis.

139
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:47,110
Then the effective annual rate will be 5.1267%.

140
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,720
How about on an hourly basis?

141
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,490
That is when k equals 8,760.

142
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,920
Nobody really does that, but here

143
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,250
is just as an illustration.

144
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,410
Then the effective annual rate will be 5.1271.

145
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,450
What if the compounding is continuous?

146
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,080
Then what we're getting as the effective annual rate will

147
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,840
be 5.1271.

148
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,720
And that's fairly close to the hourly compounding result.

149
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,480
Of course nobody really does continuous compounding.

150
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,410
But as we'll see later on, for mathematical convenience,

151
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,930
sometimes we assume the compounding

152
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,870
is continues to arrive at some simple results.
