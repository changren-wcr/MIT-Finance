00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,370
PROFESSOR: Before we finish our discussion on special cash

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,790
flows in compounding, we would like

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,890
to look at one more example, mortgage calculation.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,660
Here, we are going to be looking at a fixed rate mortgage that's

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,130
typical in the United States.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,890
It often requires a 20% down payment

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,240
and borrow the rest from a bank using the property

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,090
as collateral.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,670
Over time of the mortgage, the borrower

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,210
would pay a fixed monthly payment

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,620
and, typically, the borrower also has the option to prepay.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,610
Namely, during the time of the mortgage if the interest

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,430
rate moves in the desirable direction,

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,610
the borrower can actually borrow more money

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,670
from the market at a lower rate and then repay

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,720
the previous mortgage.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,290


18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,460
Now let's consider a specific example.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,220
Suppose that you're buying a house for $500,000, half

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,860
a million dollars, with 20% down payment, that is $100,000.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,960
And then finance the remaining part

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,840
which is $400,000 using a 30 year fixed rate mortgage.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,030
Let's assume that the mortgage rate

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,430
is 8.5% APR compounded monthly because the mortgage

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,870
payments are typically on a monthly basis.

26
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,370
The question we would like to answer

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,155
is, what would be the monthly payment for this mortgage?

28
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:39,370


29
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,630
Well, the monthly payment for this mortgage

30
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,230
is really like annuity with 360 payments,

31
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:53,740
monthly payments, at some level, let's say, M. Now for this deal

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,700
to be fair, the present value of all these monthly mortgage

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,090
payments should equal to the amount of money

34
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,210
we are borrowing, namely $400,000.

35
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,020
So if you write down this equation,

36
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,070
on the left-hand side is the amount we are borrowing,

37
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,560
on the right-hand side is the present value

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
of all the future mortgage payments we have to pay,

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,910
total 360 of them on a monthly basis.

40
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,280
If the monthly payment is M, we can look at each one of them,

41
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,750
discount them back using the mortgage interest rate.

42
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,320
Keep in mind that the mortgage interest rate 8.5

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,090
is an APR with monthly compounding.

44
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:42,280
So the actual monthly interest is 8.5% divide by 12.

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,030
So if we use the present value formula

46
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,300
for annuity, what we're going to be getting

47
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,830
will be the right-hand side of the second equation.

48
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,080
What's unknown here is the monthly payment M.

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,060
If we solve for that, we're going

50
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,420
to be adding arriving at the following result.

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:09,610
The monthly payment would be $3,075.65.

52
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,700
What is that effective annual interest rate

53
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,770
we're paying on this mortgage?

54
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,890
That is not 8.5%, the APR, because that APR is

55
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,210
compounded on a monthly basis.

56
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,140
Using our EAR formula, we can easily

57
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,970
compute the effective annual rate

58
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,040
for this mortgage, which is given

59
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,320
by the last equation on the slide, that

60
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,860
is 8.839% rather than 8.5%.

61
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,560
So this computation is really what's behind mortgage loans.

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,350
What we have shown is that for a mortgage

63
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,820
of $400,000 at a mortgage rate of 8.5%

64
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,130
APR with monthly compounding, the actual monthly payment

65
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,070
is $3,075.65.

66
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,190
And that's shown in the second column

67
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,170
of the table on the slide.

68
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,700
And of course, given that this is a 30-year mortgage payment,

69
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,829
the monthly payments will continue

70
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:23,480
for 30 years with a total of 360 monthly payments.

71
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,240
What we can also show is that the monthly payment

72
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,260
of $3,075.65 consists of two pieces.

73
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,250
One part is the interest on the remaining principal,

74
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,980
the other part is the amount that we're

75
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,250
paying down the principal.

76
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,650
So the interest payments, over the life span of the mortgage,

77
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,710
is given by the third column in a table shown in red.

78
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:01,510
So for the first month, the interest payment is $2,833.33.

79
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:08,650
That's, that is a bigger chunk of the monthly payment.

80
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:15,790
Only $242.37 is used from the monthly payment

81
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,100
to pay down the principal.

82
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,950
After the first month of mortgage payment,

83
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,060
the remaining principal is given by the last column.

84
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:36,620
The first row gives us $399,757.68.

85
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,660
Then for the second month, the interest payment

86
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,210
would be 8.5% divide by 12, that's

87
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,380
the monthly interest times, the remaining principal that's

88
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,200
$399,757.68.

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,870
That will give us the second row in the third column.

90
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,810
That's the interest payment of $2,831.62.

91
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,090
The difference between that and the monthly payment,

92
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,570
which is $244.04, that's the second row

93
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,440
in the fourth column, that is the amount

94
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,800
from the second monthly payment that goes into paying down

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,680
the principal.

96
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,040
And after the second monthly mortgage payment,

97
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,940
the remaining principal is given by the second row

98
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:40,390
of the last column, $399,513.64.

99
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,220
And we can keep going through this calculation

100
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,510
all the way to the last month of the mortgage.

101
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,360
So for the last month's mortgage,

102
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,140
which is given by the last row in the table,

103
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,260
the total monthly payment is still $3,075.65.

104
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:04,710
Out of that only $21.63 is paying the interest

105
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,300
on the remaining principal.

106
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,780
$3,054.02 goes to paying down the remaining principal.

107
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,830
Of course, by that time, the remaining principal

108
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,420
will be paid down to zero and the mortgage is completed.

109
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,130
We can also show this through this graph.

110
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,820
What's shown here is the percentage

111
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:39,260
of the monthly mortgage payment, namely $3,075 or so.

112
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,620
What percentage goes to the interest payment

113
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,280
and what percentage goes into paying down the principal?

114
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,350
The red gives us the fraction of the mortgage payment

115
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,420
that's paying the interest.

116
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,070
And the blue shows the percentage

117
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,320
of the monthly mortgage payment that's used

118
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,480
to paying down the principal

119
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,020
Over the lifespan of the mortgage,

120
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,250
as we can see the fraction of interest payment

121
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,830
actually at the beginning, takes most part

122
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,320
of the monthly payment, but over time, actually

123
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,920
decreases, eventually hits zero.

124
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,050
For the percentage of monthly payment

125
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,020
paying down the principal, it's just the opposite.

126
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,830
At the beginning, only a small fraction of the monthly payment

127
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,350
goes into paying down the principal.

128
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,250
But over time, it increases.

129
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:31,220
By the end of the mortgage lifespan, it's almost 100%

130
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,370
of the monthly payment.
