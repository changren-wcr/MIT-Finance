00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300


1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,730
PROFESSOR: The key input in asset valuation

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,250
is the discount rate, or the rate of return

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,160
as expected by the market.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,690
It depends on the timing and risk of an asset's payoff.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,190
We will devote more time later on this relationship.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,010
For now, we would like to get a rough idea

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,370
about the rates of return on a set of broad asset

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,070
classes traded in the market, with a range of timing and risk

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,840
characteristics.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,180
They will give us an empirical sense

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,850
on the magnitudes of discount rates

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,770
and their dependence on timing and risk.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,210
We will start with some notation and definitions.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,080
We'll use P0 to denote the price of an asset

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,360
at the beginning of a period.

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,660
P1 will be its price at the end of the period, which

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,110
is generally uncertain, at least at the beginning of the period.

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,820
D1 gives the dividend at the end of the period, which

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,830
is also uncertain.

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,400
We can then define the return or the rate of return

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,300
from the asset over this given period.

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,090
r denotes notes the return, which is

23
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,620
given by D1 plus P1 minus P0.

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,020
That gives the net payoff at the end

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,840
of the period, divided by P0 which

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,080
is the initial investment.

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,080


28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,250
The rate of return, of course, is in general uncertain given

29
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,590
that D1 and P1 are uncertain.

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,260
However, we can still compute the expected rate

31
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,750
of return, which is the expected value of the realized return.

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,440
We denote that by r bar.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,950
If an asset is riskless, its return

34
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,370
which we'll then note by rF, is sometimes

35
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,460
called the risk-free rate, which reflects

36
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,030
the time value of money.

37
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,180
There is no risk here.

38
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,979
For a risky asset, its return net of the risk-free rate

39
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,040
is often called the excess return.

40
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,400
This is the return in excess of the risk-free return,

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,290
and typically this reflects the compensation for the risk

42
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,600
that we are bearing by investing in this asset.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,000
The expected value of the excess return,

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
which is given by r bar minus rF,

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,530
is also called the risk premium on the asset,

46
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,240
or the price of risk.

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,300
It gives us the expected compensation

48
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,720
for bearing the risk of investing in this asset.

49
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,740
We now consider the returns on the major asset classes

50
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,970
traded in the US market over a fairly long period,

51
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,470
from 1926 to 2018.

52
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,220
It will give us a sense about the returns

53
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,480
and risks of these assets.

54
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,790
Going from shorter horizon and lower risk

55
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,280
to longer horizon and higher risk,

56
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,000
we consider five asset classes.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,080
The first is the short-term government bonds, also called

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,760
treasury bills.

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,340
They have cash rules typically over a horizon

60
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,550
of no more than a year, and they are fairly safe.

61
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,470
The next asset class will be long-term government bonds,

62
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,090
and they have payoffs over a time horizon

63
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,090
typically more than a year, and they probably

64
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,410
are riskier than the short-term government bonds.

65
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,520
The next asset class will be corporate bonds.

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,840
These are bonds issued by corporations,

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,500
and they are typically riskier than long-term government

68
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,370
bonds.

69
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,400
It is not shown in the figure, because it

70
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,270
will be too close to the plot for government bonds.

71
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,270
Then the next asset class is large-sized stocks.

72
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,240
These are stocks issued by large companies.

73
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,060
And the last asset class will be small-sized stocks.

74
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,760
These are stocks issued by small companies.

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,200
In addition, we also include the inflation index,

76
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,440
which reflects the price appreciation of real goods.

77
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,870
Presumably assets in each one of these asset classes

78
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,510
have risk levels that is sort of comparable,

79
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,150
while across different asset classes

80
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,490
the risk levels could be quite different.

81
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,220
What is shown in the plot is the cumulative returns

82
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,890
on $1 invested in any one of these asset classes

83
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:57,540
at the end of 1925 to the end of 2018, over a total of 93 years.

84
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,170
What we can look at is actually these five asset classes,

85
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,890
starting from the ones with lower risks.

86
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,850
We'll first start with inflation,

87
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,870
which is given by the blue dashed line

88
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,250
at the bottom of the plot.

89
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:21,770
For $1 invested at the end of 1925 by the end of 2018,

90
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,910
it will be worth $14.02.

91
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,120
The next line up, the red dashed line,

92
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,400
is the cumulative return from $1 invested over this period

93
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,080
in short-term government bonds.

94
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:46,920
So that $1 at the end of 1925 would have turned into $21.17.

95
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,270
As we can see from the return of short-term government bonds,

96
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,830
the returns are not very high, but it's very smooth.

97
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:04,990
It reflects a fairly safe and low return over time.

98
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,470
The third line is the blue line, and that

99
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,420
reflects the cumulative return from investing

100
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,350
in a $1 in long-term government bonds.

101
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:27,290
That $1 at the end of 1925 would have turned into $142.

102
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,600
This is quite bit higher than what

103
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,770
we would have got by investing in short-term government bonds.

104
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,990
However, nothing is free.

105
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,640
If we look at the cumulative return line, it is more wiggly.

106
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,650
It can go up and down.

107
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,330
That reflects the risk from investing

108
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,360
in long-term government bonds.

109
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,070
Then the next line up is the lighter red line

110
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,880
that reflects the cumulative return from investing

111
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,430
in large-sized stocks.

112
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:10,520
So $1 at the end of 1925 would turn into $7,030

113
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,680
by the end of 2018.

114
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,550
That's a lot higher than the $142

115
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,090
we would have got by investing in long-term government bonds.

116
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,740
Now of course, this high return is not free either.

117
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,890
If you look at the line itself, it

118
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:34,450
wiggles a lot more largely than the blue line,

119
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,820
which is the investment in long-term government bonds.

120
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,250
And clearly this reflects a much higher level of risk

121
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,190
from stocks.

122
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,060
Then the very top line gives the cumulative return

123
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,300
from investing in small-sized stocks.

124
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:59,630
So $1 at the end of 1925 would have turned into $32,645.

125
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,450
That's quite a bit higher than the total return

126
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,370
from investing in large stocks.

127
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,240


128
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,050
From this chart, we can clearly see as we go from the bottom

129
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,260
to the top, we are looking at asset classes

130
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,710
with increasing levels of risk, but also we're

131
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,430
getting over this period of time, a higher return.

132
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,550


133
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,980
This indicates a connection, a positive connection,

134
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,880
between the level of risk and the return

135
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,940
we will get from that asset traded in a market.

136
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,059
In this relationship is going to be

137
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,650
the focus of our future analysis of different asset

138
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,210
pricing models and risk analysis.
