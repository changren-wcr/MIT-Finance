00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,520
PROFESSOR: Jeff Bezos recently made an announcement

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,580
that he would donate $10 billion to combat climate change.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,210
Suppose that he plans to establish

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,180
a foundation to which he will pledge the entire amount of $10

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,680
billion.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,180
Every year his foundation will distribute funds

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,600
to organizations that fight climate change.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,120
Let's assume that the foundation will invest funds

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,930
into financial assets that will on average generate

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:34,340
nominal annual rate of return of 8%.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,840
Now the first question is asking us

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,590
if Bezos' foundation wants to be able to distribute funds

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,430
in perpetuity and if they plan to distribute the same dollar

14
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:51,330
amount each year, what will be the annual distribution amount?

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,270
Now we will assume that the first distribution happens

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,190
in exactly one year from now.

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,430
Notice that the distribution stream from the foundation

18
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,140
represents perpetuity.

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,720
Suppose that the annual distribution equals

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,270
to C dollars, then the present value of the stream of payments

21
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,220
can be written as present value equals to C divided by 1

22
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,680
plus r, plus C divided by 1 plus r squared, plus C divided by 1

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,950
plus r cubed, and so forth.

24
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,450
Remember this is a perpetuity, so this is an infinite stream

25
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,920
of cash flow.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,340
We have learned in the lecture that the present value

27
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,270
of such perpetuity equals to C divided by r.

28
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,780
Now the question gives us the present value

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,160
of this perpetuity.

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,580
This is the amount of money that Jeff Bezos

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,890
pledged to the foundation, which is $10 billion.

32
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,410
Now given the interest rate of 8%

33
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,560
we can solve this equation for the annual payment

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,110
amount, which would be C equals present value

35
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:08,810
multiplied by interest rate r or in this case $10 billion

36
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:15,655
multiplied by 8%, which would be equal to $800 million.

37
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:17,000
