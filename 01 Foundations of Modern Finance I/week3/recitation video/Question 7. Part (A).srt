1
00:00:00,697 --> 00:00:02,530
PROFESSOR: Let's start solving this question

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,840
by first computing monthly interest rates

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,029
on the old and the new loan.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,250
Recall that, on the old loan, we're

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,370
paying 6.5% effective annual rate.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,470
To find the monthly rate, let's start

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,670
with the following equation.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,630
So 1 plus effective annual rate would equal to 1

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,010
plus monthly rate raised to the power of 12.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,870
From this equation, we can find monthly rate

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,200
by just inverting it.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,530
So it's going to be, 1 plus effective annual rate

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,500
raised to the power of 1 over 12 minus 1.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,890
So it's going to be 1 plus 6% raised to the power of 1

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,760
over 12 minus 1.

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:57,670
And this would give me 0.487%.

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,890
So this is the monthly rate that we're paying on the old loan.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,739
To find the monthly interest rate on the new loan,

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,480
note that the new loan is quoted to us as annual percentage rate

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,010
monthly component.

21
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,060
So therefore, for us to find the monthly rate, all we have to do

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,720
is, we're taking this monthly component APR

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,140
and we're dividing it by 12, which is 4.5% divided by 12.

24
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,920
This would be 0.375%.

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,740
So this is the interest--

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,310
monthly interest on the new loan, and up here

27
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,990
was the monthly interest rate that we're

28
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,810
paying on the old loan.

29
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,610
So you can already see that we got a better

30
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,840
deal on the new loan.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,080
So therefore, refinancing the old mortgage

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,500
with the new mortgage would lower our monthly payments.

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,980
Now, let's find monthly payments on the old and the new loan

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,570
and compare them.

35
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,480
First, let's start with the old loan.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,250


37
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,340
So the current value, the present value

38
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,640
of the mortgage that we have is $300,000.

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,450
So this must equal to the monthly payment

40
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,630
that we're making--

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,350
and I will denoted it as c o--

42
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,370
as the monthly payment on the old mortgage, divided by r m.

43
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,780
So this would be the rate--

44
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,840
the monthly rate on the old mortgage

45
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,690
multiplied by 1 minus 1 divided by 1 plus r

46
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:42,410
m raised to the power 240.

47
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,390
240 because we have 20 years left

48
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,970
on the life of this mortgage.

49
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,080
And so for us to find our monthly payment, all

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,420
we have to do, we have to invert this equation.

51
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,630
So it's going to be $300,000 and then

52
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:09,760
we'll divide it by 1 divided by r m, 1 minus 1

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,210
divided by 1 plus r m, raised to the power of 240.

54
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,690
If we solve this equation by plugging in the interest

55
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,020
rate of 0.487%, the monthly interest rate,

56
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,510
we will get c o, which is the, again, monthly payment

57
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:39,060
on the old mortgage of $2,121.88.

58
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,900
Now, let's do the same for the new loan.

59
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,440


60
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,130
So I can write down the same equation.

61
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,010
So it's the same if we were to refinance.

62
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,680
Right now, we need to still raise

63
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,280
the present value of $300,000 so that the proceeds

64
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,550
from the new loan can be used to repay the old loan.

65
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,940
And that again would be equal to our monthly payments.

66
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,580
And I will denote it as c n, to denote

67
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,760
the new payment, the new loan, divided by r m 1 minus 1

68
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,570
plus r m also raised to the power of 240.

69
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,670
So now this r m is the interest rate on the new loan.

70
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,410
And I can find c n, similarly, by just

71
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,000
inverting this equation.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,770
So c n is going to equal to $300,000 divided

73
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:41,860
by 1 divided by r m, 1 minus 1 plus 1 r m

74
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,860
raised to the power of 240.

75
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,210
And so if we compute-- if we plug-in

76
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,560
r m that equals to 0.375%, we're going

77
00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:02,120
to get monthly payment on this loan of $1,897.95.

78
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,210
Now we can see that by refinancing the old loan

79
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,140
with the new loan, we're saving the difference

80
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,310
between these two amounts.

81
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,920
What we used to pay on the old loan and our new

82
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,870
lower monthly payments.

83
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,880
The difference is about $223.93.

84
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,200
So this is by how much we're lowering our monthly payment

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,500
on the mortgage.

86
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,000
