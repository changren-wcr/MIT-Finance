00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,980
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,920
learn how to work with effective annual rates

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,140
and with annual percentage rates.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,840
Let's start with Part A of this question.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,600
A credit card company charges you 20% annual percentage

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,820
rate or APR compounded monthly.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,495
What is the Effective Annual Rate or EAR

8
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:26,620
that you are being charged?

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,130


10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,140
To find the effective annual rate,

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,290
we use the formula we developed in the lecture.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:44,340
EAR equals to 1 plus APR divided by k,

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,860
and raised to the power k, minus 1,

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,620
where k is the number of compounding intervals

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,230
in a year.

16
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,570
In our case APR equals to 20% and k equals to 12

17
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,740
because the credit card company compounds interest monthly

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,630
and there are 12 months in a year.

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:16,240
This gives us EAR of 21.94%.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,500
Overall this result indicates that the bank effectively

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,010
charges us 21.94% which is substantially higher compared

22
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:32,330
to the APR of 20%.

23
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,570
Let's continue with Part B of this question.

24
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,060
Suppose that you work for a credit card company

25
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,990
and you would like to earn an effective annual rate of 25%

26
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,140
on your credit card loans.

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,070
You are free to choose a compounding interval

28
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,200
with the only constraint that the shortest

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,800
period has to be one day.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,230
Assuming that you want to present the lowest

31
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,980
APR to your customers, what is the optimal frequency

32
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,990
of compounding?

33
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:06,360
What is the APR at the optimal compounding frequency?

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,860
As we have seen in the lecture, for a given APR,

35
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,680
the higher the frequency of compounding, the higher

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,590
is the effective annual rate.

37
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,920
Our goal in this question is to find the optimal compounding

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,960
frequency for a given EAR that would result in the lowest APR.

39
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,300
Intuitively, for a fixed EAR, we should compound interest

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,450
as frequently as possible because the higher compounding

41
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,950
frequency will lead to lower APR.

42
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,580
In our case, the optimal frequency of compounding

43
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,880
should be daily.

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,820
Let's do the following.

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,820
First, we will compute APR assuming daily compounding.

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,750
Then we will compute APR assuming quarterly compounding.

47
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,870
And then we will generalize this result.

48
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,650
Let's start with daily compounding.

49
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,650
Assume that there are 365 days in a year.

50
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:14,325
For a given effective annual rate of 25%, let's find APR.

51
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:15,950
Let's start with the basic relationship

52
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,370
between EAR and APR.

53
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,350
1 plus effective annual rate equals

54
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,830
to 1 plus APR divided by k which is the compounding frequency

55
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,490
raised to the power of k.

56
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,250
We can rearrange this equation to find APR

57
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,430
as a function of EAR.

58
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,970
APR would equal to k, the compounding frequency

59
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,660
multiplied by 1 plus EAR raised to the power of 1

60
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,830
over k minus 1.

61
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,990
For an effective annual rate of 25%

62
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,560
in daily compounded interest, APR in this case

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,290
would be 22.3%.

64
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,820
Now let's compute APR if interest is compounded

65
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,280
quarterly instead of daily.

66
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,350
In this case, compounding frequency k

67
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:13,410
would equal to 4, which would give us an APR of 22.9%.

68
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,040
Therefore, if we choose quarterly compounding,

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,100
the APR of 22.9% would give us effective annual rate of 25%.

70
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,400
But if we choose daily compounding the APR of 22.3%

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,290
would still give us the effective annual rate of 25%.

72
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,550
So given that we want to earn effective annual rate of 25%

73
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,470
and we want to display the lowest

74
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,110
APR to our customer as possible, we

75
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,810
should choose daily compounding.

76
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,390
This would allow us to advertise APR of 22.3%.

77
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,760
Let's generalize this result.

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,460
Here, I have created an array that

79
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,090
denotes the frequency of compounding from 1 all the way

80
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,780
to 365.

81
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,070
One corresponds to annual compounding and 365

82
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,940
corresponds to daily compounding.

83
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,620
Now for each of these intervals, I will compute APR.

84
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,770
We see that for quarterly compounding

85
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,390
APR equals to 22.9% which matches

86
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,360
the number we found before.

87
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,680
For annual compounding when k equals to 1,

88
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,400
APR is 25% which intuitively should be correct

89
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,400
because when interest is compounded annually

90
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,590
APR should equal to EAR.

91
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,490
Now the plot to the right shows APR

92
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,850
as a function of compounding interval for a given

93
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,740
effective annual rate of 25%.

94
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,130
This is a decreasing function which

95
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,210
indicates that highest compounding frequency

96
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,090
corresponds to lowest APR.

97
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,140
Recall that for daily compounding interest,

98
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,000
APR equals to 22.3%.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,980
Overall, this illustrates that our decision

100
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,930
to go with daily compounding is the right one.
