1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,160
PROFESSOR: This question teaches you

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,030
how to find a present value of an annuity.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,390
Suppose that you have an outstanding loan that requires

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,180
ten annual payments of $2,300.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,940
Now is Year 0, and the next payment on the loan

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,250
is due next year.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,820
The last payment is due in Year 10.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,650
There is a bank account that offers 5% annual interest rate.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,190
You would like to make a deposit into this account today, which

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,970
would allow you to repay this loan.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,470
The first part of this question asks

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,220
you to find the amount that you need to deposit.

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,920
The second question asks you to demonstrate

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,800
that the amount you deposited is indeed

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,070
enough to repay this loan.

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,680
Let's start with the first question.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,640
The money you need to deposit is the present value

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,100
of these payments discounted at 5%.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,650


20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,660
To find the present value, we can use the annuity formula.

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,310
Present value would equal to $2,300, which

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,850
is our annual payment, divided by 5%, multiplied by 1 minus 1

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,630
divided by 1 plus 5%, raised to the power of 10

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,940
because we have 10 payments.

25
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,870
This would equal to $17,760.

26
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,720
Let me demonstrate that if we discount

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,850
annual payments by hand, we will get the same answer.

28
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,740
Let me start with the first payment

29
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,270
and find its present value.

30
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,010
I will take the payment itself, and I will divide it

31
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,510
by 1 plus discount rate.

32
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,350
Raise to the power of 1 because this payment

33
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,280
occurs one year from now.

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,670
If I extend this array all the way to Year 10,

35
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,480
this will give me the present value of each

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,430
of these individual payments.

37
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,830
For example, the very last cell gives me

38
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,449
the present value of the last payment, $2,300,

39
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,440
discounted to the present.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,060
We are raising it to power of 10 because this payment occurs

41
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,460
in Year 10.

42
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,620
To find the total value of these payments in present value

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,260
terms, we will just add them up.

44
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,140


45
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:37,890
This gives us exactly $17,760, the same value that we obtained

46
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,480
by using the annuity formula.

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,750
Let's answer the second part of this question

48
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,220
by demonstrating that depositing $17,760

49
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,140
is enough to fully repay this loan.

50
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,050
We're beginning Year 1 with this much money in our bank account.

51
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,730
During this first year, the bank pays us 5% interest rate

52
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,300
on this amount.

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,880
So the interest that we earned would

54
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,650
equal to the beginning balance multiplied

55
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,200
by the interest rate of 5%.

56
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,840


57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,020
At the end of Year 1, we are making our annual payment.

58
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,840
And therefore, the end balance would

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,260
equal to the beginning balance plus the interest

60
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,420
that you earned minus the payment that we made.

61
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,300
Then, we're starting second year by having this much money

62
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,580
in our bank account.

63
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,870
During this year, we're still earning 5% interest

64
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,210
on this balance.

65
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,000
And we're making the same payments.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,940
And we're ending this year with the balance

67
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,110
in our account of $14,865.

68
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,920
Now, let's see what happens if we extend these

69
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,820
arrays all the way to Year 10.

70
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,470
We will see that we will start Year 10 by having

71
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,600
$2,190 in our bank account.

72
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,350
During this year, we're earning 5% interest on this beginning

73
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,880
balance, which is exactly enough to pay

74
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,079
$2,300 at the end of this year, which leaves us

75
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,920
with the balance of exactly $0.

76
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,170
We just demonstrated that depositing $17,760 now

77
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,820
into a bank account that pays the annual interest rate of 5%

78
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,060
is enough to repay this loan.

79
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,090
Overall, what we learned in this question

80
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,960
is how to find a present value of a stream of cash flows

81
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,950
that represents an annuity.
