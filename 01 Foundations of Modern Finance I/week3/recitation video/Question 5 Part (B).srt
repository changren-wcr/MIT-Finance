00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,220
PROFESSOR: Let's start by assuming

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,290
that the annual distribution amount equals

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,780
to c, similar to what we did in part a of this question.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,840
Then we can write down the present value

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,500
of this stream of distributions from Jeff Bezos' foundation.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,760
It's going to equal to c-- this is the current distribution--

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,120
plus c divided by 1 plus r-- this is the present value

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,780
of the second distribution, which will happen one year from

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,040
today--

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,840
plus c divided by 1 plus r squared--

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,100
this is the present value of the third distribution, which will

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,900
happen two years from now--

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,010
plus c divided by 1 plus r raised to the power of 3,

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,530
which is the present value of the fourth distribution, which

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,950
will happen three years from now, and so forth.

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,080
Now, we need to find the present value of this amount

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,540
on the right hand side of this equation.

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,690
To do this, notice that this part of the equation

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,599
is just the regular perpetuity.

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,880
And we already know the present value

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,040
of the regular perpetuity.

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,800
Therefore, we can write down this equation as such.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,210
So the present value of this stream of cash flows

24
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,320
equals to c plus c divided by r.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,210
Now, we know that the present value

26
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,950
of the pledged amount to the foundation is $10 billion.

27
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,450
Given that the interest rate is 8%,

28
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,180
we can solve this equation for the annual payment amount.

29
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,830
So the annual payment amount c would

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,350
equal to the present value divided

31
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,310
by 1 plus 1 divided by r.

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,550
Plugging in the numbers, $10 billion and 8% interest rate,

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:55,160
would get $740,740,740.

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,010
Therefore, the annual distribution amount

35
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:03,460
will be around $741 million.

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,620
Note that if Jeff Bezos starts distributing funds

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,550
in one year from now, the annual perpetual distribution amount

38
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,520
will be $800 million.

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,110
If on the other hand, he starts distributing money immediately,

40
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,220
this lowers the annual perpetual distribution amount

41
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,270
to $741 million.

42
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,630
This does make economic sense due to the fact

43
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:37,870
that the immediate distribution lowers the balance of funds

44
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,990
on the foundation's balance sheet,

45
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,920
and therefore lowers its ability to earn 8% annual interest

46
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,090
rate on this amount.
