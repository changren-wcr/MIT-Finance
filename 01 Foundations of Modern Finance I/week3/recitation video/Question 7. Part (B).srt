1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,200
PROFESSOR: Now, let's do cash out refinance.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,700
So instead of lowering our monthly mortgage payments,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,900
we will continue paying the same amount as we paid before.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,570
But because this new mortgage is cheaper,

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,690
we will be able to borrow a larger amount from a bank

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,400
and pay the existing loan and use the remaining

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,060
cash for other purposes, such as, as the question states,

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,820
buying a new car or doing something else.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,470
So the question is, given this new cheaper rate, how much we

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,160
can borrow if we were to continue paying the same amount

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,770
that we paid before on our old mortgage.

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,050
So the answer is simply this.

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,050
So this question is asking us to find the present value

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,040
of our old payment.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:53,600
Recall that our old payment was $2,121.88.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,300
At the new monthly rate, which was 0.375%.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,902
So 0.375%.

18
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:05,319
I'm just using the annuity formula

19
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,890
to find the present value of this amount.

20
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:15,470
1 minus 1 divided by 1 plus this interest rate

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,980
raised to the power of 240.

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,855
Recall that this is a 20 year loan on which we

23
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:27,310
are paying monthly payments, so there are 240 months.

24
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,320
And by computing this amount--

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,420
this is the present value of how much we will be able to borrow.

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:42,890
This gives me $335,395.29.

27
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,320
We will take this new loan from the bank

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,950
and pay $300,000 on our existing mortgage to the other bank,

29
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,560
therefore leaving ourselves with $35,395.29.

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,000
