00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,400
PROFESSOR: Now, suppose that the expected future annual rate

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,720
of inflation is 2%.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,900
If Jeff Bezos wants to distribute

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,440
an equal annual amount in today's dollars

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,040
to guarantee purchasing power of distributed funds,

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,580
how much would the annual distribution amount be?

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,140
Assume that the first distribution

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,450
happens one year from now.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,120
Suppose that the annual distribution from the fund

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,400
equals c dollars.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,680
Let's denote by i the annual rate of inflation.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,690
Future distributions from the fund

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,520
need to grow at the same rate as the inflation

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,480
to guarantee their purchasing power.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,330
In year one, for example, distribution

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,510
should equal to c times 1 plus i.

17
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,340
More generally, in the year t, distribution amount would equal

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,790
c times 1 plus i raised to the power of t.

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,700
For example, in the year two, distribution amount

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,480
would be c times 1 plus i raised to the power of 2.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,580


22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,720
Let's put these distributions on the timeline.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,210
For comparison, let's also draw a stream

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:20,520
of payments that represent a regular growing perpetuity.

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,300
Notice that the two streams look alike with one difference.

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,390
For regular perpetuity, the first payment in year one

27
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,190
is c and the second payment in year two is c times 1

28
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,780
plus g, where g is the growth rate.

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,090
In our case, however, the first payment

30
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,660
is c times 1 plus i and the second payment

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,690
is c times 1 plus i squared.

32
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,610
Now, mathematically, we can make our stream of payments

33
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,120
look like a regular perpetuity if we

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,360
factor 1 plus the rate of inflation term out.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,610
To see this, let's write down the present value

36
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,040
of our stream, which is present value

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,789
equals to c times 1 plus i divided

38
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:16,610
by 1 plus r plus c multiplied by 1 plus i squared divided by 1

39
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,100
plus r squared and so forth.

40
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,880
Factoring 1 plus i out gives us the following expression--

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,290
present value equals to 1 plus i multiplied

42
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,260
by c divided by 1 plus r plus c multiplied by 1

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,220
plus i divided by 1 plus r squared, and so forth.

44
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,710
The expression inside large brackets

45
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,680
looks just like a regular perpetuity.

46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,340
Hence, its present value is just c divided by r minus i.

47
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,440
And therefore, the present value of our stream

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,150
is 1 plus i multiplied by c divided by r minus i.

49
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,700


50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,150
All that's left here is to find c in this expression.

51
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,150
Remember that we are given the present value, which

52
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,700
is the amount that Jeff Bezos pledged

53
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,480
to the foundation, which is $10 billion.

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,020
Given the interest rate of 8%, we

55
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,840
can solve this equation for payment amount c.

56
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,340
$10 equals to 1 plus 2%, which is the rate of inflation,

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,270
multiplied by c divided by 8%, which

58
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,490
is our interest rate, minus 2%, which is the rate of inflation.

59
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,920
Rearranging, this gives us c equals to $10 times

60
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,990
8% minus 2% divided by 1 plus 2%.

61
00:03:47,990 --> 00:04:00,660
This equals to $588,235,294 or roughly $588.2 million.

62
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,770
Note that the value of $588 million

63
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,520
that we found in this question is significantly lower

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,500
than the cost and distribution value

65
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,790
that we found in part a which was $800 million.

66
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,060
Intuitively, since we have to adjust for inflation,

67
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,570
we have to start paying a lower amount

68
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,020
so that we have enough funds to guarantee

69
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,260
all the future payments and adjustments for inflation.
