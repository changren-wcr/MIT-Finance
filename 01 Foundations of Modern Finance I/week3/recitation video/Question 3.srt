1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,920
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,820
learn how to find present value of growing annuity.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,975
Now is Year 0.

4
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:09,000
A biotechnology company has developed

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,210
a new nanorobotic surgical device.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,690
The patent on the device will last 15 years.

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,110
You expect that the profit from the device will be $5 million

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,340
in Year 1.

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,460
From Year 1 until Year 15, annual profit

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,860
is expected to grow at a rate of 4% per year.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,170
After patent expires, the emergence of new devices

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,930
and competition with other biotech firms

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,960
will drive profits from this surgical device to zero.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,300
The question asks us, what is the present value

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,530
of the new device if the discount rate is 9% per year?

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,270
Let's first use brute-force to find

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,650
the present value of profits generated by this device.

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,030
As the question states, in Year 1,

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,270
this device generates $5 million in profits.

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:07,070
From that point onwards, these profits grow at a 4% rate.

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,570
So in a Year 2, the profit generated by this device

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:17,350
will be $5 million multiplied by 1 plus the growth rate of 4%.

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,930
And this growth will continue all the way to Year 15.

24
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,280
So in Year 15, the device generates

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,660
$8,658,382 in profits.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,550
Now, what I will do in the next column,

27
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,620
I will discount each of these cash flows

28
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,660
individually to present.

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,700
So the present value of the first cash flow

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:47,720
will be $5 million divided by 1 plus the discount rate of 9%,

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,430
raised to the power 1.

32
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,980
This is the year when this cash flow occurs.

33
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,090
And we'll continue doing so all the way to Year 15.

34
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,080
For example, in Year 15 the present value

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,050
of the profit that occurs in Year 15

36
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,210
would be this value divided by 1 plus discount rate of 9%,

37
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,590
raised to the power of 15.

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,340
Now what's left is to add them up.

39
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,880
So the sum of these discount values

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,970
would represent the total present value

41
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,990
of all profits generated by this nanorobotic device.

42
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,230
Now let's do something smarter.

43
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,140
Notice that the stream of cash flows

44
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,930
that we have in this question represents a growing annuity.

45
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,500
Each payment growth has a growth rate of g equals to 4%.

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,960
The discount rate is 9%.

47
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,890
And the number of periods over which will get cash flow

48
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,735
is 15 years.

49
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:54,360
So therefore, to find the present value

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,818
of the stream of cash flows, we can

51
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:59,067
use growing annuity formula.

52
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,900
So the present value of this growing annuity

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,900
would be the first payment, which is $5 million,

54
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,140
divided by discount rate, 9%, minus growth rate,

55
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,820
4%, multiplied by 1 minus 1 plus g,

56
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,400
which is 4%, raised to the power of 15--

57
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,620
this is the total number of periods over which we'll

58
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,510
receive the cash flow--

59
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,540
divided by 1 plus discount rate, 9%,

60
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,560
raised again to the power 15.

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,580
So this value, if we compute it, will equal to $50,557,250

62
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,790
exactly the same value that we obtained

63
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,100
by applying the brute-force.

64
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,920
Overall, it is much more efficient to find

65
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,830
the present value of this stream of cash flows

66
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,080
by using the growing annuity formula

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,280
instead of discounting each of the individual cash flows

68
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,720
by hand.

69
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,350
And therefore, this should be our preferred approach

70
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,230
going forward.
