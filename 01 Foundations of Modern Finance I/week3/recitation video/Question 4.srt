PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,995
learn how to work with regular and delayed perpetuity.

2
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:08,840
Suppose that you are chief financial officer

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,210
of a company that owns a commercial real estate

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,950
property that is currently unused and is unoccupied.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,770
Assuming that the appropriate discount rate is 7%,

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,260
you would like to estimate the value of this property

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,110
under the following two assumptions.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,210
A, you can start renting it out immediately.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,560
You expect the annual rental profit to be $650,000

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,410
and to continue in perpetuity.

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,635
The first payment will occur in year one.

12
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:44,660
B, you will spend the first four years

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,030
redeveloping this property.

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,740
The present value of redevelopment costs

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,380
is $1 million.

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,470
Starting in year five, you will receive annual rental profit

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,730
of $950,000 which will continue in perpetuity.

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,350


19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,920
What is the value of the property under scenarios A

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,110
and B?

21
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,850
Let's start our analysis by looking at scenario A.

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,260
If we rent out our property immediately,

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,640
we will receive $650,000 in year one.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,970
This profit will continue being generated every year

25
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,250
in perpetuity.

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,160
So therefore, this stream of cash flows

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,910
represents a regular perpetuity.

28
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,800
The first payment starts in year one and it continues forever.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,590
Therefore, we can find the present value

30
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,640
of this perpetual stream of cash flows

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,890
by taking the first payment that we receive of $650,000

32
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,720
and just dividing it by the discount rate, in our case,

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,730
it is 7%.

34
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:03,720
So the present value of this rental profit is $9,285,714.

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,500
So therefore, this property will generate exactly that much

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,000
throughout its perpetual lifetime.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,120
Now, let's turn to the analysis of scenario

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480
B. In this scenario, we develop the property

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,120
during the first four years.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,990
It starts generating a profit of $950,000 in year five,

41
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,330
and this profit will be generated every year thereafter

42
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,510
forever.

43
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,200
We call this stream of cash flows a delayed perpetuity.

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,950
It is similar to regular perpetuity

45
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,240
with the only difference that the first cash flow starts not

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,430
in year one, but later.

47
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,880
In our case, it starts in year five.

48
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,050
To find the present value of the delayed perpetuity,

49
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,420
let's follow an approach we developed in question two.

50
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,030
Let's draw a timeline, a new timeline,

51
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,840
by denoting the first year in which we receive payment

52
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,260
by year one.

53
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,930
In this case, year five in the actual timeline

54
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,380
is year one in the new timeline.

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,050
In this new timeline, the stream of payments

56
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,570
looks like a regular perpetuity.

57
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,390
And we can find its present value.

58
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:31,260
It equals to $950,000 divided by 7% which is $13,571,429.

59
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,570
Importantly, note that in the actual timeline,

60
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,550
this value is in the year four, not in year zero.

61
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,570
To find its present value, we need to discount it further

62
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,190
by dividing it by one plus 7% raise to the power of four.

63
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,520
Therefore, the present value of this delayed perpetuity

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:04,670
is $10,353,578.

65
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,760
Overall, what we've found so far is that this property

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:16,220
generates $10,353,578.

67
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,829
Taking into account the present value of redevelopment costs,

68
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,810
which are $1 million, the value of the property

69
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:33,380
under this scenario is $9,353,578.

70
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,670
Recall that if we choose scenario A,

71
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,450
the present value of the property

72
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:49,190
is $9,285,714 which is less than what we got under scenario B.

73
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,140
The conclusion is that we should redevelop

74
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,200
this property because this would generate higher

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,500
wealth as indicated by the larger present value.

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,000
