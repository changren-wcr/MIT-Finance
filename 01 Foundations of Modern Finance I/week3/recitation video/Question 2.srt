1
00:00:00,265 --> 00:00:02,640
PROFESSOR: Suppose that you have an outstanding loan that

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,270
requires ten annual payments of $2,300.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,030
Now is Year Zero, and the next payment on the loan

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,970
is due in Year 6.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,810
The last payment is due in Year 15.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,460
There is a bank account that offers 5% annual interest rate.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,210
You would like to make a deposit into this account today, which

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,990
would allow you to repay this loan.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,720
What is the amount that you need to deposit?

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,690
This question is similar to question 1

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,200
because we have the same annual payment, the same interest

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,040
rate.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,660
The only difference is that our payments start in Year 6

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,260
and end in Year 15.

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,450
So let's first find the present value of these payments

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,040
by using brute-force.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,240
So I'll start discounting each of these individual payments,

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,060
similar to what we did in question 1,

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,950
by taking the payment and dividing it

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,660
by 1 plus the discount rate.

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,910
And I will raise it to the power,

22
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,820
which equals to the year in which this payment occurs.

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,860


24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,080
We'll extend this array.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,530
This would give me the present value of each

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,260
of these individual payments.

27
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,880
And I will add them up.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,380
And this will give me the present value

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:37,670
of all of these payments, which would equal to $13,915.42.

30
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,700
Now, let's do something smarter.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,010
First, I will relabel the timeline

32
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,370
but ignoring the first year in which we receive payment

33
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,650
by Year 1.

34
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,130
In this case, Year 6 in the actual timeline,

35
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,640
is Year 1 in the new timeline.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,220
In this new timeline, the stream of payments

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,440
looks like a regular annuity, and we

38
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,570
can find its present value.

39
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,080
In fact, we already found it in question 1.

40
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,270
It equals to $17,760.

41
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,960
But in the old timeline, this is the value

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,270
in Year 5, not present value.

43
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,790
To find its present value, what we need to do,

44
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,370
we need to discount it by dividing it

45
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:32,370
by 1 plus our interest rate, 5%, raised to the power of 5.

46
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,650
By doing so, we get $13,915.42.

47
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,960
This is exactly the same answer as we

48
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,980
obtained by discounting each payment manually.

49
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,560
The stream of cash flows we started in this question

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,980
represents a delayed annuity.

51
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,040
Now, let's summarize what we learned in this question.

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,250
If we need to find a present value of a delayed annuity that

53
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,580
starts paying in Year N, we need to do the following.

54
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,260
First, we use the annuity formula to find its value

55
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,855
in Year N minus 1.

56
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:17,040
And second, we discount Year N minus 1 value to present.
