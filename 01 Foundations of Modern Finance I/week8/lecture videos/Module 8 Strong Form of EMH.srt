1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,660
PROFESSOR: We now examine the strong form

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,430
of market efficiency.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,730
This is the most extreme form of the hypothesis.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,210
And it states that no information

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,410
can be used to achieve abnormal investment performance, not

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,250
even private information.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,590
Most academics and practitioners believe

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,430
that this strong form of market hypothesis

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,160
does not hold in the data.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,710
Markets are not strong-form efficient.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,870
Private information could be used

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,240
to achieve abnormal returns.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,060
We're going to look at some academic studies that

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,540
examine performance of insiders and find

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,610
evidence of superior returns based on private information.

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,310
We should know that in most developed countries,

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,970
trading on insider information is illegal.

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,540
In the US, legislation from 1934,

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,960
the Act of the US Securities and Exchange Commission,

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,230
rules against insider trading.

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,460
Trading by firm insiders based on private or privileged

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,100
information is prohibited.

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,800
There are also constraints on the investment banks

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,440
that separate investment banking from sales

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,430
and trading and research for the same purpose.

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,560
It is well understood that trading

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,300
on private or inside information is toxic to the market.

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,370
It erodes market liquidity.

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,800
And therefore, various legal safeguards

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,940
are put in place to limit this type of activity.

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,510
We do not rely on the markets to fully reflect

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,810
inside information in prices.

33
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,840
The following table, based on a 1992 study

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
in the Journal of Finance, examines

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,220
performance of insider traders.

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,530
The data here comes from the criminal cases

37
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,320
where insider trading has been documented.

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,780
And therefore, we know exactly when

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,810
insiders were trading on privileged information, what

40
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,480
types of announcements they were using,

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,960
and what kind of performance they were able to achieve.

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,510
The most common example is trading

43
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,760
on the takeover-related information.

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,140
What we see is that abnormal performance of insiders

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,410
is highly economically significant and statistically

46
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,540
significant.

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,730
Average cumulative of normal return

48
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,720
following a takeover-related news is close to 30%.

49
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,470
This is also confirmed what most academics and practitioners

50
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,210
believe, that trading on inside information can be profitable

51
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,550
and that markets are not strong-form efficient.

52
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,570
This is the reason why insider trading is heavily regulated,

53
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,210
and various legal restrictions are

54
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,660
placed trying to prevent this type of activity

55
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,770
in financial markets.

56
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,550
Another way of looking at insider trading,

57
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,220
rather than examining individual cases,

58
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,190
is to look at the average price behavior

59
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,260
around the announcements.

60
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,440
The following study from 1981 looks

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,450
at the price behavior and trading

62
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,400
volume around the takeover announcements.

63
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,220
What we see here is intriguing.

64
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,740
Following the announcement, on average,

65
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,940
there is no price drift up or down,

66
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,840
which would seem to be consistent with the semi-strong

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
form of market efficiency.

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,790
What is puzzling here is that prior to the announcement,

69
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,260
there seems to be a clear pattern in the price behavior.

70
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,600
The price of the target stock tends

71
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,850
to rise in the days preceding the news.

72
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,790
It is difficult to explain this kind of pattern

73
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,280
other than by appealing to the fact

74
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,910
that some of the traders with privileged information

75
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,480
are trading before the news, and their trades

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,880
are getting impacted into prices.

77
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,910
And they're moving the price of the target firm.

78
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,030
On average, roughly half of the price increase

79
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,210
that occurs as a result of a takeover announcement

80
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,630
happens in the days preceding the announcement, which

81
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,200
is strong evidence for some kind of insider trading ahead

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,630
of the announcement.

83
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,120
We might not know who exactly is trading ahead

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,320
of the announcement.

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,690
These are not the firm insiders who

86
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,920
would have to file a note with the SEC following their trades,

87
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,140
revealing their trading activity.

88
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,870
But it does appear that some third parties

89
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,660
with the sensitive information about the takeover

90
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,130
are trading ahead of the announcement.
