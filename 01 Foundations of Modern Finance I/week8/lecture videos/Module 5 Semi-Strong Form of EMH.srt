1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,020
PROFESSOR: We now consider the semi-strong form

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,910
of market efficiency.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,880
Under the semi-strong form of efficiency,

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,390
all public information should be fully reflected in prices,

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,370
and it should be impossible to achieve

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,640
abnormal risk adjusted returns by trading

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,450
on public information.

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,410
This implies in particular that fundamental analysis should not

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,790
be useful for achieving abnormal investment performance.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,240
Now, the purpose of fundamental analysis

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,410
is to exploit opportunities when some public information

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,430
about firms is not reflected in prices immediately.

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,220
If markets are semi-strong-form efficient,

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,240
fundamental analysis is not going to achieve that goal.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,100
Information included under the semi-strong form of market

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,700
efficiency is going to contain things like firm

17
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,140
financial statements, any types of corporate announcements,

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,010
such as news about earnings, dividends, share repurchases,

19
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,050
debt issue, stock splits, and so forth,

20
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,880
as well as mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers.

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,910
None of these types of announcements,

22
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,520
none of these sources of public information,

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,550
should be useful for generating abnormal investment

24
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,260
performance.

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,210
Let's examine how prices should respond to information

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,080
under the semi-strong form of market efficiency.

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,460
When the news arrives, there are three possible patterns.

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,310
The price may react to the news immediately

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,420
with no further adjustment.

30
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,050
This is the blue line on the graph.

31
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,620
We may see delayed reaction, which is the dotted line, so

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,560
that information gets priced in eventually,

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,390
but not immediately.

34
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,170
Or we may see overreaction, where the price moves

35
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,650
too much in response to an information release,

36
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,960
and then it recovers back to the appropriate level.

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,420
Under the semi-strong form of market efficiency,

38
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,139
price action to news should be immediate.

39
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,490
And we should not see any underreaction or overreaction.

40
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,860
There should be no predictability in returns

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,040
following the announcement.

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,800
In other words, the blue line in the graph

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,990
represents the average pattern of price response to the news.

44
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,090
As we examine empirical evidence,

45
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,340
we are going to look for evidence in favor

46
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,960
or against this type of price response to information.

47
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,870
An important tool used to analyze

48
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,470
semi-strong form of market efficiency is event studies.

49
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,960
The objective of event studies is

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,210
to examine if for specific information is incorporated

51
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:57,350
into the price in a single jump once information is released.

52
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,470
Let's discuss the design of the event

53
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,770
studies, which is a commonly used statistical setting.

54
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,560
And it's applied broadly, not just

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,480
for the purposes of analyzing market efficiency.

56
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,320
The idea is to pull together various observations

57
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,970
and to connect them in time, so that day zero

58
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,380
corresponds to the date at which information is released.

59
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,180
The actual events, of course, are

60
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,060
going to occur to various firms at different points

61
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,820
in physical time.

62
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,290
We then calculate daily returns during a window,

63
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,340
let's say a 30-days window, around the announcement date,

64
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,340
around day zero.

65
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,730
We'll look 30 days prior to the announcement and 30 days

66
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,320
following the announcement.

67
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,300
We then define the comparison group.

68
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,690
For example, we could look at the market portfolio

69
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,500
or the industry portfolio or a portfolio of similar firms

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,690
as a comparison group.

71
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,700
And we compute returns on the comparison group

72
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,400
on the same days.

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,280
We denote the return on the market

74
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,800
or a different kind of comparison group

75
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,980
as Rm sub t for each day t.

76
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,649
Next, we define the abnormal return.

77
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,110
The abnormal return is the difference

78
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,260
between the return on the stock on day t

79
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,730
and the return on its comparison group,

80
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,020
which is supposed to have the same risk profile.

81
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,300
The abnormal return AR on stock i at day t

82
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,260
is the difference R sub it minus Rmt.

83
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,170
In other words, it's the return of the stock

84
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,970
minus the benchmark or the comparison group return.

85
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,750
Once we define the abnormal daily returns on the stock,

86
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,630
we calculate the average abnormal return

87
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,030
over all of the events.

88
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,960
This is defined for each day in our window, 30 days prior

89
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,160
to the announcement to 30 days following the announcement.

90
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,520
Finally, we define the cumulative abnormal return,

91
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,030
starting from 30 days prior to the announcement and all

92
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,780
the way to the end of the window, 30 days afterwards.

93
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,060
And the cumulative abnormal return

94
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,470
is computed by simply adding up abnormal returns

95
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,940
on consecutive days.

96
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,920
This cumulative abnormal return is our object of analysis.

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,740
Under the semi-strong form of market efficiency,

98
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,310
we should not see on average a positive cumulative abnormal

99
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:37,810
return.

100
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,400


101
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,500
If you look at the following graph,

102
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,560
we see, again, an illustration of how

103
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,960
the cumulative average abnormal return should

104
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,740
look under the efficient reaction

105
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,680
to information, on the underreaction and overreaction.

106
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,170
Following the efficient reaction to information,

107
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,400
we should see an immediate jump on announcement, on day zero,

108
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,520
with no clear pattern up or down following the announcement.

109
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,680
If on the other hand, the market underreacts to information,

110
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,150
we should see that the immediate response is relatively muted,

111
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,600
and there is a pattern of predictability

112
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,480
with the upward drift in prices following the announcement.

113
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,700
If the market overreacts, we are going

114
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,250
to see a very large immediate response

115
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,830
and then mean reversion afterwards.

116
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,150
It is clear that under the efficient reaction

117
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,050
to information, we will not be able to generate

118
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,380
abnormal profits by trading on public information

119
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,370
after the announcement.

120
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,580
If the market under or over reacts to information,

121
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,160
then such strategies will be possible.

122
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,440
If the market underreacts, buying

123
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,820
following the announcement should

124
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,100
lead to abnormal profits.

125
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,020
If the market overreacts, we want

126
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,730
to sell following the announcement.

127
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,470
And that, again, would lead to abnormal profits.
