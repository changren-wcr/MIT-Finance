1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,520
PROFESSOR: We now looked at various types of information

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,460
related to the weak, semi-strong,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,250
and the strong form of market efficiency.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,830
The conclusion is that markets appear

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,310
to be fairly efficient in a weak sense.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,890
It is difficult to achieve abnormal performance

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,950
using historical information on prices.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,170
Markets also pretty close to being

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,240
semi-strong form efficient.

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,220
It is hard to achieve abnormal performance

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,830
based on public information.

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,940
But there is evidence that private, inside information

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,030
could be used to achieve abnormal performance.

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,900
Let's discuss a few questions related to these observations.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,280
One central question is, how exactly does information

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,920
get into prices?

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,290
Our example of the Challenger crash gives us a clue.

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,280
Prices reflect information because various traders

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,670
act on the information that they have.

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,790
Markets don't happen to be efficient on their own.

21
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,240
They become efficient as a result of the trading activity,

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,120
as a result of various market participants

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,940
pursuing profitable trading opportunities.

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,540
By doing that, they help make prices efficient.

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,490
They impound the information into the prices.

26
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,940
Having said that, if prices end up

27
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,340
reflecting all available information,

28
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,820
who has the incentive to collect information in the first place

29
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,980
if information gathering is costly?

30
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,500
This creates a bit of a paradox.

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,130
In order for the markets to be informational efficient,

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,850
someone needs to collect information and trade on it.

33
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,540
Yet, if markets are as efficient as we say,

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,710
there is no incentive to collect information and curb the cost.

35
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,380
This suggests a relatively nuanced view

36
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,740
of market efficiency.

37
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,070
Markets don't happen to be perfectly efficient.

38
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,010
What we see is a process by which markets

39
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,110
are moving towards efficiency.

40
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,090
This process, however, relies on a constant information

41
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,600
gathering and trading by market participants.

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,140
They need to be incentivized to do that, which means that there

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,100
has to be some room for achieving profitable investment

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,400
performance by investing information, gathering,

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,470
and processing.

46
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,670
What has to be the case, however,

47
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,260
is that after accounting for the costs of gathering information,

48
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,140
there is no remaining room for abnormal performance

49
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,450
as a result of intense competition

50
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,770
between various traders.

51
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,700
In other words, one cannot expect to achieve abnormal

52
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,660
performance for free by looking at the easily available pieces

53
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,430
of information.

54
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,570
There may, however, be room for beating benchmarks,

55
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,050
beating indices on a risk adjusted basis

56
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,130
by the amount that reflects the amount of resources expended

57
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,800
on collecting and processing information.

58
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,080
A few practical issues about the efficient markets hypothesis

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,230
remain.

60
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,050
One is misidentification.

61
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,810
Perhaps the reason why we see some evidence

62
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,610
of abnormal performance is that we have missing risk factors.

63
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,400
Our risk adjustment is not perfect.

64
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,350
The possibility that some risk factors

65
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,093
are missing from our risk model is always present.

66
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:32,510
And this is something that we have

67
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,990
to keep in mind when we examine evidence on performance

68
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,660
of various trading strategies.

69
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,210
A related issue is time variation

70
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,010
in risk loadings and risk premia.

71
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,830
As we identify normal and abnormal returns,

72
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,140
we have to keep in mind that risk and risk

73
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,300
premium may be time varying.

74
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,780
And using risk models with constant risk premia

75
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,270
with constant risk loadings can lead

76
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,820
to misidentification of what we call

77
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,480
normal or risk-based returns.

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,630
There is a host of other issues that we can broadly describe

79
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,880
as market imperfections.

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,209
When we examine performance of trading strategies using

81
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,850
historical back tests, we have to worry

82
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,320
about frictions like transaction costs, liquidity, taxes,

83
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,490
price impact, and so forth.

84
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,450
In other words, when we look at the historical performance

85
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,580
of trading strategies on paper, we

86
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,560
have to keep in mind that these may not

87
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,150
translate one-to-one to the actual investment performance

88
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,540
in real market scenarios.

89
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,975
Finally, we want to address the issue of micro

90
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:47,600
versus macro efficiency.

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,120
Our argument for market efficiency

92
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,150
has to do with absence of arbitrage.

93
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,480
It has to do with the fact that in a competitive market,

94
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,750
investors pursue profitable trading opportunities,

95
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,110
and they eliminate mispricing as a result.

96
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,920
This argument works best at the micro level.

97
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,060
When we compare one stock to another with similar risk

98
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,090
exposures, or one derivative security to another

99
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,260
or to the underlying asset, we can expect arbitrage activity

100
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,890
to eliminate mispricing.

101
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,580
This argument is a lot harder to make

102
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,250
at the level of broad asset classes, at the macro level.

103
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,210
As a result, market efficiency as a concept

104
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,780
has most clear implications for the micro efficiency,

105
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,020
for the relative pricing of individual assets.

106
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,530
It is a lot harder to think about abnormal performance

107
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,750
at the level of broad asset classes,

108
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,180
like equities and bonds, real estate, and so forth.

109
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,290
The main lessons from the efficient market hypothesis

110
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,650
are the following.

111
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,450
We contrast market prices.

112
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,870
When we buy and sell financial assets at the market prices,

113
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,630
we achieve zero net present value.

114
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,700
Market prices are fair.

115
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,520
We neither make abnormal returns,

116
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,600
nor do we lose money when we trade at market prices.

117
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,850
This has important implications in corporate finance

118
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,580
in capital budgeting.

119
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,380
Market efficiency implies that market prices provide the best

120
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,590
estimate of the economic value of projects,

121
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,710
and that we should use the net present value, the market

122
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,220
value of the investment projects, as our guide

123
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,620
for investment decisions.

124
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,330
Firms should also expect to gain fair value for the securities

125
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,350
that they issue.

126
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,280
When they finance projects by issuing debt and equity,

127
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,370
they would expect investors to pay the fair price

128
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,120
because, on average, assets that trade in the financial market

129
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,960
are neither overvalued or undervalued.

130
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,370
Market efficiency also means that we can read into prices.

131
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,120
You could use financial prices to extract information

132
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,955
about fundamentals.

133
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:12,330
And this is something that can be

134
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,730
definitely useful for forecasting

135
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,700
and economic policy.

136
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,590
Another lesson from market efficiency

137
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,140
is that there are no financial illusions.

138
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,900
Market prices reflect fundamental information

139
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,610
properly.

140
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,860
This means that the market value of the firm,

141
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,080
the market the value of an asset, is based on its payoff.

142
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,870
It is not easy to trick the market, for instance,

143
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,530
by playing with accounting data.

144
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,400


145
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,580
The last conclusion, the last lesson from market efficiency,

146
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,540
is that one needs to have some kind of economic edge

147
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,750
in order to generate a positive NPV.

148
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,930
Otherwise, if you trade in the financial markets,

149
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,270
every transaction is a fair transaction.

150
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,850
It has zero net present value.

151
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,380
In order to create the project which

152
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,730
adds value, which has a positive net present value,

153
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,380
we need to either have superior information,

154
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,840
or superior technology, or access

155
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,350
to cheap resources, some kind of competitive advantage

156
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,560
or economic edge that translates into a positive net present

157
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,670
value.

158
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,640
We cannot simply add value by buying and selling financial

159
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,790
securities.
