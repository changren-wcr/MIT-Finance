1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,810
We now examine the weak form of the Efficient Markets

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,370
Hypothesis.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,100
Empirical tests of the weak form look

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,800
at various patterns in returns, patterns,

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,720
such as serial correlation in returns or performance

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,880
of filter rules or performance of technical analysis.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,790
Let's begin with the serial correlation.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,360
If past prices could be used to predict future returns,

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,390
we would be able to detect a correlation between price

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,680
changes and success of future returns.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,960
In other words, we would be able to see

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,360
statistical correlation between past returns

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,860
and future returns.

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,230
This is known as serial correlation.

15
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,180
Would high degree of serial correlation

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,540
be inconsistent with the efficient markets hypothesis?

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,110
Or could it be explained by a risk model?

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,530
The challenge when trying to explain serial correlation

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,630
with the risk model is that one would

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,870
need to argue that the conditional risk of an asset

21
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,040
changes rapidly over time in relation to past returns.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,080
Most common risk models do not have

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,770
that property, at least not at the high frequency,

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,030
such as daily.

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,850
In the following graph, we see an illustration.

26
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,090
We look at daily returns on two stocks.

27
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,310
One is Philips Electronics.

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,900
The other one is Sony.

29
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,970
These are both scatter plots.

30
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,960
On the horizontal axis, we plot daily returns on day T

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,480
and on the vertical axis daily returns

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,370
on the consecutive trading day, t plus 1.

33
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,320
Both of these scatter plots reveal no obvious pattern.

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,480
They look like a ball of points.

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,460
This is the point here.

36
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,730
There is no pattern of serial correlation

37
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,970
in the daily returns of these stocks.

38
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,880
As we estimate the serial correlation statistically,

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,150
we see that it is very close and indistinguishable from 0.

40
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,200
This type of pattern is typical.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,710
For most individual stocks, serial correlation of returns

42
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,510
is very close to 0.

43
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,030
In a well-known study in 1965, Eugene Fama

44
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,700
analyzed patterns of serial correlation

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,440
across various stocks.

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,410
And he found that the horizons of 1, 4, 9,

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,160
16 days, evidence for serial correlation

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,110
is essentially absent.

49
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,830
On average, serial correlation among consecutive stock returns

50
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,160
is very close to 0 across stocks.

51
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,500
The same can be said about index returns, or portfolio returns.

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,160
The following graph illustrates lack of serial correlation

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,650
for the S&P 500 Index.

54
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,230
Looking at the 10-year daily sample,

55
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,950
we see that the relation between daily returns

56
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,940
on consecutive trading days reveals no obvious pattern

57
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,790
of serial correlation.

58
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,660
There are other statistical patterns that one can explore,

59
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,100
which are related to the weak form of market efficiency.

60
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,360
Two famous results are on momentum and reversal

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,830
in returns.

62
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,860
In a 1993 paper, Jegadeesh and Titman

63
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,980
documented presence of medium-horizon momentum

64
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,500
in asset returns.

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,790
What they did is they sorted stocks on their past returns

66
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,270
over, say, a 6-month interval and then

67
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,730
documented the average performance

68
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,840
over the following 6-month period.

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,530
They found that the past winners tend to outperform over

70
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,360
the following period.

71
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,830
The past losers tend to underperform.

72
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,490
This phenomenon is known as momentum.

73
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,370
Strong returns tend to continue, and weak returns

74
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,450
tend to continue at certain horizons of several months.

75
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,970
Hong, Lim, and Stein found that momentum

76
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,810
is particularly strong among small stocks with low analyst

77
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,460
coverage.

78
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,200
A different pattern, called long-term reversal,

79
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,310
was documented by De Bondt and Thaler in a 1985 paper.

80
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,540
They found evidence that losers over longer horizons,

81
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,029
let's say 36 months, subsequently

82
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,940
outperform over the horizon of 36 months.

83
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,890
It's the opposite for the winners.

84
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,070
Past winners tend to underperform over

85
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,520
a similar horizon.

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,030
The following graph shows some empirical evidence

87
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,090
for the historical performance of the past winners

88
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,250
versus past losers.

89
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,320
What we see is a clear difference

90
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,960
in the average returns.

91
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,600
The winner portfolio outperforming

92
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
the loser portfolio.

93
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,590
As we look at the historical performance of the momentum

94
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,410
and the reversal strategies, the question that arises

95
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,560
is, do these pose a challenge to the weak form

96
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,260
of efficient markets hypothesis?

97
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,630
Can we explain differences in performance

98
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,770
between winners and losers by differences in risk?

99
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,060
This is a subject of an ongoing debate.

100
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,680
For example, is it the case that the past winners are more

101
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,990
risky than the past losers?

102
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,390
Is it the case that the long-term losers

103
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:28,100
in the reversal strategy become more risky as a result?

104
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,900
When we compute abnormal returns,

105
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,040
we need to know what the normal returns are, returns

106
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,150
justified by the risk exposure.

107
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,330
Part of the challenge with the momentum strategy in particular

108
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,620
is that membership in the winner and loser portfolios changes

109
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,200
over time.

110
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,710
Past winners don't stay in the winner portfolio for long.

111
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,350
The same is true for the past losers.

112
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,710
This means that if we wanted to explain momentum

113
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,750
based on risk exposures, we would

114
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,060
have to argue that the risk of stocks

115
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,490
changes at relatively high frequency over time.

116
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,930
Momentum strategies are also fairly well known.

117
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,930
And they are commonly used by investment managers.

118
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,910
The fact that their profitability does not

119
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,460
tend to disappear over time suggests

120
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,340
that these returns may not be purely abnormal

121
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,760
and may indicate some kind of risk exposure.

122
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,230
And that is the reason why they don't get arbitraged away.
