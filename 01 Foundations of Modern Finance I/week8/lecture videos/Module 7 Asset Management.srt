1
00:00:00,607 --> 00:00:02,940
PROFESSOR: The challenge in testing the semi-strong form

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,790
of market efficiency is that we can only

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,790
hope to find evidence against the hypothesis.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,330
To do that, we would have to find a trading strategy using

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,280
public information that achieves abnormal returns.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,410
We cannot examine all possible trading strategies of this

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,370
type.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,120
Therefore, there is always this lingering doubt

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,010
that perhaps we simply didn't look

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,990
at the right types of trading strategies,

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,990
and that is why we haven't identified abnormal returns.

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,430
There is an alternative strategy for testing the hypothesis.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,760
Instead of looking for particular trading strategies,

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,080
particular types of public information to predict returns,

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,220
we're going to look instead at asset management

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,060
and ask whether or not active asset managers are

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,100
able to achieve abnormal returns.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,880
The idea here is simple.

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,090
Active asset managers use fundamental analysis.

20
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,180
They use public information to try and achieve

21
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,590
abnormal performance relative to their risk-adjusted,

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,940
risk-matched benchmarks.

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,040
We're going to look for abnormal performance of such managers.

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,880
And if they are able to beat their benchmarks

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,040
on a risk-adjusted basis, we're going

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,890
to conclude that there is evidence

27
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,930
that some types of public information

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,660
is useful for generating abnormal performance.

29
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,710
We wouldn't know exactly which signals

30
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,190
these managers are using.

31
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,430
But we are going to see that somehow they're

32
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,450
able to use public information to achieve abnormal returns.

33
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,330
If, on the other hand, active managers are not

34
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,910
able to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis,

35
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,070
we're going to conclude that all sorts of public information

36
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,470
that these managers may be looking at

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,040
are not useful for achieving abnormal performance.

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,450
This is the idea.

39
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,440
Instead of looking for signals based on public information

40
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,740
ourselves, we're going to examine performance

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,470
of the active asset managers and see

42
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,860
if they are able to use public information to achieve

43
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,660
abnormal investment performance.

44
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,280
We're going to look at the active equity funds

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,870
and compare their performance to equity indices.

46
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,800
This is a somewhat crude way of adjusting for risk

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,440
by comparing a return on the mutual fund

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,160
to the broad market return.

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,990
We find that on average mutual funds

50
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:45,120
tend to underperform the market about 60%, 70% of the time.

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,390
One may argue that perhaps the appropriate way of doing a risk

52
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,390
adjustment is not to simply subtract the market

53
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,620
return from the fund return, but to estimate the risk

54
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,180
exposure of the fund and to risk adjust each fund based

55
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,940
on their particular risk exposure, which may not

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,450
be equivalent to the risk in the index.

57
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,110
This type of refinement does not change the conclusion.

58
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,130
The majority of the funds does not deliver abnormal returns

59
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,590
on the risk-adjusted basis.

60
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,470
This type of risk adjustment also

61
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,610
includes adjustment for expenses, asset management

62
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,440
fees.

63
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,860
Any type of abnormal performance that the managers may

64
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,890
be able to achieve by using public information

65
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,140
is erased by expenses.

66
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,720
At the end of the day, the professional investment

67
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,160
management doesn't seem to generate value for investors.

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,410
And any type of value added they seem

69
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,980
to be able to produce using public information

70
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,230
accrues to the managers themselves

71
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,440
and not to the investors.

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,490
The following table summarizes historical performance

73
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:02,350
of all equity funds grouped along a number of dimensions.

74
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,440
We can see that when we look across all domestic equity

75
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,370
funds or when we group them by style, by size,

76
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,760
and so forth, the pattern is very similar.

77
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,110
The majority of the funds underperforms their benchmarks,

78
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,360
particularly over longer periods of time.

79
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,730
The advantage of this type of analysis

80
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,580
is that instead of comparing all of the funds

81
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,780
to the broad market, we are comparing them to the benchmark

82
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,070
that the funds themselves state as relevant

83
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,230
for their investment style.

84
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,720
The hope is that this kind of comparison

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,540
captures their risk exposure of the funds relative closely.

86
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,370
Another way of looking at the evidence

87
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,070
is to ask whether there is any way

88
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,510
to predict which funds may outperform their benchmarks

89
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,360
or the market going forward.

90
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,610
Perhaps on average, funds do not deliver abnormal performance.

91
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,330
But could it be that some of them are able to do so?

92
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,850
And if we simply focus on the best funds,

93
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,510
we will see evidence of abnormal investment performance using

94
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,850
public information?

95
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,880
It turns out that it is very difficult

96
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,270
to identify or predict which managers are going

97
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,060
to outperform going forward.

98
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,020
In the following table, you see one type of analysis

99
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,840
that provides evidence of the lack of predictability

100
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,970
in investment performance.

101
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,250
This is a very simple approach.

102
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,630
We sort funds on their past performance

103
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,650
into five quintiles from the 20% of the worst performers

104
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,230
to the 20% of the best performers

105
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,030
and then examine how these funds do going forward.

106
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,310
What we see is that past performance does not

107
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,670
predict which funds will end up as future winners,

108
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,430
specifically which funds will be in the top quintile

109
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,720
by investment performance.

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,370
The only pattern we see is that poorly performing funds,

111
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,370
the funds in the bottom quintile of past performance,

112
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,480
are likely to perform somewhat poorly going forward.

113
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,250
And they're also more likely to end up closed

114
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,710
or to merge with another fund.

115
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,380
Because these mutual funds cannot be shorted,

116
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,950
such pattern of predictable poor performance cannot be used

117
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,890
by investors to generate abnormal positive returns.

118
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,700
One may argue that the reason why we do not see a pattern

119
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,510
of predictability in returns, why we cannot identify

120
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,840
the winner funds, the best managers,

121
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,830
is because our method of analysis is relatively crude.

122
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,920
Perhaps sorting funds on their past performance

123
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,730
is not the best way to find the best managers,

124
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,890
and there is a more sophisticated approach

125
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,580
that could reveal funds with a relatively high

126
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,310
positive abnormal performance.

127
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,910
One idea for addressing this type of challenge

128
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,830
is to look at the professional pension fund managers.

129
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,710
Instead of looking for the winning mutual fund managers

130
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,560
ourselves, we're going to look at the performance

131
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,600
of the pension fund managers, who

132
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,190
try to identify the best mutual fund managers for managing

133
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,800
their assets.

134
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Our discussion is based on the academic studies that

135
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,890
looked at the sample of pension fund managers

136
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:32,790
from 1994 to 2003 period and examined their hiring decisions

137
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,180
for mutual fund managers.

138
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,650
In the sample, we see over 8,000 hiring decisions

139
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,710
of 3,400 plan sponsors.

140
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,770
These are pension funds that allocate their capital

141
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,180
to professional money managers.

142
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,900
What we observe is that prior to the hiring decision,

143
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,710
performance of the fund managers is relatively good.

144
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,490
They outperform their benchmarks on the risk-adjusted basis

145
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,740
by several percentage points.

146
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,530
This is not surprising, because plan sponsors

147
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,552
use past performance of the fund as an input

148
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:10,385
into their decision.

149
00:08:10,385 --> 00:08:12,990


150
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,870
What we see after the hiring process

151
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,350
is that going forward these managers

152
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,280
tend to outperform their benchmark by approximately

153
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,710
64 basis points.

154
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,510
This is on the value weighted basis.

155
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,299
This amount of outperformance is consistent

156
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,090
with the typical level of management fees

157
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,570
that these funds charge.

158
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,990
In other words, following the hiring decision,

159
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,380
these managers do not deliver abnormal performance

160
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,820
after fees.

161
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,720
Any kind of outperformance they seem to be able to generate

162
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,510
is then consumed by the fees that they

163
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,850
charge to the plan sponsor.

164
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,580
In conclusion, what we see is that it is not

165
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,850
easy to find trading signals based

166
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,220
on the public information that would allow

167
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,930
us to forecast future returns.

168
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,840
While academic literature contains some examples

169
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,440
of the signals that seem to forecast returns,

170
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,120
one has to be careful interpreting

171
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,650
this kind of evidence.

172
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,820
It seems that while it may be possible to find

173
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,060
such signals in historical analysis,

174
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,120
we do not see evidence of abnormal live performance

175
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,930
of the professional managers.

176
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,530
The challenge of going from their academic results

177
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,300
from the back tests looking for abnormal patterns in returns

178
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,610
to the actual investment strategies

179
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,490
is that when we implement trading strategies,

180
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,340
we have to deal with a variety of frictions

181
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,820
that eat into performance--

182
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,730
