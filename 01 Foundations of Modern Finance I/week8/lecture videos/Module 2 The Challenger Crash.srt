1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,600
PROFESSOR: We will now discuss a particular example

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,450
that illustrates the notion of market efficiency very well.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,200
This is the Challenger crash.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,570
It happened in January of 1986.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,290
On the 28th of January at 11:39 AM,

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,080
the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,550
It was 73 seconds into its flight.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,670
Immediately, news outlets reported the event.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,880
Space Shuttle explodes, various contractors

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,990
who contributed to parts of the shuttle were asked to comment.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,210
They had no immediate comment.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,890
A presidential commission was formed

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,650
to investigate the causes of the crash.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,920
Famously, Richard Feynman, a well-known physicist

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,380
of the day, was on the commission.

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,400
The commission eventually concluded several months later

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,330
that the cause of the crash was the infamous O-ring.

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,770
In the report published on June 9th of 1986,

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,150
the commission found that this rubbery piece of insulation

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,760
failed due to low temperatures, which

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,930
led to fuel leak and, ultimately, the explosion.

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's take a look at the action in the financial markets

23
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,910
on the day of the crash.

24
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,510
We are now taking a close minute-by-minute look

25
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,580
at the price behavior.

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,950
What you see on the graph is a time series

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,100
of prices on several companies, which

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,380
were the important contractors contributing

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,900
elements of the shuttle.

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,790
In the first few minutes immediately

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,800
following the crash, all of these prices collapsed.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,360
At that point, the market did not

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,150
know which of the contractors was responsible.

34
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,820
But it was clear that someone will be at fault

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,590
and the news was bad.

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,650
A couple hours later, we see divergence.

37
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,920
All of the prices except for one start recovering.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,040
But one of the stocks does not recover by the end of the day.

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,900
This stock is the stock of Morton Thiokol, which

40
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,960
was the producer of the O-ring.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,410
How did the market know, almost immediately,

42
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,900
who was at fault when it took several months

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,780
for the presidential commission to figure it out?

44
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,890
The answer is that some of the engineers at Morton Thiokol

45
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,350
knew that there was a potential problem with their O-ring.

46
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,130
They tried to warn NASA about the danger,

47
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,960
but they were ignored, or overruled.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,740
The lesson here is that information that is available

49
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,930
to just a few can get impacted into prices relatively quickly.

50
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,810
This is how markets reach efficiency.

51
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,480
They're very good at aggregating useful pieces of information.
