1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,000
PROFESSOR: We now need to introduce a testable definition

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,490
of what it means for prices to fully reflect

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,360
all available information.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,370
According to our definition, a market

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,400
is efficient if it is impossible to make

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,710
excess profits by trading on all available information.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,600
Formally what that means is that the expected value

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,570
of the price plus the dividend next period

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,060
conditional on all available information,

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,540
which we denote by the information set J sub t,

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,260
is equal to the current price times the conditional expected

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,030
return on the asset.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,640
The exact form of market efficiency

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,180
depends on what exactly we include into the information

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:45,930
set.

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,780
What do we mean by all available information?

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,580
This is captured by J.

18
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,180
There are three important cases of market efficiency,

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,850
three forms.

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,150
The weak form specifies that all available information

21
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,019
means all of the information included in the past history

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,360
of security prices.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,210
For example, if the market is weak-form efficient,

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,440
it means that technical analysis,

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,010
which looks at the past history of prices,

26
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,540
cannot be used to achieve excess returns.

27
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,250
The next level of market efficiency

28
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,040
is what is called the semi-strong-form efficiency.

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,370
Under this notion, security prices

30
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,790
reflect all publicly available information.

31
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,130
This is not just information on prices,

32
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,680
but also information from other public sources.

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,740
Under the semi-strong form of market efficiency,

34
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,770
fundamental analysis that looks at various kinds

35
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,650
of fundamental data does not allow one

36
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,000
to achieve excess returns.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,820


38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,540
Finally, we get to the strong form of market efficiency.

39
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,740
As the name suggests, this is the strongest notion.

40
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,670
And according to the strong form,

41
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,520
all information is reflected in prices,

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,460
both public and private.

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,850
Under this hypothesis, inside information

44
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,400
available to the firm insiders does not

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,250
allow them to achieve superior performance or excess returns.

46
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,550


47
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,180
When we test the efficient market hypothesis empirically,

48
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,410
it is critical to differentiate excess or abnormal profits

49
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,200
from the risk premium.

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,190
This means that to make the efficient market hypothesis

51
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,810
usable, we need to take a stand on a particular risk model.

52
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,950
We need to identify what is the risk premium justified

53
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,440
by the risk exposures of the assets

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,660
and what part of their excess returns

55
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,420
is abnormal, which would be a violation

56
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,630
of the efficient markets hypothesis.

57
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,470
There are two common approaches of dealing with this challenge.

58
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,660
We could use a common set of risk models

59
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,930
to perform a risk adjustment and to identify

60
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,880
what part of returns is abnormal on a risk-adjusted basis.

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,040
The difficulty is that we do not have a well-accepted common set

62
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,480
of risk models.

63
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,610
And therefore, there is always a lingering doubt

64
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,940
that what we are seeing is not an abnormal performance,

65
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,440
but rather a failure to find the right risk model.

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,670
The second approach would be to find a profitable trading

67
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,720
strategy that would be very difficult to justify

68
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,450
by any risk model.

69
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,830
And we are going to look at some of the examples

70
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,600
of such strategies.

71
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,110
Obviously, testing the efficient market hypothesis

72
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,450
looks at the composite hypothesis,

73
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,570
the markets are efficient, and that our risk adjustment

74
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,588
is correct.

75
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:49,130
We're going to keep this in mind when

76
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,150
we examine empirical evidence.
