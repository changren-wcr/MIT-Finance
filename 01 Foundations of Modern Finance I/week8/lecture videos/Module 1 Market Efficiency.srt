00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,950
PROFESSOR: This week, we talk about market efficiency.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,810
Market efficiency is a very important topic,

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,260
which is somewhat subtle.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,650
Part of the challenge is that the notion of efficiency

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,440
is broadly used, and it has different meanings

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,300
in different contexts.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,030
In our discussion, in finance, efficiency

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,420
has a very particular, precise meaning,

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,710
which we are going to clarify.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,200
The general notion of economic efficiency

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,320
has to do with the allocation of limited resources.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,230
Are resources used in the most productive manner possible?

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,150
It is certainly an important question.

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,700
And a well-functioning financial system

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,060
plays a critical role in the allocation of resources.

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,700
This is not, however, how we think about efficiency

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,710
in financial markets.

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,190
Financial market efficiency is about how well market prices

19
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,340
aggregate information.

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,620
In an efficient market, prices fully

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,320
reflect all available information.

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,330
What we're going to do is clarify

23
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,989
what exactly it means for prices to fully reflect information.

24
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,980
We will also look at empirical evidence in favor

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,450
or against the efficient markets hypothesis.

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,660
Why would we expect markets to be efficient?

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,050
The answer is, ultimately, because of arbitrage.

28
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,020
Financial markets are fiercely competitive.

29
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,650
Traders, by chasing profitable trading opportunities,

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,640
incorporate all useful information into prices.

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,430
As a result, prices fully reflect

32
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,900
all the relevant available information.

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,340
A common criticism that you would hear

34
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,190
is that, how can markets be efficient

35
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,510
when investors are human and humans make mistakes?

36
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,680
That is certainly true.

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,620
However, this criticism is misplaced.

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,720
Market efficiency does not require

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,170
most of the traders or investors to be

40
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,840
rational and well-informed.

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,130
What we need is just a few smart, well-financed agents

42
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,710
who are unconstrained, and they are

43
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,710
the ones who can spot and eliminate profitable trading

44
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,150
opportunities.

45
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,550
They eliminate inefficiencies.

46
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,860
In other words, market efficiency

47
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,700
is a theory of sharks who capture profitable trading

48
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,780
opportunities.

49
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,150
It is not a theory of how an average investor behaves.
