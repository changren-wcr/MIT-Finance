1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,280
PROFESSOR: Let's examine some empirical evidence

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,800
using the events study tool.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,260
We're going to look at a couple of different types

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,520
of corporate announcements.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,420
One is the takeover announcement.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,120
When the firm becomes a target of takeover,

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,280
it receives a takeover offer, which is typically

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,870
at a significant premium to the current price of the firm.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,090
Following the takeover announcement,

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,570
the price of the target firm jumps, but not all the way

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,950
to the offer price.

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,530
This does not necessarily create a profitable trading

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,940
opportunity.

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,610
The reason for that is that following

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,040
the news of the takeover offer, there

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,200
is still significant uncertainty about

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,570
whether or not the takeover is going to go through.

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,340
The question we want to address is

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,700
whether it is possible to generate abnormal trading

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,380
profits by buying the stock of the target firm following

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,710
the takeover news.

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,870
As we see in the following graph, when

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,960
we look at all of the firms following

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,140
the announcement of the takeover offer,

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,560
there is no obvious pattern in the stock price behavior

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,910
following the announcement.

27
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,480
The stock price jumps on the news

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,160
and remains flat on average over a 60-day period following

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,260
the announcement.

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,860
If we then look at all of the firms for which the takeover

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,950
eventually materializes, their price

32
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,060
tends to move higher over the 60-day window.

33
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,360
Of course, we cannot monetize this type of pattern,

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,810
because we don't know in advance which of the firms are going

35
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,970
to eventually complete the takeover.

36
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,420
If we look at the firms for which takeover does not

37
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,690
go through, the price of these firms

38
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,300
reverts to the pre-offer level.

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,750
Again, this is looking at the data

40
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,700
with the benefit of hindsight.

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,690
We don't know at day zero, which of the firms

42
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,199
are going to end up on the blue or the yellow lines.

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,080
What we see instead is the average pattern

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,000
across all of the firms.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,250
And when we look across all of the firms,

46
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,040
there is no predictable price reaction

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,110
following the announcement.

48
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,020
In other words, markets seem to respond

49
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,840
to the information about a takeover offer

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,970
in an efficient manner, as predicted

51
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,340
by the efficient markets hypothesis.

52
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,140
The response is immediate.

53
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,500
And there is no subsequent price drift.

54
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,670
Another type of news that we examine using a similar design

55
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,300
is the announcement of dividend omissions.

56
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,240
Typically, when the firm decides to omit a dividend,

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,230
that is perceived by the market as a piece of bad news.

58
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,100
Firms are highly reluctant to cut or omit dividends.

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,470
And they only do this when their business circumstances require

60
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,800
so.

61
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,890
In other words, the news of a dividend omission

62
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,495
is a bad news about the future prospects of the firm.

63
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:10,740
And in particular, it's a negative signal

64
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,240
about future cash flows.

65
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,030
What we see empirically is that the price

66
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,010
tends to drop on the announcement of the dividend

67
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,460
omission, which reflects the fact that this

68
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,980
is a piece of negative news about the future cash

69
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,230
flows of the firm.

70
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,490
And there is no clear pattern of price drift up or down

71
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,230
following the announcement.

72
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,620
Again, what we see is that price behavior around dividend

73
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,890
omissions is consistent with the semi-strong form of market

74
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,710
efficiency.

75
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,500
Price response to the announcement immediately,

76
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,440
and there is no room for achieving abnormal trading

77
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,470
profits by trading following the announcement.

78
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,590
Next, we'll look at the pattern, which

79
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,790
is known as the post-earnings announcement drift.

80
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,180
Our discussion is based on the paper by Bernard and Thomas

81
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,080
from 1989 that looked at the price behavior following

82
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,800
earnings announcements.

83
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,320
This pattern poses a bit of a challenge

84
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,480
to the semi-strong form of market efficiency.

85
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,269
If we sold stocks into portfolios

86
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,380
based on the magnitude of the surprise in their earnings

87
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,540
announcements-- in other words, if we

88
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,420
look at earnings announcements in relation

89
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,890
to analyst expectations, we find that the stocks for which

90
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,430
earnings announcements deliver the largest positive surprise

91
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,420
relative to expectations tend to jump on announcement,

92
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,130
which is what we would expect.

93
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,840
But then what is puzzling is that they

94
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,950
continue rising in value following the announcement.

95
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,110
If we look at the other side, if we

96
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,660
look at the stocks with the negative surprise,

97
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,610
we see the reverse pattern.

98
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,890
They fall in value on announcement

99
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,830
and then continue declining afterwards.

100
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,930
This pattern is puzzling.

101
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,780
And it is similar to the momentum pattern.

102
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,620
Companies that perform well during a recent window

103
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,460
continue performing abnormally well going forward.

104
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,340
And firms that perform relatively poorly,

105
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,870
looking back, continue underperforming going forward.

106
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,190
To explain this pattern using a risk-based model,

107
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,620
we would need to argue that the firms that

108
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,320
deliver a positive earnings surprise

109
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,410
have a relatively high level of risk going forward.

110
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,800
And this is what explains their relatively high performance.

111
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,690
The firms that have a negative earnings surprise

112
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,940
would need to have a relatively low level of risk, which

113
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,760
would explain why the average returns going forward

114
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,420
are relatively low.

115
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,820
It is fairly challenging to come up

116
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,730
with a plausible risk-based explanation

117
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,060
for the post-earnings announcement drift.

118
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,510
It is fair to say that there is no consensus on whether or not

119
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,250
this pattern is an anomaly or evidence of time varying risk

120
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,670
exposures of the firms.
