1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,850
PROFESSOR: In this example, we will conduct an event study

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,070
for dividend announcements.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,980
Consider the following for stocks.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,050
The first stock on December 13, 1996 declared a dividend

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,950
of $0.10 per share.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,720
Notice that the previous dividend they omitted.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,160
The second stock on November 4, 2003

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,300
declared an increase in dividend from $0.06 per share

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,750
the quarter before to $0.12 per share.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,000
The third company on December 18, 2013

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,810
declared a special dividend of $0.41 per share.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,360
And finally, the last company on February 19, 2015

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,870
initiated a dividend of $0.05 per share.

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,050
Here we have the other returns on these four stocks

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,340
around the time they made these dividends announcements.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,310
For each of the stocks, I highlighted the dates

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,120
when they made the corresponding announcement

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,220
in this orange color.

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,730
So this is first stock, for second stock, for third stock.

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,730
This is for the fourth stock.

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,100
We have returns on the stocks in column I.

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,510
We also have the returns on the markets

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,830
on the same dates in column J.

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,100
First, let me compute the abnormal return, which

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,230
I will define as the difference between the return on the stock

26
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,280
minus the market return.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,240
And I will call this column AR, which

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,800
stands for the abnormal return.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,360
So this is the return on the stock in excess of the market.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,990


31
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,250
Next, let us compute the average abnormal return

32
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,030
across these four stocks on the announcement date.

33
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,460
So what I will do is I will say average

34
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,830
of the abnormal returns for each of the stocks

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,020
on the announcement date.

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,640
So these two numbers, this is on the third stock.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,940
And this is on the fourth stock.

38
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,180
And so let's see what we get.

39
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,460
So on average, the announcement at the return was 3.5%.

40
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,220
So clearly, the market interprets

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,480
this at the initiations or special

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,040
or increases in dividends as positive news.

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,750
Now, what I want to do next is I will

44
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,030
compute the same average abnormal returns on the days

45
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,010
around this announcement.

46
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,030
And let's see what we get.

47
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,850
So I will go 10 days before the announcement.

48
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,610


49
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:53,720
And I will also go down to 10 days after the announcement.

50
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,412
And I will extend just this number up and down.

51
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:02,620
And because everything here is symmetric in the file,

52
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,200
it's going to compute the average of the returns,

53
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,830
for example.

54
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,650
This would be the average of the returns on the day

55
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,510
before the announcement for these four stocks.

56
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,050
From this table, we could see that the return

57
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,290
on the announcement date itself is the highest.

58
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,270
Let us accumulate these returns and then

59
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,260
plot them to visually see how the market processes

60
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,000
this information.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,160
So in this next column, I will compute

62
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,840
cumulative average of normal returns by doing the following.

63
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,870
For each day, we will add up returns

64
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,110
from day minus 10 all the way to this day, for example.

65
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:50,690
For day minus 8, we will add up the returns from minus 10

66
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,990
all the way to minus 8.

67
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,300
And so for us to effectively do it,

68
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,400
let's fix the top of this array so that we can simply

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,930
stretch this.

70
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,580
And then this would automatically

71
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:12,710
compute all of the returns all the way to the plus 10.

72
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,460
Now, I have plotted the cumulative average abnormal

73
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,360
return.

74
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,040
And this is how the chart looks like.

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,600
So we can clearly see that on the announcement date, day 0,

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,620
there is a strong positive return, again,

77
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,370
which is probably consistent with the fact

78
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,590
that this announcement of dividend increases

79
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,040
or special dividends on average interpreted as good news

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,710
for the future of these firms.

81
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,370
Importantly, we also do not see price drift

82
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,760
is tied in the positive or negative direction following

83
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,350
the announcement.

84
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,420
Therefore, this evidence is consistent

85
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,580
with semi-strong form market efficiency hypothesis, which

86
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,300
says that the prices react to information immediately,

87
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,390
and there is no way for us to earn abnormal trading profits

88
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,600
following the announcement.
