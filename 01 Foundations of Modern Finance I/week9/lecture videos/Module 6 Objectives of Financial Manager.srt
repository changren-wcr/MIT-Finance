1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,870
PROFESSOR: Now let's wrap-up our discussions

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,890
on the objectives of the firm's financial manager.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,280
We have three important results.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,580
First, the manager should always maximize

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,860
the firm's current market value, which

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,270
is independent of shareholders' individual characteristics.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,940
Second, shareholders' financial differences

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,110
can be settled in the financial market on their own.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,020
They can utilize the wealth created by the firm

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,660
to meet their own consumption, saving,

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,130
and investment needs separately independent from the firm's

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,370
decisions.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,830
Third with a rich and well-functioning

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,420
financial market, sometimes also called a perfect market,

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,900
there can be a potential separation between ownership

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,960
and management.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,250
As long as the management adheres to value maximization

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,230
as the objective, they don't need

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,840
to be attached to the shareholders

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,290
or their preferences and views.

21
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,310
The actual financial market is not 100% perfect, of course,

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,740
although for mature markets, it could be

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,830
quite close in many dimensions.

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,420
Imperfections can lead to many additional issues.

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,360
We only list a few important ones here.

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,760
The first point is that a firm may

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,150
have different stakeholders, such as bond holders

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,460
in addition to stockholders.

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,020
Their interests, they will not always be aligned.

30
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,510
In particular, bondholders are mostly

31
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,960
concerned about getting their principal back and interest

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,350
paid.

33
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,600
They care more about the downside

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,050
of the firm than the upside.

35
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,240
Shareholders, on the other hand, care more

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
about the upside than the downside.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,280
These differences can influence a firm's financial decisions

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,040
under certain circumstances.

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,790
Second, with separation of management from ownership,

40
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,660
the management may not always act in the best interest

41
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,700
of the firm's owners.

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,510
Instead, they may put their own interests first.

43
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,240
In this situation, management is also

44
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,310
referred to as the agent of the principle, which is the owner.

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,290
The conflict of interests is also called the agency problem.

46
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,870
Our three conclusions above depend

47
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,540
critically on the well-functioning financial

48
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,200
market.

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,140
In the presence of certain market imperfections,

50
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,130
such as transaction costs, asymmetric information,

51
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,320
and taxes, some of these results will need to be modified.

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,850
For now, we will focus on corporate finance decisions

53
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,310
with a perfect financial market.

54
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,720
We will return to the influence of market imperfections

55
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,620
in part two of this course.
