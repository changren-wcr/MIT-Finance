1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,360
PROFESSOR: To further illustrate these points,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,280
let's consider an example.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,870
Suppose that Mass Biz is a company which

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,660
is listed on NASDAQ.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,970
It is considering two business plans, A and B.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,630
They are mutually exclusive.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,480
That is, we can only choose one.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,580
We have the following information on these two plans.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,540
Both plans have positive NPV.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,099
Plan A has an NPV of $50 million.

11
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:36,590
That is, if it's taken, the current market value

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,916
of the company will increase by $50 million.

13
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,960
Plan B has an NPV of $80 million.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,960


15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,440
Plan A pays off in three years and plan

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,000
B pays off in 10 years.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,345
In other words, they have quite a different horizons.

18
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:57,980


19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,920
Plan A expands the firm's current business

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,700
with relatively low risk.

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,850
Plan B is to enter a new line of business, which

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,080
involves much higher risk.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,630
Which one should the firm take?

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,470
The CEO is recommending plan B to the board

25
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,770
as it has a higher NPV.

26
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,150
$80 million over $50 million.

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,780
Since Mass Biz grew out of a family business,

28
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,500
its board consists of three controlling shareholders

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,480
from the founding family, grandma, dad, and son.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Here are their reactions after hearing from the CEO.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,810
Grandma dislikes B. I'm already 85

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,320
and probably won't be around to see any of its payoffs.

33
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,250
Dad is also averse to B. It's too risky.

34
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,920
I plan to enjoy a quiet retirement

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,440
and have little appetite for risk.

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,720
Son has serious reservations on B.

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,830
The market is over hyped on the kind of business

38
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,160
B is getting into.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,889
As the CEO, how should you respond?

40
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,480


41
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,080
Clearly, shareholders' views are dictated

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,630
by their own financial objectives and perspectives,

43
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,790
which are perfectly reasonable, but also quite divergent.

44
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,440
Fortunately, as far as the firm's decision is concerned,

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,060
it need not to be influenced by shareholder preferences.

46
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,520
In particular, by taking plan B, every shareholder's wealth

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,380
will increase more by her or his share of the $30 million

48
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,100
difference immediately.

49
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,500
This makes all of them better off.

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,120


51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,480
Grandma should not worry about how long it takes for plan B

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,950
to pay off.

53
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,150
Some investors in the market will live to see these payoffs.

54
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,220
That is why they are willing to pay $80 million today for it.

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,130
If grandma needs money for current use,

56
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,360
she can simply sell some of her shares at a high price now

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,900
to raise cash.

58
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,780
There's no need for dad to worry about the risk of plan

59
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,910
B. He does not have to bear the risk of plan B. If he prefers,

60
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,440
he could sell his shares at a high price now for cash

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,710
and then use the cash to buy safer assets,

62
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,110
like government bonds or low risk stocks, only more of them.

63
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,560
Son does not have to agree with the current market prices.

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,550
The key is that some investors in the market

65
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,370
are willing to pay the price, $80 million,

66
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,170
for plan B. If son is not sure about this valuation, again,

67
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,700
he can liquidate his shares after taking out

68
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,910
plan B at high prices and then get out of the business.

69
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,690


70
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,200
What should be clear is that despite the difference

71
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,200
in shareholders' preferences and views,

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,310
plan B will make all of them better off than plan A today.

73
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,730
Their current wealth all increase more

74
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,680
at the current market price.

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,930
This has nothing to do with what they want

76
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,510
to do with this new wealth.

77
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,600
In particular, there is no need for any of them

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,620
to hold their wealth in the form of the firm's stock

79
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,150
in order to wait to see its future earnings

80
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,970
or bear the risk of the stock or risk a future correction

81
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,400
in the stock price.

82
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,630
These are all decisions on how to invest their current wealth.

83
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,750
They can make whatever choices according

84
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,150
to their own preferences or views

85
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,760
through their own transactions in the market.

86
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,880
These choices are unrelated to the decision

87
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,230
to increase the current market value of the firm.

88
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,060
Therefore, plan B is the right choice for the firm

89
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,540
and also for all its shareholders.

90
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,430
There are a few caveats worth pointing out here.

91
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,480
First, our arguments above rely only

92
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,430
on two assumptions about the financial market.

93
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,870
First, it is well-functioning, meaning accessible to everyone

94
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,650
with no frictions for various transactions.

95
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,390
And second, rich, meaning it's efficient for resource

96
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,360
allocation in time and risk.

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,510
It does not necessarily require that market prices

98
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,080
are correct for whatever that means.

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,545
In particular, you don't need to agree with the market prices.

100
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:56,200


101
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,850
Second, it is assumed that the shareholders mainly

102
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,010
care about the financial wealth generated from the firm.

103
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,780
Given that the firm in this case was a family business

104
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,330
to start with and it's still controlled

105
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,480
by the founding family, there might

106
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,400
be other considerations for the shareholders,

107
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,360
such as family name, et cetera.

108
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,000
But these considerations can be addressed

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,700
if needed within our framework.

110
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,980
For example, if the family members

111
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,230
want to hold on to the old business,

112
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,860
they can take out plan B to realize its market value

113
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,750
and then sell it through a spinoff, for example.

114
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,110
Third, it's assumed that there is no asymmetric information,

115
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,590
especially between corporate insiders and the market,

116
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,980
nor fake information by the firm.

117
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,690
That is, the market valuation on plan A and B

118
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,410
reflects all the information available in the market.

119
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,710
This is consistent with the efficient market

120
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,170
hypothesis we just discussed in the previous lecture.

121
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,440
In this case, trading by corporate insiders

122
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,500
won't affect the firm's market prices.

123
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,000
