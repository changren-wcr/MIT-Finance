00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530


1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,470
PROFESSOR: Let's consider one more example.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,600
Tang Associates is a mining company which owns a gold mine,

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,256
King Solomon's.

4
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:15,800
It is considering whether to reopen the mine.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,050
We have the following data on the mine.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:26,290
The mine has a total deposit of 0.11 million ounces of gold.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,030
Extracting the gold takes one year.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,550
It requires initial investment of $86 million.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,280
Gold is currently traded at $800 per ounce,

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,900
and the cost of capital for a gold mine is 10%.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,300
Here the cost of capital is given to us,

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,560
but can you think of a way to find this number yourself

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,500
using the valuation methods we developed

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,740
in lectures on risk, and factor models,

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,890
and arbitrage pricing theory?

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,650
In addition, the current shareholders

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,790
are evenly split into two groups--

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,360
optimists, who are bullish on gold prices;

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,840
and pessimists, who are bearish.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,320
In particular, optimists expect the gold price

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,720
to increase 20% next year.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,380
Pessimists expect the gold price to increase only 5%.

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,870
Given the difference in their views,

24
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,240
the two groups of shareholders may not

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,300
agree on what the firm should do.

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,730
For optimists, $1 million, the NPV for reopening the mine,

27
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,140
is minus 86, the production cost,

28
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,460
plus the present value of future gold sales, which

29
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,530
equals 0.11 million ounces of gold, times the gold price now,

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,520
which is $800, then times 1 plus the growth

31
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,850
rate of 20%, as they expected.

32
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,300
Finishing the calculation, we have

33
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,560
an NPV of $10 million plus.

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,380
By this number, Tang should reopen the mine.

35
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,060


36
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,140
For pessimists, the NPV is computed similarly,

37
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,360
except the growth rate for gold price is expected to be 5%.

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,230
So the NPV will be minus 86--

39
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,850
again, production cost, plus the expected future sales

40
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,390
from gold, discounted at the 10% of cost of capital.

41
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,240
If we finish the calculation, we get minus $2 million,

42
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,970
which clearly goes against reopening the mine.

43
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,370
What should the firm or the CFO do?

44
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,120
Some might suggest taking an average over the two numbers.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,640
Why would any of the shareholders agree to this?

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,300
Each side believes they are right.

47
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,350
How about I get the optimists to buy out the pessimists?

48
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,840
Interesting idea, but at what price?

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,490
Maybe you have more creative ideas

50
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,524
to resolve this disagreement.

51
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:16,190


52
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,610
Instead of going down further on these paths,

53
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,510
let's take a step back and think it over.

54
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,740
The key issue here is how to value one ounce of gold

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,480
next year.

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,730
Different shareholders have different views.

57
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,930
Don't blame them.

58
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,510
If the same question was put to us, most likely we won't agree.

59
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,160
But wait a minute.

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,840
All we need to know is not about the price of gold next year,

61
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,600
but the present value of one ounce

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,480
of gold in one year but today.

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,840
A little poking around about the gold market--

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,760
a very active market.

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,590
We learned the following--

66
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,530
gold, at least those traded in the market,

67
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,490
such as gold bullions and coins, is mostly

68
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,920
held as a long-term investment with no interim payoffs.

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,800
It is often viewed as a storage value

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,519
or hedge against inflation.

71
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,920
If so, for these gold investors, one ounce of gold of next year

72
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,340
is the same as one ounce of gold today.

73
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,700
If they buy one ounce of gold today, most likely

74
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:37,060
they will hold it until next year anyway, or even longer.

75
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,780
In the interim, there's no payoff from the gold.

76
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,130
This is different from holding a bond or stock, which

77
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,000
may pay coupons or dividends during the year.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,870
Holding gold incurs little cost either.

79
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,040
Physical gold is mostly stored at gold depositories

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,470
with very low cost.

81
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,920
It is the claims on them that change hands when

82
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,460
investors buy and sell them.

83
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,890
We will return to this market later in Part 2,

84
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,260
when we study derivative securities on commodities.

85
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,210
From the above observation, we then

86
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,330
conclude that one ounce of gold in one year

87
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,260
is worth the same amount as one ounce of gold today.

88
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,030
Given that one ounce of gold is trading at $800 now,

89
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,480
the present value of one ounce of gold in one year

90
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,130
is also $800 today.

91
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,900
Immediately, we can conclude that the NPV of reopening

92
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,070
the mine is simply minus 86--

93
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,610
again, the production cost--

94
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,310
plus 0.11 million ounces of gold times the present value

95
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,990
of one ounce of gold in one year, and that's $800.

96
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:01,250
Finishing that calculation, we get plus $2 million,

97
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,080
which is positive.

98
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,600
This value is the value we can achieve today in the market--

99
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,110
the current price for selling one ounce of gold

100
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,560
delivered next year is $800.

101
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,440
Therefore, by reopening the mine,

102
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,610
the value of Tang Associates will increase immediately

103
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,530
by $2 million, which will make all shareholders richer.

104
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,570
As for the shareholders themselves,

105
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,720
with their own views on future gold prices,

106
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,640
they can use the market to speculate on their forecasts.

107
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,730
For example, for their pessimistic shareholders,

108
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,810
they can sell the shares at a high price now.

109
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,690
If that is not enough, they can even short gold in the market.
