1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,730
PROFESSOR: We now apply the principles and tools

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,920
we have developed to corporate financial decisions.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,910
As we have discussed earlier, corporate decisions

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,970
lead to changes on both the asset

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,680
and liability side of the balance sheet.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,180
We consider them in turn.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,750
Changes to the asset side come primarily

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,420
from the firm's real investments.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,670
These investment decisions are also

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,940
referred to as capital budgeting-- that is,

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,280
what projects to invest in.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,770
The nature of these projects is very

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,780
general, ranging from expanding existing business to mergers

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:53,100
and acquisitions to a marketing plan or an IT upgrade

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,440
to new business lines, you name it.

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,590
These projects will all add new assets

17
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,910
to the firm, which lead to future cash rolls or earnings.

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,090
Changes to the liability side are related

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,800
to several financial decisions.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,190
The first is the financing decision,

21
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,420
namely how the firm finances its business or assets.

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,030
A firm does so by selling financial assets or claims,

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,650
such as taking a bank loan, issuing debt, stock

24
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,510
in other corporate securities.

25
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,110
The second financial decision is payout--

26
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,580
that is, what to pay to the firm's shareholders.

27
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,650
This includes when and how much the firm pays its dividends

28
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,100
or buy back its shares.

29
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,110
Since payout is primarily about servicing the stockholders,

30
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,170
it can also be viewed as part of financing.

31
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,900


32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,710
The third financial decision is risk management.

33
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,100
Naturally, the firm's business or assets

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,070
are exposed to a range of risks.

35
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,500
Some are systematic, and some are

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,370
non-systematic or idiosyncratic.

37
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,380
What should the firm do with these risks?

38
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,700
With a rich array of financial contracts traded in a market,

39
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,520
the firm can easily use them to adjust its risk exposures.

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,920
Two important questions arise.

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,920
First, what risk should the firm keep,

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,050
and what risk should the firm unload in the market?

43
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,180
Second, how can the firm achieve a risk management goal

44
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,980
after setting one?

45
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,770
Using the balance sheet of the firm,

46
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,590
we can easily capture these decisions.

47
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,710
The asset side reflects the firm's real investments--

48
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,730
in particular, the fixed assets.

49
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,790
The liability side reflects the firm's financing, payout,

50
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,980
and risk management situations.

51
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,870
As an illustration, let us consider a concrete example.

52
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,080
What is shown on the slide is the balance sheet

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,400
of Amazon in 1996 and 1997.

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,828
The numbers are in thousand dollars.

55
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:32,670
In 1996, Amazon's total assets are worth roughly $8.2 million.

56
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,211
Most of them are in cash and securities, about $6.2 million.

57
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:41,430
Fixed assets are about $1.1 million.

58
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,110
The remaining are inventories and prepaid expenses.

59
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,550
On the liability side, Amazon has $2.8 million

60
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:58,930
in accounts payable and $2.0 million in accrued expenses.

61
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,370
It had no debt.

62
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,060
The equity is $3.4 million.

63
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,140
The total liability amounts to $8.2 million,

64
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,210
the same as the total asset.

65
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,700


66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:19,399
In 1997, Amazon's balance sheet has changed a lot,

67
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,970
increased by about 18 times.

68
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,480
The total assets are now worth $149 million,

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,020
with most of it still in liquid assets,

70
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,570
such as cash and securities, for about $125 million in total.

71
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,820
That's an increase of more than 19 times from the year before.

72
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,390
Fixed assets have also increased by about 10 times

73
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,960
to $11.6 million.

74
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,320
On the liability side, Amazon has taken on new debt

75
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,650
to finance its growth.

76
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,130
The debt level has become $78.2 million,

77
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,510
while it was zero the year before.

78
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:09,930
The equity value has also increased to $28.4 million,

79
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:17,370
accounts payable, the other big item, at $32.6 million.

80
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,510
Being an online retailer, at least then

81
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,440
this is not surprising.

82
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,790
So is the large cash reserve.

83
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,930
The balance sheet in 1996 and 1997

84
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,670
clearly reflect what Amazon did in 1997.

85
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:42,400
It issued new equity through its IPO in 1997

86
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,250
and also issued new debt.

87
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,400
The funds raised were used to expand its business,

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,715
including substantial investments in fixed assets.

89
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:54,650


90
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,160
What's shown on this slide is Amazon's balance sheet

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,680
at the end of 2018.

92
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,610
By this point, Amazon is already one of the largest company

93
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,960
in the world.

94
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,480
The fixed assets have grown to over $61.7 billion,

95
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:17,200
while the total assets have grown to $162 billion.

96
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,210
That has also grown to over $23.4 billion

97
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,050
in equity to over $43.5 billion.

98
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,900
These are all in book value.

99
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:35,050
The market value of Amazon's equity was $773.5 billion

100
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,550
at the end of 2018.

101
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,340
This slide shows Amazon's acquisition

102
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,350
of Whole Foods, a food retail chain, in 2017

103
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,610
at the price of $13.7 billion.

104
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,260
This reflects Amazon's expansion into one of the more

105
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,880
traditional retail markets.

106
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Amazon financed this purchase by issuing $16 billion of bonds.

107
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,340
Clearly, after these transactions,

108
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,650
Amazon's asset site will now have

109
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,110
Whole Foods as its new assets, and its liabilities side

110
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,060
will see an increase of debt by $16 billion.

111
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,020
The difference of $2.3 billion will also end up

112
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,860
on the asset side, of course.

113
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,600
In this course, we will consider corporate finance decisions

114
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,340
in three parts.

115
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,460
The first part is capital budgeting,

116
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,310
which consists of two topics--

117
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,420
first, basic capital budgeting, and two, real options--

118
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:48,990
that is, strategic optionality embedded in real investments.

119
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,700
The second part is financing or capital structure.

120
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,060
This part consists of three main topics--

121
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,290
first, optimal capital structure, second,

122
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,180
interaction between investments and financing, and third,

123
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,855
payout policy.

124
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:08,720


125
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,040
The third part is on a firm's risk management strategy

126
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,060
and its implementation.

127
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,510
We will consider basic capital budgeting first

128
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,850
and return to the rest of the corporate finance

129
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,920
topics in part 2 of this course after we have developed

130
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,340
all the tools needed on asset valuation, risk

131
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,050
analysis, and risk management.
