00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
PROFESSOR: In our discussion so far,

1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,090
we have implicitly assumed that a manager's main objective

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,540
in making various decisions is to create

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,140
more value for the firm's stakeholders or shareholders.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,880
In particular, in making corporate financial decisions,

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,510
the manager's goal is to maximize the current market

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,600
value of the firm.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,980
This seems quite intuitive.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,340
But given that this is the starting

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,980
point of our analysis of corporate finance,

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,120
we would like to give it more careful consideration

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,070
before moving ahead with it.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,000
For simplicity, in this part of our analysis,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,570
we assume that the firm is wholly owned

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,670
by its shareholders.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,940
Thus, they are the sole stakeholders of the firm.

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,200
Such simplification avoids the potential conflicts of interest

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,210
where the firm has different stakeholders,

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,220
such as bondholders and stockholders.

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,130
We will return to these situations

20
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,790
later when we examine a firm's financial decisions where

21
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,730
different stakeholders enter the picture.

22
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,800
Under the notion that the manager should

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,520
act in the best interests of the firm's shareholders,

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,480
she faces many factors when making a real investment

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,560
decision.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,610
Let's consider a few of these factors.

27
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,570
First, each investment has its horizon, namely

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,340
a timespan for its cash flow, say, one year, five years,

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,300
or longer.

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,840
In general, shareholders do care about the timing

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
of a cash flow.

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,300
Should the manager, for example, favor projects with shorter

33
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,630
horizons other things equal?

34
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,570
Next, investments are, in general, risky

35
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,230
and shareholders, on average, risk averse.

36
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,420
How should a manager deal with risk?

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,665
Other things equal, say with the same expected payoff,

38
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:12,890
should the manager always choose projects with lower risks?

39
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,025
How about performance measures like earnings?

40
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:18,530
Should the manager always favor projects

41
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,730
yielding higher earnings?

42
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,540
How should a manager a balance between near-term earnings

43
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,100
with long-term payoffs?

44
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,770
Firms often give up short-term benefits

45
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:37,620
to gain long-term returns, such as market share or new markets.

46
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,730
Sometimes, they do so despite the negative reactions

47
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,610
from the market arguing that they

48
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,130
are pursuing long-term value.

49
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,130
Does this make sense?

50
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,830
The list can go on.

51
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,450
But what we hope to show is that with the support

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,000
of a well-functioning financial market,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,900
the only reasonable objective for the firm's manager

54
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,280
is to maximize the current market value of the firm.

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,550
Here are the reasons.

56
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,630
First, current market value is an unbiased financial

57
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,150
objective.

58
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,380
It is determined and supported by the financial market

59
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,180
and is realizable.

60
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,730
You can realize the value of the project

61
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,580
by simply selling the shares in the market.

62
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,070
Second, current market value incorporates the market value

63
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,910
of all future cash flows properly adjusted

64
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,220
for timing and risk.

65
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,280
Factors like timing and risk are taken

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,270
care of by the market valuation through the right discount

67
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,530
rates or cost of capital.

68
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,600
Long-term benefits, if they are recognized by the market,

69
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,560
are also fully included in the expectation of future cash

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,240
flows.

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,800
Third, current market value is independent of shareholders'

72
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,510
differences.

73
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,860
We're going to elaborate a little bit more on this point.

74
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,269
Again, we start with the notion that a firm's manager

75
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,450
should act to help achieving its shareholders'

76
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,970
financial objectives.

77
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,090
Broadly speaking, shareholders' financial objectives

78
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,120
are two-folded as we have discussed

79
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,170
at the beginning of the course.

80
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,890
First, to increase wealth, that is

81
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,250
to increase the amount of economic resources

82
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,470
at the household's disposal.

83
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,190
This is listed on the slide as objective A.

84
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,940
Second, to deploy the wealth to best meet the household's

85
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,080
economic needs which is to achieve the optimal time

86
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,990
pattern and risk profile for its consumption.

87
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,370
These are listed as objective B and C

88
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,060
respectively on the slide.

89
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,130
It is important to realize that with a well-functioning

90
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,540
financial market, households can achieve objective B

91
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,650
and C through their own transactions in the market.

92
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,640
For example, with a $1 in wealth,

93
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,000
a household can use it for consumption today or deposit it

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,760
in the bank account for consumption at any future day.

95
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,180
$1 put it in a bank account gives a safe payoff

96
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,790
in the future, but if the household

97
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,910
wants more payoff when the economy does well,

98
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,980
that is to keep up with the rest of the economy,

99
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,560
like a professor to keep up with his students' future successes,

100
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,550
the $1 should then be put in the stock market.

101
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,140
The household does not need the manager of a firm it invests in

102
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,060
to do any of these.

103
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,450
In fact, it's also impossible for the firm's manager

104
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,810
to worry about these decisions as different shareholders

105
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,420
may have very different financial needs

106
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,470
along these dimensions.

107
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,220
However, there is one dimension they have in common.

108
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,090
It is objective A to have more wealth.

109
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,190
This is where the firm's manager can

110
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,220
help by increasing the firm's current market

111
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,030
value, which goes into a shareholder's wealth.

112
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,460
This is why shareholders invest in the firm in the first place.
