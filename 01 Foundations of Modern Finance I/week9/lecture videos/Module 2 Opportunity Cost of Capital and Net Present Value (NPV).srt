1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:04,100
PROFESSOR: We now consider a firm's real investment

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,740
or capital budgeting decision.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,980
The decision really boils down to the valuation

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,540
of the investment, or the project under consideration.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,110
For simplicity, let's assume that the project

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,230
requires an initial investment of $1 million.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,750
And it then yields an expected return,

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,930
say, x, over the coming year.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,030
How can we tell if this is a good project?

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,240
First, we know that the manager can always

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,510
return the cash to the firm's shareholders

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,340
in the form of a dividend, for example.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,730
Second, shareholders can easily invest the money

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,740
in the financial market.

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,080
Suppose that investment opportunities

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,130
in the market with similar timing and risk

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,140
characteristics as the project offer

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,440
an expected rate of return, r.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,819
This then gives us a benchmark to judge the project.

20
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:09,140
We should take the project only if its expected rate of return,

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,690
x, exceeds r.

22
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,020
Otherwise, the shareholders can just take the money

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,730
and invest in the market.

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:23,790
Bearing the same risk, they can earn r with no cost and effort.

25
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,850
We have first introduced this idea in the introduction.

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,460
We now provide a more formal treatment.

27
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,780
Given an asset or project under evaluation,

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,440
we define its opportunity cost of capital

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,140
as the expected rate of return offered

30
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,370
by equivalent investments in the financial market,

31
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,060
where equivalent refers to their timing and risk

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,800
characteristics.

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,020
The reason for this notion is straightforward.

34
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,220
If we are going to invest in the project,

35
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,980
we will forego the return offered

36
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,580
by the similar assets traded in a market, which

37
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,220
is easily available.

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,330
It is important to know that the cost of capital

39
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,590
is always associated with an asset or project

40
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,150
under consideration, reflecting the market's expectation

41
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,930
of the return on the asset.

42
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,410
It is not related to factors like the firm's

43
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,560
cost of financing by borrowing or other means.

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,480


45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,980
Given the opportunity Cost Of Capital, sometimes labeled COC,

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,800
of a project, the investment decision

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
becomes straightforward.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,020
If the project yields a return higher than its cost

49
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,570
of capital, we should take it.

50
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,910
Otherwise, we should reject it.

51
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,040
In this case, shareholders will be better off not taking it.

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,440
If they are interested in investing assets

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,170
with a similar timing and risk characteristics,

54
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,660
they can easily do so in the market

55
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,670
and earn a higher return.

56
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,070
We now formalize this idea a little bit more.

57
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,950
Suppose that the project has the following cash flow.

58
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,000
It requires an initial investment of I today.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,610
It yields a future cash flow, CF1 in one year.

60
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,170
The opportunity cost of capital for the project is r.

61
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,070
What is the value created or destroyed

62
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,580
by taking on this project?

63
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,990
This is given by the net present value, or NPV,

64
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,460
of the project, which is given by the following formula.

65
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,900
The NPV should equal to the initial investment, which

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,590
is minus I, plus the expected cash flow, CF1, discounted

67
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,520
at the cost of capital, r.

68
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,850
The decision then becomes straightforward.

69
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,470
Take the project only if its NPV is positive.

70
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,630
The firm's current market value should then

71
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,160
increase by the project's NPV when it is taken or known

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,019
to be taken.

73
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,190
For now, we will assume that the project's cost of capital

74
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,930
is given to us.

75
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,750
But from the risk and pricing analysis

76
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,430
we have just developed, we can find

77
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,290
a project's cost of capital or expected rate of return easily.

78
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,610
All we need to do is to find the risk loadings of the project's

79
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,560
return or cash flow.

80
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,130
Then by the arbitrage pricing theory, or APT,

81
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,370
we can determine the project's required rate of return

82
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,290
by the market.

83
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,220
We will return to this part later.
