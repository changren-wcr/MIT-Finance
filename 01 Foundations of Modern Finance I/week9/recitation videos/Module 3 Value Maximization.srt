00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410


1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,350
PROFESSOR: In theory, the goal of a firm

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,620
should be determined by the firm's owners.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,980
A sole proprietorship has a single owner who runs the firm.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,180
So the goals of a sole proprietorship

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,560
are the same as the owner's goals.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,730
But in organizational forms with multiple owners,

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,140
the appropriate goal of the firm is not as clear.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,140
Many corporations have thousands of owners.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,660
Each owner is likely to have different interests

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,300
and priorities.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,520
Whose interests and priorities determine

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,560
the goals of the firm?

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,240
You might be surprised to learn that the interests

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,830
of shareholders are aligned for many, if not most,

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,460
important decisions.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,240
That is because, regardless of their own personal financial

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,630
position and stage in life, all the shareholders

18
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,150
will agree that they are better off if management

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,190
makes decisions that increase the value of their shares.

20
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,770
For example, between January 2013 and June 2018,

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:27,630
the stock price of Netflix has increased almost 30 times.

22
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,230
Clearly, regardless of their preferences

23
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,170
and other differences, all investors

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,160
who held shares of Netflix stock over this period

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,430
have benefited from the investment decisions

26
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,980
that managers of Netflix have made.

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,710
But even when all the owners of a corporation

28
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,230
agree on the goals of the corporation,

29
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,500
these goals must be implemented.

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,560
And in simple organizational form,

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,670
like a sole proprietorship, the owner who runs the firm

32
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:10,710
can ensure that the firm's goals matched his or her own.

33
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,070
But a corporation is run by a management team

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:21,400
separate from its owners, giving rise to conflicts of interest.

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,130
How can the owner of a corporation

36
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,090
ensure that the management team will implement their goals?

37
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,760
Because of the separation of ownership and control

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,020
in a corporation, managers have little incentive

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,930
to work in the interest of the shareholders

40
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,240
when this means working against their own self-interest.

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,560
This is called an agency problem when managers,

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,580
despite being hired as agents of shareholders,

43
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,580
put their own self-interest ahead of the interests

44
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,490
of shareholders.

45
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,720
This agency problem is commonly addressed, in practice,

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,070
by minimizing the number of decisions managers

47
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,090
must make for which their own self-interest substantially

48
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,940
differs from the interests of the shareholders.

49
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,970
For example, managers' compensation contracts

50
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,600
are designed to ensure that most decisions in the shareholders'

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,980
interests are also in the manager's interests.

52
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,820
Shareholders often tie the compensation of top managers

53
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,770
to the corporation's profits and to its stock price.

54
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,740
There is, however, a limitation to the strategy.

55
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,130
By tying compensation too closely to performance,

56
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,780
the shareholders might be asking managers to take on more risk

57
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,770
than they are comfortable taking.

58
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,260
As a result, managers may make decisions

59
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,950
that are too conservative.

60
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,440
On the other hand, if compensation contracts

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,550
reduce managers risk by rewarding good performance

62
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,170
but limiting the penalty associated

63
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,130
with poor performance, managers may have an incentive

64
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,840
to take excessive risk.

65
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,340
Another way shareholders can encourage managers to work

66
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,360
in the interests of shareholders is to discipline them if they

67
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,339
don't.

68
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,060
If shareholders are unhappy with the CEO's performance,

69
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,170
they could, in principle, pressure the board

70
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,400
to oust the CEO.

71
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,110
In 2019, for example, CEOs of Warner Brothers,

72
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,970
Under Armor, Nike, and Boeing were all reportedly

73
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,640
forced to resign by their boards.

74
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,250
Despite this high profile as examples,

75
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,130
directors and top executives are rarely

76
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,880
replaced through a grassroots shareholders uprising.

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,700
Instead, dissatisfied investors often

78
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,870
choose to sell their shares.

79
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,730


80
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,820
When the stock performs poorly, the board of directors

81
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,160
might react by replacing the CEO.

82
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,550
In some corporations, however, the senior executives

83
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,190
are entrenched because boards of directors

84
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,490
do not have the will to replace them.

85
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,090
Often the reluctance to fire happens

86
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,660
because the board members are close friends of the CEO

87
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,660
and lack objectivity.

88
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,220
In corporations in which the CEO is entrenched and doing

89
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,780
a poor job, the expectation of continued poor performance

90
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,070
will decrease the stock price.

91
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,730


92
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:50,120
But low stock prices create a profit opportunity.

93
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,090
In a hostile takeover, an individual or organization,

94
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,880
sometimes known as a corporate raider,

95
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,210
can purchase a large fraction of the stock

96
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,830
and acquire enough votes to replace the board of directors

97
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,330
and the CEO.

98
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,760
With a new superior management team,

99
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,460
the stock is a much more attractive investment,

100
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,520
which will likely result in the price rise and a profit

101
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,290
for the corporate raider and the other shareholders.

102
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,410
Although the words "hostile" and "raider"

103
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,290
have negative connotations, corporate "raiders"

104
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,780
themselves provide an important service to shareholders.

105
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,600
The mere threat of being removed as a result

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,500
of a hostile takeover is often enough to discipline

107
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,070
bad managers and motivate boards of directors

108
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,820
to make difficult decisions.

109
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,270
Consequently, when a corporation's shares

110
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,570
are publicly traded, a market for corporate control

111
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,380
is created that encourages managers and boards

112
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,870
of directors to act in the interests

113
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,440
of their shareholders.

114
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,320
Further potential for conflicts of interest

115
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,320
and ethical considerations arise when

116
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,410
some stakeholders in the corporation benefit and others

117
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,890
lose from a decision.

118
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,800
Shareholders and managers are two stakeholders

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,720
in the corporation.

120
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,200
But others include the regular employees

121
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,160
and the communities in which the company operates, for example.

122
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,050
Managers may decide to take the interest of other stakeholders

123
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,010
into account in their decisions, such as keeping a loss

124
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,880
generating factory open because it is the main provider of jobs

125
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,960
in a small town, paying above market wages

126
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,720
to factory workers in a developing country,

127
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,670
or operating a plant at a higher environmental standard

128
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,760
than local law mandates.

129
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,020
In some cases, these actions that benefit other stakeholders

130
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,770
also benefit the firm's shareholders

131
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,130
by creating a more dedicated workforce, generating

132
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,520
positive publicity with customers,

133
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,730
and other indirect effects.

134
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,280
In other instances, when these decisions

135
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,060
benefit other stakeholders at shareholders' expense,

136
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,570
they represent a form of corporate charity.

137
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,950
Indeed, many, if not most, corporations explicitly

138
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,980
donate on behalf of their shareholders

139
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,700
to local and global charitable and political causes.

140
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,490
For example, biotechnology firm Gilead Sciences

141
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,480
donated $388 million in 2017 to charitable causes,

142
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,170
making it the largest contributor in 2017.

143
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,330
These actions are costly and they reduce shareholder wealth.

144
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,200
Thus, while some shareholders might support such policies

145
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,440
because they feel that they reflect

146
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,890
their own moral and ethical priorities,

147
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,900
it is unlikely that all shareholders

148
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,800
will feel this way, leading to potential conflicts

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,780
of interest among shareholders.

150
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,562
Now, what about society at large?

151
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:25,240
Are decisions that increase the value of the firm's equity

152
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,230
beneficial for society as a whole?

153
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,640
Most often they are.

154
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,200
While shareholders of Netflix have become much richer,

155
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,200
its customers also are better off

156
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,900
with the quality and availability of streaming

157
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,670
content that they might otherwise never have had,

158
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,910
which might be especially valuable during the crisis

159
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,680
times, such as COVID-19.

160
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,260
But even if the corporation only makes its shareholders

161
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,810
better off, as long as nobody else

162
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,570
is made worse off by its decisions,

163
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,900
increasing the value of equity is good for society.

164
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,150
The problem occurs when increasing the value of equity

165
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,870
comes at the expense of others.

166
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,310
Consider a corporation that, in the course of its business,

167
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,760
pollutes the environment and does not pay the cost

168
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,060
to clean up the pollution.

169
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,810
Alternatively, a corporation may not itself

170
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:31,410
pollute but use of its products may harm the environment.

171
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,370
In such cases, decisions that increase shareholder wealth

172
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,770
can be costly for society as a whole.

173
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,200
In economics, we refer to such cases

174
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,700
as negative externalities.

175
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,320
When the actions of the corporation

176
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,650
impose harm on others in the economy,

177
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,840
appropriate public policy and regulation

178
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,740
is required to assure that corporate interests

179
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,875
and societal interests remain aligned.

180
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,690


181
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,460
Sound public policies should allow

182
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,270
firms to continue to pursue their maximization

183
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:16,100
of shareholder value in a way that benefits society overall.
