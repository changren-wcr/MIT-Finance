1
00:00:00,365 --> 00:00:01,740
PROFESSOR: In this video, I would

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,430
like to introduce you to an important tool frequently used

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,010
in corporate finance to analyze corporate financial

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,390
transactions.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,450
It's called market-value balance sheet.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,960
Market-value balance sheet is similar to a "regular," quote,

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,760
unquote, balance sheet that I put here

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,180
for comparison on the right-hand side with the difference

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,120
that both assets and liabilities side

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,750
of the market-value balance sheet

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,750
are quoted in market values, not book values.

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,840
We traditionally distinguish two important parts

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,380
of the liability side of the balance sheet, namely debt

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,620
and equity.

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,320
And we quote both of them in market values

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,820
which, here, I denote as MV.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,920
And equity would also be quoted in market values, not

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,798
book values.

19
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:52,590
On the left-hand side of the balance sheet,

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,950
we have our assets which, again, consist

21
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,890
of cash and long-term assets, which would also

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,060
be measured and quoted in the market values and not book

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,290
values.

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,720
For comparison, we can see that, in the regular balance

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,050
sheet on the right, that equity and assets

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,360
are quoted in their book values and not their market values.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,130
Different corporate financial transactions

28
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,180
may have different impact on the market-value balance sheet

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,160
and on the regular balance sheet.

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,710
And here, we will consider several examples.

31
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,970
Suppose a firm uses cash to build a factory.

32
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,450
For example, Tesla uses its available cash

33
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,710
to build a new production facility.

34
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,630
What impact does this transaction

35
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,560
have on both regular balance sheet

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,940
and on the market-value balance sheet?

37
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,510
Let's start with the regular balance sheet.

38
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,630
Let me schematically draw it.

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,590
In here, I'm going to separate the assets

40
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:05,660
into cash and other assets, which I will call LTA, which

41
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,503
stands for Long-Term Asset.

42
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:11,170
In this particular transaction, the firm

43
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:17,290
uses part of its cash to build additional long-term assets.

44
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,930
In this case, it's a factory.

45
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:26,000
So therefore, it just turns one part of its assets

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,380
into another one.

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,840
And therefore, this transaction has

48
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,390
no impact on the right-hand side of this balance sheet.

49
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,230
So in other words, neither the book value of that

50
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,880
nor the book value of equity are affected as a result

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,880
of this transaction.

52
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,540
Now, things are slightly more interesting

53
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,820
for the market-value balance sheet.

54
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,540
Let me also schematically draw it, and also

55
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:07,960
separate assets into cash, and into long-term assets.

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,290
Let's assume for a moment that this transaction is a zero NPV

57
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,380
transaction.

58
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,360
So then, in this case, the company again just uses cash

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,390
to build a factory.

60
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:26,130
And it doesn't create additional value on its balance sheet.

61
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:33,140
However, if this transaction has positive net-present value,

62
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,580
then as a result of this transaction,

63
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,360
the total value of long-term assets

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,880
is going to increase more than the decrease in the cash

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,120
that we use to build this factory.

66
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,570
So therefore, we're creating this additional value

67
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,350
as a result of this transaction, which again reflects

68
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,110
the fact that the net-present value of this transaction

69
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,690
is positive.

70
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,810
Now, in this case, the right-hand side of this balance

71
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,120
sheet has to increase.

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,680
And this increase has to be proportional with this NPV

73
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,080
so that the left-hand side of the balance sheet

74
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,880
equals to the right-hand side of this balance sheet.

75
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,339
Now, this additional value can accrue

76
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:24,080
to either existing equity holders or existing debt

77
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,430
holders.

78
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,640
So this is debt, and this is equity.

79
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,170
This depends on the extent to which the original debt was

80
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,140
safe or risky, so something that we

81
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,440
will talk more about in the second part of this course.

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,860
If we for a moment assume that this positive NPV accrues only

83
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,330
to the equity holders, then as a result of this transaction,

84
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,310
the market value of equity is going to go up

85
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,910
by the amount of this NPV.

86
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,230
And so this new part would be the new value of equity.

87
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,460
And we will see this in an increase in the share price.

88
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,690
So when the firm announces that it has plans

89
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,323
and it uses its existing cash to build a new factory,

90
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:18,240
the stock price and the market value of equity

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,150
is going to increase by the amount

92
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,125
of this net present value that this transaction creates.

93
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,690


94
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,310
Let's consider a second example.

95
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,010
Suppose that a CEO of a firm dies in a plane crash.

96
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:42,250
What impact does this tragic event have on the regular

97
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,720
and on the market-value balance sheets of this firm?

98
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,150
Let's start with the regular balance sheet.

99
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,280
Let me schematically draw it here again.

100
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,660
So we have assets on the left.

101
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,300
We have debt and equity on the right.

102
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,880
Now, it is very clear that this transaction has

103
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,460
no impact on neither the book value of assets,

104
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,590
because they stay intact, nor on the book value of debt

105
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,110
or the equity of this firm.

106
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,730
So in other words, this event has

107
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,340
no impact on the regular balance sheet at all.

108
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,110
When it comes to the market-value balance sheet,

109
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,380
things are more interesting.

110
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,220
Suppose for a moment that the old CEO was a great CEO,

111
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,490
and the new CEO is not as good.

112
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:39,540
In this case then, the market value of assets will decline.

113
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,410
And let us assume that it is declining

114
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:47,103
by this much to reflect this value loss.

115
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:49,020
This value loss is going to come from the fact

116
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,280
that the plans that the original CEO had for the firm

117
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,020
will not materialize.

118
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,870
And this firm will not be as prosperous

119
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:04,080
as it would have been if it was run by the original CEO.

120
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,270
So the market value of assets of this firm

121
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,670
is going to be this smaller part on this chart.

122
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,880
Now, this value loss, of course, has

123
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,552
to be reflected on the right as well.

124
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:18,510
And so the right-hand side of the balance sheet

125
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,230
is going to shrink by exactly this much.

126
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,900
And this value loss can accrue to both equity holders and debt

127
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,250
holders of this firm.

128
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,970
Again, it depends on how risky the original debt was--

129
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,400
something that we'll cover in the second part of this course.

130
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,850
But it is almost universally the case

131
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,830
that the value of equity of this firm

132
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,860
is going to decline as a result of this event.

133
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,360
And so therefore, we're going to see

134
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,020
that the stock price reaction is going to be negative.

135
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,820
And the market value of equity of this firm

136
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,580
is going to decline.

137
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,280
Let's consider a third and final example.

138
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,570
Suppose a firm issues debt to pay a dividend.

139
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,400
What impact does this transaction

140
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,970
have on the regular and on the market-value balance sheets?

141
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,810
First, let's start with the regular balance sheet.

142
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,990
This transaction increases the book value of debt

143
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,657
by this much.

144
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,240
So suppose that this is how much we're

145
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,380
taking on to pay the dividend.

146
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,320
And it decreases the book value of equity

147
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,420
by the corresponding amount, because this

148
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:32,020
is how much dividend we pay to our existing equity holders.

149
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,260
So therefore, this is the additional amount of new debt.

150
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,620
And this is by how much the new debt grows.

151
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,480
And this is by how much equity shrinks.

152
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,830
And so this is the new value of equity of this firm.

153
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,660
Notice that this transaction has no impact on the left-hand side

154
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,030
of this balance sheet, so the book value of assets

155
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,095
stays intact.

156
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:59,020


157
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,410
Now let's see how this transaction impacts

158
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,380
the market-value balance sheet.

159
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,470
So first, the market value of debt

160
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,500
will increase to reflect the market value of this new debt

161
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,100
that we're issuing to pay a dividend.

162
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,550
And this would be the new total market value of debt

163
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,910
that this firm will have.

164
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,300
The market value of equity will decline proportionally

165
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,400
with the amount of dividend that we pay to our shareholders.

166
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,800
And so therefore, together, these transactions

167
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,560
or these impacts are similar to what

168
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,530
we've seen happening on the regular balance

169
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,390
sheet in book-value terms.

170
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,130
However, these may not be the only effects

171
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,690
that are happening.

172
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,630
Suppose that investors positively

173
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,860
interpret this information.

174
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,790
And as a result, the market value of equity

175
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,690
increases by this much.

176
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,190
This increase in the value of equity

177
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,320
has to be reflected on the left-hand side

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,630
of this market-value balance sheet as well.

179
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,920
And therefore, the market value of assets

180
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,210
has to increase by this much as well.

181
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,220
So therefore, this transaction has this additional impact

182
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,810
on the market-value balance sheet.

183
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,960
So altogether, the market value of debt increases.

184
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,290
The market value of equity decreases, but not

185
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,170
as much as it would have been if there was not

186
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,020
this additional informational impact.

187
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,810
And the left-hand side, or the market-value

188
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,440
of assets of this firm, increases as a result

189
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,690
of this transaction.

190
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,020
Overall, in finance, we're interested in understanding

191
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,830
how various transactions affect the market value of debt,

192
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,870
the market value of equity, and the market

193
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,880
value of assets of the firm.

194
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,623
Therefore, we primarily focus our attention

195
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,040
on the market-value balance sheet,

196
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,960
as opposed to the regular balance sheet.

197
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,990
And therefore, it has an important role

198
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,680
as a tool in finance.
