1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,040
PROFESSOR: Suppose a firm wants to invest in the project.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,950
For example, recently Apple started its TV+ service,

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,590
which competes with Netflix, HBO,

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,110
and other media services providers and production

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,040
companies.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,970
To evaluate this decision, Apple needs to project future cash

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,190
flows TV+ will generate and discount them to present.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,830
Now, what discount rate should be

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,650
used to evaluate this investment decision?

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,890
The answer to this question is that Apple

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,190
should use expected return offered

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,550
in the market on an investment of comparable risk.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,980
To understand why, suppose Apple seeks to raise capital from

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,720
outside investors to finance its investment in TV+.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,030
In order to attract funds, the firm

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,660
must offer an expected return comparable to what

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,480
investors could earn elsewhere with the same risk and horizon.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,000


19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,120
But what if Apple can fund this project internally?

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:21,140
As of March 2020, Apple has more than $40 billion in cash

21
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,130
on its balance sheet, clearly enough to fund any project.

22
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,100
What discount rate should Apple use in order to determine

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,660
whether they should invest in TV+ if they can fund this

24
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,850
project internally.

25
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,280
The answer is the same rate as they

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,020
would use if they financed the project with outside investors

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,970
money.

28
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,810
This is because any funds invested in the new project

29
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,240
could be returned to shareholders

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,240
to invest elsewhere.

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,470
The new project should be taken only if it offers a better

32
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:06,500
return than shareholders other investment opportunities.

33
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,789
We call the discount rate, the opportunity cost of capital

34
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:15,560
or simply the cost of capital for the project.

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,280
The opportunity cost of capital is the best available

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,760
expected return offered in the market

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,250
on an investment of comparable risk and term

38
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,720
to the cash flows being discounted.

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,780
The opportunity cost of capital provides the benchmark

40
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,590
against which the cash flows of the new investments

41
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,280
should be evaluated.

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,890
For a risk-free project, it will typically

43
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,270
correspond to the interest rate on US treasury securities

44
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,940
with similar term.

45
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,640
The cost of capital for risky projects

46
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,870
will often exceed this amount, depending on the nature

47
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,380
and magnitude of the risk.

48
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,170
We will develop tools for estimating

49
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,500
the cost of capital for risky projects later in the course.

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,120


51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,760
An important implication of this insight

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,420
is that the cost of capital for a specific project

53
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,890
may differ from the cost of capital for the entire firm.

54
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,480
In our example, can we use Apple's cost of capital

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,440
for the entire firm as the cost of capital for the TV+ project.

56
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,690
The answer is no.

57
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,670
Apple's primary source of revenue

58
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,690
is iPhone, which is a different product from the media

59
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,370
production and distribution business.

60
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,490
In order to evaluate TV+ service,

61
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,290
we need to use cost of capital of firms engaged in media

62
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,000
business, such as Netflix.
