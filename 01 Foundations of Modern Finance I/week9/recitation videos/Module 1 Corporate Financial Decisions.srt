1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,700
PROFESSOR: To carry on business, a corporation

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,440
needs real assets.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,380
For example, in order to produce cars,

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,070
Tesla Motors needs a factory to assemble them.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,950
In corporate finance, a decision to build a factory

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,940
is what we refer to as an investment decision.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,210
Investment decisions are the most important decisions made

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,550
by the management of any firm.

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,390
A firm's management must weigh the costs and benefits

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,470
of all investments and projects and decide which of them

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,380
qualify as good uses of the money stockholders

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,010
have invested in the firm.

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,230
These investment decisions fundamentally

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,260
shape what the firm does and whether it

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,580
will add value for its owners.

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,770
In this course, we will develop the tools

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,070
necessary to make good investment decisions.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,680
Investment decisions are often referred to

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,320
as capital budgeting decisions.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,720
Once management has decided which investments to make,

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,550
they also decide how to pay for them.

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,590
Large investments may require the corporation

23
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,690
to raise additional money.

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,150
Management must decide whether to raise more money

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,320
from new and existing owners by selling more shares of stock

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,740
or to borrow the money.

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,070
In this course, we will discuss the characteristics

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,310
of each source of funds and how to decide

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,000
which one to use in the context of the corporation's

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,910
overall mix of debt and equity.

31
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,260
We call such decisions financing decisions.

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,120
Let's consider an example.

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,660
In summer 2018, Tesla Motors started developing and building

34
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,530
a factory in Shanghai called Tesla Giga Shanghai.

35
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,620
Their facility's currently producing final assemblies

36
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,260
of the Tesla Model 3 and will produce

37
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,510
Tesla Model Y, with delivery slated

38
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,740
to begin in January 2021.

39
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,940
This is an example of investment decision.

40
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,290
Now, in May 2019, Tesla issued and sold around

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,840
2,750,000 shares.

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,480
In addition, around the same time,

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,130
Tesla issued convertible notes, which

44
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,550
is a type of instrument that has characteristics of both equity

45
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,934
and debt, with the total value of around $1.35 billion.

46
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:28,460
Both the issuance of shares and the issuance

47
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,900
of convertible notes are examples of financing decisions

48
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,750
by Tesla.

49
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,810
In addition to investment and financing decisions,

50
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,120
management must ensure that the firm

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,910
has enough cash on hand to meet its day-to-day obligations.

52
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,470
This job, commonly known as working capital management,

53
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,610
may seem straightforward, but in a young and growing company,

54
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,440
it can mean the difference between success and failure.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,780
Even companies with great products

56
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,520
require significant amounts of money

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,530
to develop and bring those products to market.

58
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,710
For example, developing Airbus 380 cost billions of euros

59
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,380
and took seven years.

60
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,350
A company typically burns through a significant amount

61
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,150
of cash developing a new product before its sales generate

62
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,600
income.

63
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,070
It is the job of Chief Financial Officer, or the CFO,

64
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,030
to make sure that access to cash does not

65
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,130
hinder the firm's success.

66
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,590
When a firm generates sufficient cash flow,

67
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,620
it must decide how to use that cash.

68
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,270
If the firm has new investment opportunities,

69
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,550
it can reinvest the cash and increase the value of the firm.

70
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,640
Many young, rapidly growing firms

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,970
reinvest 100% of their cash flows in this way.

72
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,120
But mature, profitable firms often

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,550
find that they generate more cash

74
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,000
than they need to fund all of their attractive investment

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,710
opportunities.

76
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,010
An example of such firms would be Apple and Microsoft

77
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,150
right now.

78
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,790
When the firm has excess cash, it

79
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,990
can hold those funds as part of its cash reserves

80
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,490
or pay the cash out to shareholders.

81
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,940
If the firm decides to follow the latter approach,

82
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,950
it has two choices.

83
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,730
First, it can pay a dividend, or second, it

84
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,430
can repurchase shares from the current owners.

85
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,860
These decisions represent the firm's payout policy.

86
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,270
In this course, we will discuss what determines a firm's payout

87
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,130
policy.

88
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,500
Another important corporate financial decision

89
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,540
is risk management.

90
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,220
All firms are subject to risk from a variety of sources,

91
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,390
changes in consumer tastes and demand for their products,

92
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,510
fluctuations in the cost of raw materials,

93
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,900
employee turnover, the entry of new competitors,

94
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,370
and countless other uncertainties.

95
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,330
Entrepreneurs and corporate managers willingly

96
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,930
take on these risks in the pursuit of high returns

97
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,650
and accept them as part of the costs of doing business,

98
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,170
but as with any other cost, firms

99
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,890
must manage risk to minimize the effect

100
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,490
on the value of the firm.

101
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,180
The primary method of risk management is prevention.

102
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,210
For example, firms can avoid or at least

103
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,920
reduce any potential risks by making prudent investment

104
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,910
decisions and by conducting appropriate due diligence when

105
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,300
entering into new relationships.

106
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,990
But some risks are too costly to prevent

107
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,750
and are inevitable consequences of running a business.

108
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,030
The firm shares these business risks

109
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,000
with its investors, who buy securities issued by the firm.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,500
For example, some of the risk is passed onto debt holders, who

111
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,550
bear the risk that the firm will default, but most of the risk

112
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,340
is typically passed to equity holders, who

113
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,760
are exposed to the volatility of the stock's return.

114
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,570
Both types of investors can reduce their risk

115
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,000
by holding the firm securities in

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,330
a well-diversified portfolio.

117
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,910
In this course, we will consider the strategies

118
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,980
that firms use to manage and reduce the risk borne

119
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,330
by the investors.

120
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,570
We will learn how firms can use financial markets to offload

121
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,070
the risk associated with changes in commodity prices

122
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,870
and interest rate movements.
