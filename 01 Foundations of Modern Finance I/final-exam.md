## Important notes about the Proctored Final Exam

build in time to do your room scan immediately before starting the proctored exam. Be aware that the #1 reason learners fail proctoring, and therefore the final exam, is failure to do the Room Scan correctly

you may open a blank spreadsheet only. Using a pre-populated spreadsheet constitutes cheating and will disqualify your exam

One “cheat sheet.” Letter or A4. Hand-written or typed. You may write on both sides of it. Need to show this during room scan. Must be in hardcopy. Digital documents are not allowed.

Two sheets of blank scratch paper for calculations. Need to show both sides of both blank papers during room scan.

## Restrictions

- Textbooks or other books
- physical calculators
- Phones
- headphones
- desk must be completely clear

Important: work sequentially. Start with Question 1, then move on to Question 2, and so on. Do **NOT** flip through tabs and look ahead. If you experience an error, we are better positioned to help if you have not clicked through the entire exam.

Before clicking End My Exam and leaving the proctored session, you must clear, close and permanently delete your spreadsheet. Failure to do so will result in your failing the exam.

Round your answers to 2 decimal places. For example, if the answer is 6.2763483, you should input 6.28. If the answer is 6.2723583, you should input 6.27. Other inputs may be graded as incorrect.

You have 1 (one) attempt to answer each multiple-choice question, and 2 (two) attempts to answer each numerical question on the exam.

In a multiple-block question, each sub-question is represented by an individual block that requires you to submit your answer before moving to the next question. This allows us to minimize penalties for carry-through errors. Work on multiple-block questions sequentially. Do not move onto the next question block before submitting your answer to the previous question block. You will be able to see the correct answer to a question after (i) first attempt if your answer is correct, (ii) second attempt, regardless of whether your answer is correct or not. To see the answer, click the "Show answer" button. If your answer is wrong, you must take the correct answer shown to you and use it for subsequent calculations. You should split the screen, left is edx, right is excel

A 100% reliable internet connection is required for the proctored final exam.

Copy/paste functionality is not available in the proctored environment.

During the exam, work only in the downloaded file.

Do not save the file until the very end of the exam. The proctoring software checks and flags this

Clear and Delete the Excel file:

- If you used multiple sheets: delete all the sheets except for the very last one (Excel does not allow you to delete all of them). To delete a sheet, press CTRL and click on the sheet icon in the bottom of the Excel list. Click delete:
- In the remaining sheet, select all cells you used, either manually, or press CTRL + A (CMD + A on Mac).
- And press delete.
- Complete these procedures and confirm that you are left with the empty blank sheet.
- Save the blank spreadsheet. Press CTRL + S (CMD + S on Mac) to save the empty version.
- Finally, delete the file on your computer; then permanently delete the file from your trash bin.
  - Select the file. Press CTRL and Left-click. Choose Move to Trash.
  - Go to Trash Bin. (Most likely Bottom Right Corner on Mac.)
  - Select the file. Press CTRL and Left-click. Choose Delete Immediately.
