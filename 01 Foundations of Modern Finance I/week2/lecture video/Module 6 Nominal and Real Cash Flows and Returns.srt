00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,070
PROFESSOR: Before moving on, we want

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,660
to talk a bit about the unit for measuring cash flows.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,660
They are typically measured in nominal dollars, which

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,220
we call the nominal cash flow.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,850
However, what we really care about

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,580
should be the actual purchasing power

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,600
of the cash flow, which is also called the real cash flow.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,360
When there's inflation, which is present in almost

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,600
every economy, these two can be quite different.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,260
Let's consider a simple example.

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,180
Suppose that inflation is 4% per year,

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,160
and you expect to receive $1.04 in one year.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,870
What is the real value of this cash flow, namely,

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,140
its actual purchasing power?

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,040
What we need to do is to adjust for inflation.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,830
The inflation adjusted, or the real value

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,990
of $1.04 in one year, is given by its nominal value, namely

18
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:08,710
$1.04, deflated at the annual inflation rate of 4%.

19
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,790
That will give us $1, that is the actual purchasing

20
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,670
power of this cash flow in one year,

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,120
namely, the real cash flow.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,330
In general, if the annual inflation rate is i,

23
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,490
and if we are looking at a nominal cash flow, CFT

24
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,690
in year T, the corresponding real cash flow at time T

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,270
would be the nominal cash flow discounted

26
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,320
at the annual inflation rate T times.

27
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,690
We can do the same for rate of returns.

28
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,510
For rate of returns, the prevailing market

29
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,180
rates that we see in the market, for example, the interest

30
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,670
rates quoted by banks, are typically

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,110
nominal rates of return.

32
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,660
But what we should care about will

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,120
be the real rates of return, which are inflation adjusted.

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,740
We can actually look at the following example.

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,600
Suppose that we have $1 to be invested in a market,

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,080
and the market interest rate is 6%, which is in nominal terms.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,870
That means that $1 we put in the bank would turn into $1.06

38
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,680
next year.

39
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,900
But if the inflation rate is 4% per year,

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,060
the real value of this $1.06 is just

41
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,610
$1.019 because we have to discount it

42
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,330
by the annual inflation rate of 4%.

43
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,860
This then gives us the real rate of return,

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,710
which will just be 1.9%, rather than the nominal 6%.

45
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,540


46
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,550
If we do this in general, the real rate of return

47
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,470
should equal to 1 plus the nominal rate of return

48
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,464
deflated at the inflation rate i, then minus 1.

49
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:07,500
In the case that both the nominal rate and inflation are

50
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,650
small, we can also approximate this

51
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,760
by just the difference of the nominal rate

52
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,680
minus the inflation.

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's now consider a concrete example.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,860
Suppose that sales is $1 million this year

55
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,440
and it's expected to have a real growth

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,960
of 2% over the next year.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,440
Inflation is expected to be 4%.

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,870
The appropriate nominal discount rate is 5%.

59
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,180
What is the present value of next year's sales revenue?

60
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,820
From the information given above,

61
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,310
next year's nominal sales forecast should be $1 million,

62
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,470
which is sales this year times 1 plus 2%, the real growth,

63
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,980
times 1 plus 4%, which is the inflation.

64
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,470
That gives us $1.0608 million in terms of nominal revenue

65
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,060
next year.

66
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,320
Its present value should be $1.0608M discounted

67
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,960
at the nominal discount rate of 5%.

68
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,790
That gives us $1.01 million in present value terms.

69
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,089
We can also do this calculation or valuation

70
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:23,870
using cash flows and discount rates in real terms.

71
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,270
Next year's real sales forecasts will be $1 million times 1.02.

72
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,360
That's the real growth that gives us $1.02 million

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,350
in real revenue.

74
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,850
Then the real discount rate should

75
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,660
be 1 plus the nominal discount rate, divided

76
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,280
by 1 plus the inflation, then minus 1.

77
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,800
Finishing that, that gives us 0.9615%

78
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,880
That's the real discount rate.

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,920
Then using the real cash flow and the real discount rate,

80
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,710
we can also get $1.01 million in present value terms.

81
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,550
What this example shows is that when

82
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,480
it comes to the valuation of cash flows,

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,110
we should treat inflation consistently.

84
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,410
If we're going to use nominal cash flows,

85
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,110
then we should be using nominal discount rates.

86
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,170
If we are using real cash flows, then we

87
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,840
should also use real discount rates to discount.

88
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,220
It doesn't matter which one we use,

89
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,620
as long as we use both the cash flow and the discount rate

90
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,080
in the same unit, we'll arrive at the right answer.
