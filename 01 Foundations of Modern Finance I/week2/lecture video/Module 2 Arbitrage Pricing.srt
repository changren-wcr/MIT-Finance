00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,600
PROFESSOR: With a complete financial market,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,300
we can develop a general methodology

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,160
to value assets using the market prices of traded assets.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,010
We will start with a market in which

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,970
a complete set of Arrow-Debreu securities are traded.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,940
With the prices of these Arrow-Debreu securities,

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,020
we can price other assets, securities, or cash flows

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,890
by using the first principle of finance;

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,080
there is no free lunch in the financial market

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,600
without frictions.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,830
With the prices of the Arrow-Debreu securities,

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,270
we can price other assets and the securities.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,060
To illustrate this idea, let's consider a two-state economy

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,210
in which we only have two states for day one.

15
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,990
We have three assets traded in the market.

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,040
The first two assets are the two Arrow-Debreu securities,

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,960
one paying $1 in state one, $0 in state two,

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,600
and the other paying $0 in state one and $1 in state two.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,600
The third asset has a payoff x, paying $3 in state one

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,450
in $5 in state two.

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,650
The question is how is the price of the third asset

22
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,100
related to the prices of the first two, namely

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,220
the two Arrow-Debreu prices, or two-state prices?

24
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,150
In order to answer this question,

25
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,760
we can think of the third asset as a portfolio of the first two

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,180
assets, namely the two Arrow-Debreu securities.

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,790
In particular, we can think of it

28
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,840
as being a portfolio of three units of the state one

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,790
Arrow-Debreu security plus five units of the state

30
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,210
two Arrow-Debreu security.

31
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,360
In this case, the portfolio would pay $3 in state one,

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,080
coming from the three units of state one Arrow-Debreu

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,010
security, and it will pay $5 in state two

34
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,680
form the five units of state two Arrow-Debreu securities.

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,070
The claim is that the price of this asset

36
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,740
x is going to be given by the following equation, namely

37
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,920
its price should equal to three times

38
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,060
the state one state price plus five times

39
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,710
the state two state price.

40
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,470
Since the third asset can be replicated

41
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,400
as a portfolio of the two Arrow-Debreu securities, namely

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,090
three units of Arrow-Debreu security one and five units

43
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,200
of Arrow-Debreu security two.

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,450
Then by no arbitrage, its price must

45
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,980
equal the price of the replication portfolio, namely

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,930
its price P must equal to three times phi 1, plus five times

47
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,790
phi 2.

48
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:12,550
If this is violated, then agents can generate arbitrage profits

49
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,770
in the market.

50
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,790
How?

51
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,720
Well let's see.

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,740
Suppose that actually the price of the third asset, P,

53
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,080
is greater than three times phi 1, plus five times phi 2,

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,000
then what we can do is actually to sell the asset three,

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,460
gaining P, and then buying three units of Arrow-Debreu security

56
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,600
one, plus five units of Arrow-Debreu security two.

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,380
The price difference, in this case would be positive,

58
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,420
will be our current profit, and then the net future cash flow

59
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,660
would just be zero.

60
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,060
So in the absence of arbitrage, we

61
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,720
must have the price of the third asset being

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,800
the same as the cost of the replication portfolio.

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,060
This example shows a more general idea,

64
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,940
sometimes called the Law of One Price,

65
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,650
which states that if two assets have the same payoffs,

66
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,000
they must have the same market price.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,760
Applying this principle, then we can

68
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,720
price all the other securities using the prices

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,880
of Arrow-Debreu securities.

70
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,480
All we have to do is to construct a replication

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,600
portfolio for a particular security,

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,270
and then compute its price using the cost or the price

73
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,670
of the replication portfolio.

74
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,880
Now of course, this all relies on the assumption

75
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,750
that we have the prices of all the Arrow-Debreu securities.

76
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,370
What if we have prices of a bunch of composite securities?

77
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,010


78
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,930
Let's consider a simple example.

79
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,240
Suppose that we have two economic states at day one.

80
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,840
In a financial market, we have two traded securities,

81
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,470
one is a safe government bond, which pays an interest

82
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,740
rate of 5% with no risk.

83
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,430
The other security is a stock that pays $90 in state one

84
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,310
and $120 in state two, and its current price is $100.

85
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,370
The question is, what should be the proper set of state prices?

86
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,640


87
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,630
Well let's see.

88
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,560
From the price and the pay off of the government bond,

89
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,380
we have the following equation; 100 on the left hand side,

90
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,450
which is current price, equals to 105,

91
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,980
its payoff in state one, times the state price for state one

92
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,780
phi1, then plus 105 it's payoff in state two,

93
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,100
times the state price of state two phi2.

94
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,660


95
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,840
From the pay off in the price of the stock,

96
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,910
we've got the second equation, 100, again it's current price,

97
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,830
equals to 90, which the stocks pay off in state one,

98
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,160
times phi 1, plus 120, the stocks pay off

99
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,460
in stock two times phi 2.

100
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,340
These two equations from the prices

101
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,540
of the stock and the bond allows us determine the two state

102
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,850
prices, phi 1 and phi 2.

103
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,490


104
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,970
If we solve for the two state prices,

105
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,380
we've got the following solution,

106
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,420
phi 1 equals 10/21 and phi 2 equals 10/21 as well.

107
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:06,710
Here's a special case in which the state prices are identical.

108
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,760
This example shows that actually if we

109
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,920
have, "regular securities" like a stock in the month

110
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,470
from their prices and the payoffs,

111
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,990
we can actually back out the Arrow-Debreu state prices.

112
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,120


113
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,180
Now let's consider another example.

114
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,950
Suppose there are two states next year.

115
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,190
The payoff of a share of a stock and the probabilities

116
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:40,750
of the states are $90 in state one, $110 in state two,

117
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,020
with the probabilities being 0.4 and 0.6 respectively.

118
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,300
We're also going to assume that the state prices for the two

119
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,700
states are 0.5 for state one, and 0.4 for state two.

120
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,120
We would like to answer the following questions: one,

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,580
what is the stock price today?

122
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,280
Two, what is the expected rate of return on the stock?

123
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,400
The stock price today can be computed easily.

124
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,930
P should just equal to phi 1, the state price for state one,

125
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,910
times X1, the stocks pay off in state one, plus phi 2, time X2.

126
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,290
Plug-in the numbers, it gives us 0.5.

127
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,650
The state price for state one times 90,

128
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:33,200
the stocks payoff in state one, then plus 0.4 times 110.

129
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,230
That gives us 89 as the current price of the stock.

130
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,929


131
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,470
Next, we can compute the expected rate of return

132
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:47,060
on the stock, which is denote by Rbar.

133
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,940
Rbar should equal to the expected payoff

134
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,360
from the start, minus its price today,

135
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,150
then divide by its price today.

136
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:02,180
It can also be expressed as the expected payoff of the spot,

137
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,891
divide by its price today, then minus one.

138
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:10,310
If we plug-in the numbers, that gives us 0.4 times 90,

139
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,490
plus 0.6 times 110.

140
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,492
For the numerator, divide by 89, its price then minus one.

141
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,340
Finishing the computation, we will

142
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,580
get the expected rate of return on the stock

143
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,790
to be 13 divided by 89.

144
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,240


145
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,220
Given the expected rate of return

146
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,220
on the stock by the market, we also

147
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,140
have the following expression; the price of the stock times

148
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,070
one plus the expected rate of return on a stock

149
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,600
should equal to the expected payoff on the stock.

150
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,170
Rewrite this equation, we have the price

151
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,760
of the stock being given by the expected pay off,

152
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,630
divided by one plus the expected rate of return on the stock.

153
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,740
Plug in the numbers, we have 102 for the numerator,

154
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,710
and then 1+ (13/89) for the denominator.

155
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,380
Finishing the calculation, we get 89

156
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:23,070
as the price of a stock, which is exactly what we got before.

157
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,350
So they are basically two ways to compute the stock price

158
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,960
today.

159
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,430
One is by the state prices, the other

160
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:38,260
is by the expected payoff, then discounted by the expected

161
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,600
rate of return on the stock.

162
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,210
Both methods give us the same answer.

163
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,830


164
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,580
In general, in a complete market without frictions,

165
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,200
we can value any cash flow by the no-arbitrage principle,

166
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,865
the first principle of finance.

167
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:00,820


168
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,370
Suppose a firm is considering a project yielding time one cash

169
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,740
flow X, which is X1 in state one,

170
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,240
X2 in state two, et cetera.

171
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,270
Using the prices of Arrow-Debreu securities,

172
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,480
we can then attach a value to this cash flow as follows.

173
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,390


174
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,820
Its value should equal to phi 1, the state price in state one,

175
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:36,760
times X1, its pay off in state one, plus phi 2,

176
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,910
times X2, and so on.

177
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,150
And that gives the current market

178
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,770
value of the project or the cash flow.

179
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,890
This valuation formula encapsulates

180
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,900
the relative or arbitrage pricing

181
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,940
principle, which we are going to be

182
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,270
using for our future analysis.

183
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,720
PV here is also called the present value of the project

184
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,520
or asset or the cash flow.

185
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,270


186
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,500
As we have seen in the previous example,

187
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,070
the present value, PV, is also given

188
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,540
by the expected payoff of the asset

189
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,050
and then the expected rate of return on the asset.

190
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,660


191
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,100
The key idea here when it comes to value an asset

192
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,450
is to find traded assets with similar cash flows,

193
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,060
both in timing and risk, and then

194
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,150
use their prices for the expected return

195
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,150
to value the particular asset we're interested in.
