1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,780
PROFESSOR: As we have discussed, the central problem

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,050
in finance or business decision making in general

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,900
is how to value assets or their cash flows.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,190
A cash flow, in addition to its magnitude,

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,850
has two key characteristics, as we have discussed before.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,660
Its timing and risk.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,210
We are now going to develop a simple model

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,410
to capture the two essential elements in finance, time

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,440
and risk.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,880
We assume that the are two dates for the economy-- today

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,390
and tomorrow, or now and future.

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:44,170
Denoting time by t, t equals 0 for today and 1 for tomorrow.

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,860
Sometimes we also draw a horizontal line

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,540
to represent time.

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,470
The timeline, as shown at the bottom on the right hand

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:00,950
side of the slide, the two dates are marked as 0 and 1.

17
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,129
For day 0, there is no uncertainty.

18
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,000
Before day 1, there is uncertainty.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,150
We describe this uncertainty by assuming

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,960
that there are N possible economic states at day one,

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,070
such as boom or recession.

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,680
We denote the state by s, and it can be 1, 2, or N,

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,150
for state 1, 2, or N.

24
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,090
The likelihood of these states are

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,366
given by their probabilities, P1, P2, and PN.

26
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:43,380
The N states can also be represented by the N branches

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,650
at time 1, as in the graph on the right hand

28
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,980
side of the slide.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,410
We assume that the possible states and their probabilities

30
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,130
are known to all decision makers.

31
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,290
The tree graph on the right hand side

32
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,530
of the slide with the associated probabilities,

33
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,130
is also called a state space model for the economy.

34
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,169
Ideally, the state space model fully

35
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,050
captures the risk of the economy.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,580
The simple model described here may seem a bit too simplistic

37
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,270
for that purpose, but it can be extended easily

38
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,540
to allow many dates and many states, even the continuum

39
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,900
states.

40
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,620
We will consider some of these extensions later.

41
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,090
But for now, our main purpose is to have the simplest

42
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,510
model to capture the key elements needed

43
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,680
for our analysis, and to develop the basic ideas, principles,

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,380
and methods for asset valuation.

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,040
For this purpose, we often even reduce the number of states

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,820
to two for simplicity.

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,580
We now consider a financial market

48
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,430
with no frictions in this economy,

49
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,380
with a set of financial assets being traded.

50
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,640
Assets can be traded at time 0, and the payoffs

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,300
realized at day 1.

52
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,653
Let P denote the price of an asset at times 0,

53
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:18,190
X denote its payoff at time 1.

54
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,190
The value of X in general depends on the state

55
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,900
of the economy at time 1.

56
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:30,460
It will be X1 in state 1, X2 in state 2, et cetera.

57
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:36,560
X can also be represented as a vector of different payoffs

58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,920
in different states.

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,650
It's also called a random variable

60
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,520
denoting unpredictable realizations

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,710
at some future time.

62
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,560
A random payoff is fully defined by its payoff

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,880
in each possible state and the corresponding probability.

64
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,510
Mathematically, we can write it as a payoff vector,

65
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,690
with each element of the vector denoting the payoff

66
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,280
in that state, X1 to XN.

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,562
Together with the corresponding probabilities P1 to PN.

68
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:19,100
Assets traded in the financial market

69
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,040
can have different payoff patterns.

70
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,000
In general, there are many traded assets or securities.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,930
Here, securities refer to financial claims, contracts

72
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,960
traded in the financial markets, such as stocks, bonds,

73
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,350
and derivative securities.

74
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,890
We first introduce some simple securities.

75
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,790
Consider a primitive state-contingent claim,

76
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:50,420
which pays $1 in a single state, S, and nothing otherwise.

77
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,510
It is also called an Arrow-Debreu security,

78
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,590
named after the two economists who first introduced them

79
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,740
into financial market modeling.

80
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,320
Although Arrow-Debreu securities are not

81
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,440
the most divisible or common securities seen in a market,

82
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,750
they do exist in mature markets.

83
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,460
Introducing them here is to facilitate our analysis

84
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,040
in the simplest way possible.

85
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,860
As shown later, their actual existence

86
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,820
is not essential as long as we have a rich enough set

87
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,910
of traded securities, like bonds, stocks,

88
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,410
and derivative securities.

89
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,410
We will denote the price of the Arrow-Debreu claim on state j

90
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,630
by phi j.

91
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,690
Phi j is also called the state price for state j.

92
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,230
State price turns out to be a very useful concept

93
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,020
in our valuation analysis, as we will

94
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,940
see throughout this course.

95
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,650
No arbitrage requires that all state prices are positive.

96
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,280
A security that pays off a positive amount at least

97
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,760
in one future state must have a positive price today.

98
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,340
Otherwise, we can construct an arbitrage.

99
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,480
Since there are a total off N states,

100
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,460
there are also N different Arrow-Debreu securities.

101
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,500
A financial market is called complete

102
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,040
if all the Arrow-Debreu securities

103
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,490
are traded in the market.

104
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,500


105
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,060
Complete market is a useful abstraction, as we'll see soon.

106
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,720
It merely means that the financial market is rich enough

107
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,380
in terms of the securities being traded in the market.

108
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,700
As we said in the introduction, there

109
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,170
are indeed tens of thousands of securities being traded

110
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,820
in the global financial market.

111
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,120
For most of the applications we discussed in this course,

112
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,460
assuming a complete financial market is

113
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,470
a reasonable starting point.

114
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,120
More discussion on this point will

115
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,750
occur when we develop more detailed risk and valuation

116
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,300
models.
