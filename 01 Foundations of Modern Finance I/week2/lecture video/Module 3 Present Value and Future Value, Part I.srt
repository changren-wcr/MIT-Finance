00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,220
PROFESSOR: Using market prices, prices

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,430
or expected returns of traded assets,

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,730
we can value a particular asset, project,

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,450
or cash flow, its current market value or present value.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,790
We now expand on this idea to further

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,300
develop some techniques to value a cash flow

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,410
or to compute its present value.

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,580
We will do so by starting with a couple of examples,

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,509
the extensions of the simple examples we considered

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,100
in the introduction.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,570
We will start with the simplest case possible.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,420
That is, $1,000 of a safe cash flow in one year.

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,990
The question is, how much should that cash flow be worth today?

14
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,230
Let's suppose that in a market similar assets,

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,190
namely safe assets, are offering an annual return of 2%.

16
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,030


17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,700
Think of a potential buyer of this cash flow.

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,390
She would also expect a 2% annual return,

19
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,050
same as what other safe assets offer in a market.

20
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,150
Let the price she's willing to pay be P. Then we

21
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,370
have the following equation.

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,160
Namely, P, which is the price she is paying,

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,100
times 1 plus the 2% return she expects to get.

24
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,390
That should equal to the total cash flow at the year end.

25
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,550
That's $1,000.

26
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,570
We can solve this equation for the price, P,

27
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,270
which would equal to $1,000.

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,860
That's the expected cash flow in this case with certainty.

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:55,220
Divide by 1 plus the expected rate of return, 2%.

30
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,630
If we finish that computation, we're getting P to be $980.

31
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,610
This is a rounded number.

32
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,550
So this is really what any investor in a market

33
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,190
would be willing to pay, which is also

34
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,950
what we call the present value or the current market

35
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,750
value of this cash flow.

36
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,420
It's really given by the expected cash

37
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,190
flow from this asset--

38
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,950
in this case, $1,000 for sure--

39
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,640
discounted at the required rate of return of 2%.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,020
So this formula is sometimes also called

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,900
the discounted cash flow formula, namely,

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,350
the value of a cash flow when an asset is

43
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,070
given by its expected payoff discounted

44
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,800
at appropriate discount rate.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,630
Now of course, we realize this discount rate really reflects

46
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,920
the time value of money.

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,950
It adjusts for the fact that $1,000 is occurring-- not now,

48
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,770
but one year from today.

49
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,350
In the second example, we can assume

50
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,360
that this $1,000 in one year, it's no longer certain.

51
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,830
But rather, it's risky.

52
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:19,220
The question is how much should it be worth today?

53
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,590
Let's again look at the market.

54
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,560
Suppose that traded assets of similar risk

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,760
offer an expected annual rate of return of 20%.

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,320
Well, given that, we can easily compute the current market

57
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:41,100
value for this cash flow of $1,000 in one year.

58
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,960
The potential buyer, again, would

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,400
expect a 20% return on this by paying the current price--

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,890
let's say, P.

61
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,320
So by looking at this equation, P times 1 plus 20%

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,990
should equal to $1,000, the expected

63
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,840
payoff from this risky asset.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,670
The present value of this cash flow

65
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,620
then is given by this simple discounted cash flow formula,

66
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,160
namely, $1,000 of expected cash flow discounted

67
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,460
at the 20% rate of return, which is

68
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,760
the market's expected rate of return for assets

69
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,829
with this level risk.

70
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,079
If we finish the calculation, that

71
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,590
gives the present value or the current market price

72
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,850
for this cash flow of $833.

73
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,720
As we noticed, the discount rate here of 20%

74
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,730
is quite a bit higher than the 2% in the previous example,

75
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,450
where the cash flow is certain.

76
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:51,640
This actual rate of return reflects the risk premium.

77
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,750
So the present value formula really

78
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,770
properly adjusts for risk by choosing

79
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,085
the appropriate discount rate for assets with same risks.

80
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:07,910


81
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,290
From the two examples, we can generalize the current market

82
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,840
value of a cash flow or its present value

83
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,760
is determined by two factors.

84
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,090
First, its expected payoff.

85
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,430
Second, an appropriate discount rate,

86
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,510
where the discount rate is given by the expected rate of return

87
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,030
on traded assets with similar cash

88
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,540
flows in both timing and risk.

89
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,690
In particular, the present value of a cash flow

90
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,370
is given by its expected cash flow discounted

91
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,280
at an appropriate discount rate, r bar.

92
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,460
Therefore, the value of an asset or cash flow

93
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,980
is determined by the financial market

94
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,860
through the discount rate or expected rate of return,

95
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,080
or required rate of return.

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,230
They all mean more or less the same thing.

97
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,390
The discount rate here should properly

98
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,250
adjust for time and risk of the cash flow.

99
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,610
The discount rate is also called the opportunity cost of capital

100
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,440
because it is the return offered by similar assets traded

101
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,230
in the market.
