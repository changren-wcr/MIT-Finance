00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800


1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,870
PROFESSOR: The present value looks

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,410
at the current value of a future cash flow

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,580
by discounting back at the appropriate discount rate.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,010
We can also consider the future value of a cash flow

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,790
today by allowing it to grow at the proper rate of return.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,880
Suppose that we have $1 today.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,550
What would be its worth in one year

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,740
if the interest rate is 4%?

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,930
Well, we could certainly invest that $1 in the market,

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,330
earning a rate of return of 4%.

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,770
In one year, that $1 would turn into $1.04,

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,500
where $0.04 will be the interest on the $1 initial investment.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,550
So $1.04 will be the future value

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,000
of $1 in one year at the market rate of 4%.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,500


16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,160
What about its future value in T years?

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,300
Well, we will just have to multiply 1 plus the interest

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,730
rate T times.

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,340
So the future value of $1 in T years

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,310
will be 1 plus r raised to the Tth power.

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,140


22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,390
Let's consider a complete example.

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:26,600
Suppose a bank issues a CD with an annual interest of 4%.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,470
And this is a 2-year CD.

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,260
Suppose that you deposit $10,000.

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,640
What will be your balance in two years?

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,850
It would just be $10,000 times 1 plus the interest rate of 4%.

28
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,000
Raise it to the power of 2.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,420
And in that, it will give us $10,816.

30
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,390
And that is the future value of $10,000 today in two years.

31
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,300
Business decisions often involve choices

32
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,580
between different alternatives.

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,690
Each alternative may involve a stream of cash flow

34
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,789
with many pieces.

35
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,730
Comparing these cash flows is not trivial

36
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,800
given that they have multiple pieces.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,470
Let's consider the following example.

38
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,890
A drug company has developed a new flu vaccine

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,920
and needs to choose between two strategies.

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,100
Strategy A is to bring to market in one year, invest $1 billion

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,850
now, and returns $500 million in year 1, $400 million year 2,

42
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,660
and $300 million in year 3.

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,120
Strategy B involves bringing the vaccine to market in two years,

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,870
investing $200 million in year 0 and 1,

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,240
and then returns $300 million in year 2 and 3.

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,920
How do we make a decision between strategy A and B?

47
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,800
In particular, how do we value, or compare,

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,140
these two strategies, or their cash flows?

49
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,010
Of course, the cash flows of the two strategies being

50
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,460
multi-dimensional cannot be easily ranked.

51
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,240
With the present value, however, the ranking becomes simple.

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,140
The present value of a cash flow or its current market price

53
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,220
is a number, a scalar, which can be easily compared.

54
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,630
First, we note that the present value of a stream of cash flow

55
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,580
is simply the sum of the present value of each piece of the cash

56
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,030
flow as given in the present value formula here.

57
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,190


58
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,660
Suppose that the right discount rate is 5%.

59
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,660
We can then price the two strategies easily.

60
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,200


61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,980
Let's first consider strategy A. Its cash flow in period 0

62
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,370
is minus 1 billion.

63
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,910
And here, the numbers are in millions.

64
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,670
In year 1, it's going to return a positive cash

65
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,890
flow of 500 million, in year 2, 400 million, in year 4,

66
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,760
300 million.

67
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,420


68
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,210
With the discount rate of 5%, we can easily

69
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,470
compute the present value of each piece of this cash flow

70
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,350
stream.

71
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,540
1 billion today is 1 billion today in present value.

72
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:44,070
$500 million in year 1 would be 476.2 million

73
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,410
in present value terms.

74
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:52,020
$400 million in year 2 would be $362.8 million

75
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,460
in present value terms and so on.

76
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,570
If we add up the present value of each of the pieces,

77
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,240
we get $98.2 million.

78
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,100
That is total present value of strategy A.

79
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,520
We can then do the same for strategy B.

80
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,920
The cash flow from strategy B is given

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,690
by the second row in the lower panel in the table,

82
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,920
and the present value is given by the third row.

83
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,140
If we add up the present value of all the pieces for strategy

84
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:35,760
B, we get $140.8 million.

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,280
Now, with the net present value for strategy A and B

86
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,330
respectively, we can easily make a choice.

87
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,930
Clearly, strategy B will give us a higher present value,

88
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,430
and that is a better strategy.

89
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,960
This example shows, if we can value each of the alternatives,

90
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,140
the final decision becomes straightforward.

91
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,360
Pick the one with the highest present value,

92
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,790
assuming it's positive.

93
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,140
We will see more detailed applications later

94
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,040
in corporate investment decisions.
