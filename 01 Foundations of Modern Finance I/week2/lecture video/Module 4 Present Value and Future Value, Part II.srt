00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,540
PROFESSOR: So far we have been looking

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,210
at the simple case in which there's

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,029
a single piece of cash flow occurring

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,640
one period from today, say, in year 1.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,560
What about a cash flow that's going

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,460
to occur many years from today, say, in year T,

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,430
and cash flow is CFT.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,280
Well, the present value of this cash flow

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,230
can be easily computed by taking the cash flow, CFT, discounted

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,850
back at the right discount rate, r, T times.

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,020
From now on, for simplicity, we'll use r instead of r bar

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,170
to denote the discount rate, unless otherwise noted.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,040


14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,110
Let's consider a simple example.

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,030
Suppose we are choosing between two cash flows: $10 million

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,760
in five years, or $15 million in 15 years.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,640
We can't quite just compare the magnitude

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,700
because they occur at different points in time.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,160
Which one is better very much depends

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,070
on how the market values different cash

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,660
flows at different times.

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,250
Suppose that the right discount rate is 5%.

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,170
Namely, that's the expected return

24
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,200
from these kind of safe cash flows.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,320
Then we can easily compute the present value

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,240
for these two pieces of cash flow.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,080
The present value for cash flow A, which is $10 million

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,430
in five years, can be discounted at 5% five times.

29
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,110
That gives us a present value of $7.84 million.

30
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,220
For cash flow B, the present value is $15 million,

31
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,500
discounted at 5% 15 times.

32
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,690
That gives us $7.22 million.

33
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,540
Of course, in this case, cash flow A

34
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,910
is better because it has a higher present value.

35
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,730
The previous example also shows how

36
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,040
the present value of a cash flow depends

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,190
on how far it is from today.

38
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,850
This is also shown in this graph.

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,260
What's shown by that black line is the present value

40
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,760
of the cash flow, $1, when it occurs at different points

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,950
of time in the future.

42
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,730
Going from year 1 to from the left to year 20 and 30.

43
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,720
As we can see, as the cash flow is farther and farther away

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,710
from today, its present value decreases.

45
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,280
And it's simply because the discount.

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,650
When it's far away from today, it

47
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,250
will be discounted many more times.

48
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,980
The present value also depends on the discount rate,

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,850
of course.

50
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,790
And what's shown here also will be

51
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:08,050
how the present value of a cash flow, say $1, for a given time,

52
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,520
say, 10 years.

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,970
And then when we change the discount rate from,

54
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,500
let's say, 4%, which is for the black line,

55
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,660
to 8%, which is shown by the dashed red line,

56
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,140
or to 12%, which is shown by the dotted blue line.

57
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,430
Clearly for the same cash flow, same horizon,

58
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,510
if the discount rate increases, its present value decreases.

59
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,600
So this is an important relationship for us

60
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,290
to remember.

61
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,110
Namely, when a discount rate goes up

62
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,810
for the same magnitude of the cash flow,

63
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,860
its present value decreases.
