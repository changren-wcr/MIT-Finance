1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,680
PROFESSOR: In this problem, we're given state prices.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,430
And we're asked to find the price of the bond.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,900
To find the price of the bond, we

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,060
have to multiply the payout that we get from this bond

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,780
by their state prices.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,340
We have only two states in this particular case.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,210
So, therefore, the price of the bond equals to the payoff

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,430
that we get in the first state, multiplied

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,980
by the price of that state, plus the payout that we

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,940
get in the second state, times the price of that second state.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,640
It's $100 times 0.35 plus $100 times 0.55.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,140
That gives us $90.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,480
So the price of this bond today is $90.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,480
Notice this is a riskless bond.

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,370
So one shortcut that we can take here

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,840
is just simply to add up state prices, 0.35 plus 0.55--

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,230
that gives us 0.9--

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,720
and multiply by the payoff that we

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,990
get from this bond, $100 in both states.

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,040
So that would give us $90.
