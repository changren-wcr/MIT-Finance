PROFESSOR: What is the average annual rate of return

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,240
that we earned on this purchase?

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,480
Let us denote by x the purchase price of this apartment

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,670
that we paid for 20 years ago, and by 3x its present value,

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,120
because it's tripled since the time we purchased it.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,300
To help us think in terms of present and future value

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,770
in this particular problem, let's shift the timeline 20

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,810
years to present, and denote the starting point by t

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,390
equal to zero, and this ending point by t equal to 20.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,620
Then x times 1 plus r raised to the power of 20

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,520
would be the future value of this x in 20 years from now,

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,710
and it has to equal to its actual future value

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,755
right now which is 3x.

14
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:50,130
The only thing we have to do here

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,710
is to solve this equation for r.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,320
Well x is, of course, irrelevant here,

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,450
so it cancels out from this equation.

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,800
And then we are left with one plus r equal to 3

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,510
raised to the power 1/20.

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,600
Solving this equation gives us the interest rate of 5.65%.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,400
So the answer to this question is

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,670
that the average annual rate of return that we earned

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,170
on this purchase is 5.65%.
