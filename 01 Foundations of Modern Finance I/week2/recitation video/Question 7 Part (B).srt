PROFESSOR: The next question asks,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,410
what is the present value of your real rental revenue

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,290
that you expect to receive next year?

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,540
To find the present value of real revenue

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,210
that we expect to get next year, we

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,140
have to discount it to present at the real discount rate.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,080
Applied to our case, this is $669,500, which

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,040
is our real revenue that we'll get next year,

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,659
discounted to present at the 6% real discount

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,760
rate, which gives us $631,604.
