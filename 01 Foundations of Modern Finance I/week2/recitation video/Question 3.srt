00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:01,690
PROFESSOR: In this question, we're

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,210
given a state-space model that has

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,280
three states and three assets currently traded in the market.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,380
Asset 1 is a riskless bond with the current price of $95.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,620
It pays $100 in each of the three states.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,250
Asset 2 is a stock.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,210
Its current price is $150.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,730
And it pays $250 in state 1, nothing in state 2,

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,450
and $500 in state 3.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:39,250
And finally, asset number 3 is another stock that is currently

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,700
priced and traded at $100.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,610
And it pays $0 in states 1 and 2.

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,880
And it pays $500 in the state 3.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,820
The question is, what are the state prices?

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,550
To answer this question, let's start

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,160
by writing down the pricing equation that

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,350
connects the payoff that we get from an asset with the state

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,310
prices.

19
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,452
So recall that in question two, we

20
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:11,160
were working with the following equation.

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,920
So the price of any asset equals to the payoff

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,600
that asset pays in the first state multiplied by the state

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,640
price of that state.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,380
And similarly, what that asset pays

25
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,520
in the second state times the price of that second state,

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,850
plus here we have three states in total,

27
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,300
so we have the third state as well.

28
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,030
So now we can write down the prices

29
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,340
of each of our three assets as the function of the state

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,670
prices and what these assets pay in each of the states.

31
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,790
So let's start with the riskless bond.

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:57,220
So we get 95 equals to phi 1 multiplied by 100

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:07,620
plus phi 2 multiplied by 100 plus phi 3 multiplied by 100.

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,652
Now for the second asset, or for our first stock,

35
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,360
we can write down the following equation.

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,230
So its current price is $150.

37
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,980
And it pays $250 in the first state.

38
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,610
So it's phi 1 multiplied by 250.

39
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,500
It doesn't pay anything in the second state,

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,650
so it's going to be phi 2 times 0, which is 0.

41
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,210
Plus phi 3-- and I can put 0 here--

42
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,670
phi 3 times 500.

43
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,660
And finally, for the asset number 3, or the second stock,

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,150
we can write down the pricing equation

45
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,400
for that stock, which is 100 equals

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,280
to phi 3 multiplied by 500.

47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,770
And so the remaining, phi 1 times 0 is 0.

48
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,950
And phi 2 times 0 is 0 as well.

49
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,680
So now we have this system of equations with three unknowns.

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,020
It's a very easy system of equations to solve.

51
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:13,290
So from the last equation, we get phi 3 that equals 0.2.

52
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,855
We can plug this phi 3 into the second equation.

53
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:19,230
And by solving that equation, you

54
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:27,070
could verify that phi 1 would equal to 0.2 as well.

55
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:33,180
And finally, we can plug phi 3 and phi 1 into equation 1

56
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,600
and solve that equation for phi 2.

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,230
And so if we do that, we find that phi 2--

58
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,730
and I will write it down here--

59
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:48,940
so phi 2 would equal 0.55.

60
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:56,760
So altogether, we get that the state prices, in this case,

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,040
equal to--

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:05,310
so phi 1 equals to 0.2, phi 2 equals 0.55,

63
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,760
and phi 3 equals 0.2 as well.

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,610
So this is the set of the state prices

65
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,506
in this state-space model.

66
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,839
If we were to use the state prices to price these assets

67
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,510
again given their payoffs, the way we have priced assets

68
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,253
in question two, we would have found

69
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:29,670
that each of these assets, so the riskless bond, its price

70
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,020
would be $95.

71
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,880
The price of stock 1 would be $150.

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,600
And the price of stock 2 would be $100.

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,430
So altogether, this question teaches you

74
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,290
how to find the state prices from the given

75
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,040
prices of traded assets.
