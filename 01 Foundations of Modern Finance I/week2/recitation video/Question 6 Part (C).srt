00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,978
INSTRUCTOR: So part C of this question asks us--

2
00:00:03,978 --> 00:00:05,520
how much of the wealth growth in B is

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,170
due to return earned in the previous return?

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,880
Well, to answer this question let's

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,310
first compute the total return that we

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,840
would earn just on the principal amount that we invested.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,990
The annual return on the principal amount is just 10.2%

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,650
times x.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,680
And since we're earning this over a 20-year period,

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,600
this would be just 20 times 10.2 times x.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,800
So our wealth would grow just 2 times

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,110
if we were earning a return just on the principal amount

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,220
invested.

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,710
But in B, we computed that our wealth grows 7 times, so 7x.

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,610
So the difference between this 2x and 7x

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,295
is the return that we earn on previously earned return.

17
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:55,670
And in this case, it's very clear

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,680
to see that most of our wealth that we are generating

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,850
on our investment is due to return that we are earning on

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,040
previously earned return.
