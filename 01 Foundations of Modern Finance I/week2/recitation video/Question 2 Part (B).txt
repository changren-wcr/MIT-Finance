PROFESSOR: The second question asks,
what is the price of the stock today?
To find the price of the stock, we again multiply the payoff
that we get from the stock in the first state,
by the state price of the first state,
plus the payoff that we get from the stock in the second state,
times the price of the second state.
It's 150, multiplied by 0.35, plus $40
that we get from the stock in the second state, times 0.55.
This gives us $74.50.
So the price of the stock today is $74.50.
