00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,170
PROFESSOR: Let's look at state prices again.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,560
The price of state two is .55.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,103
And the price of states one and three is just 0.2.

4
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:10,770
So the price of state two is much higher

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,080
than the price of states one and three.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,850
This means investors are willing to pay a higher price

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,000
to receive $1 in state two.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,990
Put differently, investors value of money in state

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,670
two more than they do in states one and three.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,270
State two, for example, can be an economic recession.

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,100
In recessions, many economic agents

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,450
may receive lower income.

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,530
For example, workers may receive lower wages,

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:47,990
firms may earn lower profits, therefore, a security

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,740
that pays money in bad states of the world, typically

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,680
has higher prices, because money in bad states is more valuable.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,580
Assets x and y pay off the same amount in state one.

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,860
However, asset x pays off $80 in state two

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,870
and $100 in state three.

20
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,080
While asset y pays off $100 in state two and only $80

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,730
in state three.

22
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,060
So therefore, y pays $20 more in the bad state,

23
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,210
while x pays off $20 more in good state.

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,730
So intuitively, this implies that the price of y

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,740
should be higher than the price of x.

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,410
And because asset y pays more when money is more valuable,

27
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,380
investors are willing to accept a lower rate of return

28
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,580
from investing in asset y compared to asset x.

29
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,300
Indeed, as we have seen above, the expected return on asset x

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,350
is 11.11%, while in asset y, it is only 2.56%.
