00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,400
PROFESSOR: The second question asks us to find the price

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,660
and expected return of asset Y. Asset Y

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,970
pays off $100 in the first state,

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,540
$100 in the second state, and $80 in the third state.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,830
Let's start with the price.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,602
The price of asset Y equals to the payoff

7
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,560
that we get from this asset in the first state,

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,430
$100, times the price of the first state, 0.2,

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,060
plus the payoff that we get in the second state, also $100,

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,220
times the price of the second state,

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,000
0.55, plus $80 that we get in the third state times the price

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,800
of the third state, 0.2.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,840
This gives us the price of this asset, $91.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,850
Now, to find the expected return,

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,190
we again start with the expected payoff

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,500
that we get on this asset.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,817
The expected payoff would equal to the payoff

18
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,400
that it would get in each of the three

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,153
states times the probabilities of each of the three states.

20
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,320
Because each of the three states are equally likely,

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,590
the probability is, again, 1/3.

22
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,170
So putting this all together gives us $93.33.

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,390
Now, notice that the expected payoff on asset Y, $93.33,

24
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,870
is exactly the same as the payoff of that we computed

25
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,740
on asset X in part A. This is due to the fact

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:24,370
that the payoffs from assets X and Y are similar in the sense

27
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:30,850
that both of them give us $100 in the first state.

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,850
But in the second state, asset X pays off $80,

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,556
while Y pays off $100.

30
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:43,450
And in the third state, asset X pays off $100,

31
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,900
while Y pays off $80.

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,690
Because of the symmetry and because of the fact

33
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,910
that each of these states are equally likely

34
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:57,040
and occur with likelihood 1/3, the expected payoff of asset X

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,190
is the same as the expected payoff of asset Y.

36
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,880
So finally, to find the expected return on asset Y,

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,310
we're taking the expected payoff, $93.33,

38
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,980
we're subtracting the price of asset Y, which is $91,

39
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,640
and dividing it by the price of this asset Y, $91.

40
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,790
This gives us 2.56%.

41
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,500
So the expected return on asset Y is 2.56%.

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,000
