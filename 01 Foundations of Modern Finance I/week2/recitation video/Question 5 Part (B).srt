00:00:00,247 --> 00:00:01,830
PROFESSOR: In part B of this question,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,530
we are asked again to pick between two options.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,580
Option one, which is the same, it gives us $10,000 today,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,780
and option two gives us $18,000 in 10 years.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,280
To choose between these two options,

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,210
we are going to compare their value at one point in time.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,910
We're going to compare their value at present.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,030
The present value of option one is just $10,000.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,110
The present value of option two is $18,000

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,060
received 10 years from now, discounted

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,990
to present at 8% rate, which gives us $8,337.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,390
Since the present value of option one

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,670
is greater than the present value of option 2,

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,040
in this case, we would prefer to take

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,670
$10,000 right now as opposed to waiting 10 years

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,300
and receiving $18,000.

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,520
To develop intuition, let's look at this problem

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,030
from a different angle.

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,590
Let's take this $10,000 and invest it

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,280
in an asset that has similar risk that our sisters promise,

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,440
and therefore offers the same 8% rate of return.

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,800
If we do so, in the future we will get $10,000 multiplied

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:24,450
by 1 plus 8% raised to the power of 10, which gives us $21,590.

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,610
So the future value of $10,000 invested at 8% for 10 years

25
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,210
is $21,590.

26
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,460
This is a higher amount then what

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,770
we would receive from our sister in 10 years-- $18,000.

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,420
So therefore, we are better off taking $10,000 today

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,800
and investing it at an 8% rate and receiving $21,590.

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,270
10 years from today.
