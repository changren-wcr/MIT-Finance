PROFESSOR: What is the expected rental revenue next year
in real terms?
Well the current revenue they just
recorded for this year that just passed is $650,000.
Next year your real revenue, or revenue in real terms,
is the current revenue multiplied
by 1 plus the growth rate.
Notice that this growth rate is actually the real growth rate.
And so in our cases then it's $650,000,
the current revenue, multiplied by 1
plus 3%, which is our real growth
rate, which gives us $669,500.
