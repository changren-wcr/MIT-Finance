00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,550
PROFESSOR: Question d, what is the present value

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,560
in nominal rental revenue next year?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,180
The present value would equal to the nominal revenue

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,660
that you receive in the year one, discounted to present

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,980
at the nominal discount rate.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,190
Now the question does not give us directly

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,270
the nominal discount rate.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,310
So we have to find it.

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,880
To find a nominal discount rate, we use the following equation.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,840
1 plus the nominal discount rate would equal to 1

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,650
plus real discount rate multiplied by 1

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,740
plus the rate of inflation.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,160
Plugging this equation into here,

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,390
we'll get nominal revenue in the year 1 divided by 1

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,710
plus real discount rates multiplied

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,610
by 1 plus rate of inflation, which gives us

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:01:00,920
$686,237.50 divided by 1 plus 6%, which is the real discount

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,360
rate multiplied by 1 plus 2.5%, which is the rate of inflation,

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,380
which gives us $631,604.

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,620
Now notice the present value that we get in this question

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,590
is exactly the same as we've gotten in part

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,510
b of this question.

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,843
The present values, of course, should not

24
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:27,260
be affected, whether we're dealing

25
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,620
with nominal or real units.

26
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,590
If we're discounting nominal revenue or the nominal discount

27
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,280
rate and real revenue of the real discount rate,

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,760
we should be getting exactly the same answer.

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,190
If we don't, it means we have made a mistake somewhere.
