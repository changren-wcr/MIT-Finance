00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,880
PROFESSOR: Question c: what is your expected rental revenue

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,640
next year in nominal terms?

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,770
Well, nominal revenue in year one

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,720
equals to the current revenue multiplied

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,570
by 1 plus nominal growth rate.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,070
But the question does not give us

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,420
nominal growth rate directly.

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,520
So we have to compute it.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,090
1 plus nominal growth rate equals to 1

10
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,390
plus real growth rate multiplied by the rate of inflation.

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,400
So we can use this equation to plug it into here

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,460
and, therefore, the nominal revenue year 1

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,790
is going to be equal to revenue now multiplied

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,630
by 1 plus real growth rates times 1

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,890
plus the rate of inflation.

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,300
Plugging in the numbers, we get $650,000 multiplied by 1

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,170
plus 3% multiplied by 1 plus 2.5%,

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,260
which gives us $686,237.50.

19
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,000
