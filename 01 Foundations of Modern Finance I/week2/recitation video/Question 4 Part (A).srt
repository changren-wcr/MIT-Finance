00:00:00,793 --> 00:00:02,210
PROFESSOR: In this question, we're

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,030
given a state space model that consists of three states.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,510
All three states are equally likely.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,100
The first question asks us to find the price

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,710
and expected return on asset x that

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,240
pays off $100 in the first state, $80 in the second state,

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,730
and $100 in the third state.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,217
So let's start with the price of this asset first.

9
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:27,800
So the price would equal to the payoff

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,980
that we get from this asset in state number one multiplied

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,130
by the price of the first state plus the payoff

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,100
that we get in the second state multiplied

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,480
by the price of the second state plus the payoff

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,960
that we get in the third state multiplied

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,400
by the price of the third state.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,010
This gives us $100 times 0.2 plus $80 times 0.55

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,020
plus $100 times 0.2 and gives us $84.

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,120
So the price of this asset x right now is $84.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
Now, the second part of the question

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,077
asks us to find the expected return.

21
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:06,410
To find expected return, the first thing we need to find

22
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,320
is the expected payoff that we're expecting

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,630
to get from this asset.

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,920
Let's find it.

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,820
So to find expected payoff, we are multiplying the payoffs

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,510
that we get in each of the states by their probabilities.

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,240
In this case, all three states are equally likely,

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,220
so probability of the first state is 1/3,

29
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,060
second state is 1/3 as well, and the third state is 1/3 as well.

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,340
So therefore, the expected payoff

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,280
equals to $100 multiplied by 1/3 plus $80 multiplied by 1/3

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,400
plus $100 multiplied by 1/3.

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,510
This gives us $93.33.

34
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,680
Now, to find expected the return,

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,430
we're taking this expected payoff, $93.33,

36
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,310
minus the current price of the asset divided

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,710
by the current price of this asset, which is $84.

38
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,270
So 93.33 minus 84 divided by 84--

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,630
this gives us 11.11%.

40
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,500
So the expected return on this asset x is 11.11%.

41
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,000
