00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,590
PROFESSOR: In this question, we asked,

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,540
what is our expected rental revenue in year 1,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,170
2, 3, and 4 in nominal terms?

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,640
Recall that our current revenue in year 0 is $650,000.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,210
Then the nominal revenue in year 1

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,700
equals to the current revenue multiplied

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,420
by 1 plus nominal growth rate.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,380
Now recall that the nominal growth rate equals to--

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,730
and can be found from the following equation.

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,660
So 1 plus nominal growth rate equals

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,190
to 1 plus real growth rates multiplied by 1

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,850
plus the rate of inflation.

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:52,670
Recall that the nominal growth rate equals to 3%.

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,405
And inflation in this question equals to 2.5%.

15
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:59,380


16
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:10,100
So this gives me 1.05575.

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:20,690
And from this I get the nominal growth rates of 5.575%.

18
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,830
And now this is the nominal growth rate

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,900
that we can use to find normal revenue in years 1, 2, 3,

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,850
and 4.

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,000
In year one, nominal revenue would

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:45,240
equal to $650,000 multiplied by 1 plus 5.575%.

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:55,590
And this equals to $686,237.50.

24
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,180
This number is the same as the one

25
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,370
we found in part C of this question above.

26
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:08,220
Now continuing this logic, nominal revenue in year 2

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,340
is going to be current revenue multiplied by 1

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,150
plus nominal growth rate squared, again, because we

29
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,880
receive this revenue in year 2.

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,620
And therefore, it grows for 2 years at this growth rate gn.

31
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,350
And this equals $650,000 multiplied by 1

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:38,270
plus 5.575% squared.

33
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:53,160
This equals to $724,495.24.

34
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:04,260
Nominal revenue in year 3 equals to current revenue multiplied

35
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,500
by 1 plus nominal growth rate raised to the power 3,

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,340
which again equals $650,000 multiplied

37
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:22,830
by our nominal growth rate raised the power 3.

38
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:36,240
And this equals to $764,885.85.

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,550
So finally, nominal revenue in year 4

40
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,670
would equal to the current revenue multiplied

41
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,930
by 1 plus nominal growth rate raised to the power 4.

42
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:59,160
And this equals to again $650,000 multiplied by 1 plus

43
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,490
5.575% raised to the power 4 now.

44
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:20,800
And this equals to $807,528.24.

45
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
So these numbers together give us nominal revenue

46
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,600
that we expect to receive from renting out our property in

47
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,310
years 1, 2, 3, and 4.

48
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,000
