00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:03,630
PROFESSOR: What is the expected rental revenue next year

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,450
in real terms?

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,520
Well the current revenue they just

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,710
recorded for this year that just passed is $650,000.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,880
Next year your real revenue, or revenue in real terms,

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,190
is the current revenue multiplied

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,680
by 1 plus the growth rate.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,820
Notice that this growth rate is actually the real growth rate.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,200
And so in our cases then it's $650,000,

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,910
the current revenue, multiplied by 1

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,630
plus 3%, which is our real growth

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,000
rate, which gives us $669,500.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
