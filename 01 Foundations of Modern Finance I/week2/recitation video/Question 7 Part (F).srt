1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,870
PROFESSOR: Next, let us find the present value

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,750
of your real rental revenue over the next four years.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,560
The present value would equal to the real revenue

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,379
that you receive in each of the four years discounted

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,890
to present at the real discount rate.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,040
So real revenue in year 1 divided

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:39,330
by 1 plus real discount rate, then real revenue in year 2

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,383
discounted to present, again, at the real discount rate.

9
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:45,800
So here, of course, we have to raise this to a power of 2,

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,110
because this revenue occurs in year 2.

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,300
So, therefore, this is the appropriate way

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,590
to find the present value of that exact real revenue

13
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,120
that we'll get in year 2.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:06,790
Then real revenue in year 3, divided by 1 plus real discount

15
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,370
rate raised to the power of 3.

16
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:16,330
And finally, the real revenue in year 4,

17
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,300
divided again by 1 plus r--

18
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,800
that is real discount rate, raised to power of 4.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:35,530
So putting this together, we get $669,500 divided by 1 plus 6%,

20
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:46,180
plus $689,585 divided by 1 plus 6% squared,

21
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:56,280
plus $710,272.55 divided by 1 plus 6%

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,410
raised to the power of 3.

23
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,650
And the final real revenue in year 4,

24
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:12,920
which is $731,580.73, divided by 1 plus 6%,

25
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,140
raised to power of 4.

26
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:29,870
Altogether, this gives us the present value of $2,421,171.

27
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,680
So the present value of your rental revenue

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,260
that you expect to receive over the next four years

29
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,030
is $2.4 million.

30
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,000
