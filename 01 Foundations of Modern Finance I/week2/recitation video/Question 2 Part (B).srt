00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,800
PROFESSOR: The second question asks,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,030
what is the price of the stock today?

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,039
To find the price of the stock, we again multiply the payoff

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,620
that we get from the stock in the first state,

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,290
by the state price of the first state,

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,740
plus the payoff that we get from the stock in the second state,

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,840
times the price of the second state.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,870
It's 150, multiplied by 0.35, plus $40

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,440
that we get from the stock in the second state, times 0.55.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,220
This gives us $74.50.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,500
So the price of the stock today is $74.50.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,000
