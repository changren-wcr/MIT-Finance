1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,600
PROFESSOR: In this question, we're given two options.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,700
We are offered $10,000 today or $11,500 in 1 year from now.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,670
To compare the two options, we have to compare them

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,770
at one point in time.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,600
The easiest way to do that is to compare them as of now.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,560
What is the present value of option 1,

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,660
and what is the present value of option 2?

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,310
So the present value of option 1 is trivially just the value

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,420
that we offer today.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,299
It's $10,000.

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,500
Now, the present value of option 2,

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,520
we have to find what is the present value of $11,500

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,440
that we are receiving one year from today as of now.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,490
And for that we are given an interest rates of 8%.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,880
So the present value of this payment that we receive

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,250
one year from now is $10,648.

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,350
So the present value of the second option

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,600
is greater than the present value of the first option.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,270
So therefore, we should prefer the second option.

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,920
Let's try to understand why in this question

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,170
we are preferring option 2 to option 1.

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,870
Let's look at the interest rate of 8%.

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,490
This interest rate represents our opportunity cost

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,840
of capital, which means what the rate of return we

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,130
can earn on investments that have similar risk

26
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,840
as our sister's promise.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,540
So let's consider the following hypothetical scenario.

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,200
Let's take $10,000 from our sister

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,460
today and invest it in one of the assets that

30
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,460
have similar risk and therefore gives us

31
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,520
expected rate of return of 8%.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,000
Then the future value of this investment

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,290
will be $10,000 that we invest today and 8% rate

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:04,340
that we earn at the end of this year, which gives us $10,800.

35
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,130
So in this hypothetical scenario,

36
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,160
if we take $10,000 today, at the end of the year,

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,490
we're going to get $10,800, which

38
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,670
is lower that what we were going to get from our sister, which

39
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,490
is $11,500.

40
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,460
And because these two options have the same risk

41
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,530
and one gives us more money than the other one,

42
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,050
we should be preferring the second option.
