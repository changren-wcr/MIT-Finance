PROFESSOR: The next question asks,
what is the present value of your real rental revenue
that you expect to receive next year?
To find the present value of real revenue
that we expect to get next year, we
have to discount it to present at the real discount rate.
Applied to our case, this is $669,500, which
is our real revenue that we'll get next year,
discounted to present at the 6% real discount
rate, which gives us $631,604.
