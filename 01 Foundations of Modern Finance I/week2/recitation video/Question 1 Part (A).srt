1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,270
PROFESSOR: So what is the return on this bond?

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,190
Well, let's start with the definition

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,370
of what expected return is.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,110
It is the expected payoff that we

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,810
get from this bond minus its price divided by its price.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,500
We already know the price of this bond, which is $96.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,230
So what's left to find is the expected payoff

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,320
that we get from investing into this bond.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,970
Well, the expected payoff can be found

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,750
as the probability of the first state, which

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,790
is 0.3, times the payoff that we get

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,782
from this bond in this first state, $100.

13
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:36,740
Plus the probability of the second state, which

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,350
is 0.4, times the payoff that we get

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,230
from this bond in the second state, which is $100.

16
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,920
Plus the probability of the third state, which is 0.3,

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,420
multiplied by the payoff that we get

18
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,880
from this bond in the third state, which is $100.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,247
So adding this up gives us $100.

20
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:57,830
And it's very intuitive, one to expect the payoff on this bond

21
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,930
is $100, because in each of the three states, we get $100.

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,440
So no matter which state is realized, we get exactly $100.

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,090
So therefore, the expected payoff is just $100.

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,340
So now we know the expected payoff.

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,030
We know the price of the bond.

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,010
So we put them back into the return equation.

27
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:24,230
And this gives us $100 minus $96 divided by $96,

28
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,680
and that equals 4.17%.

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,660
Note that this return of 4.17% is guaranteed.

30
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,470
Why?

31
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,980
Because there is no uncertainty in what payoff

32
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,660
we will get from holding this bond next period.

33
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,360
We're going to get $100, regardless of which state

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,220
of nature is realized.

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,150
So in this sense, this return is risk-free.

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,700
Note that in the question, we didn't ask

37
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,960
what is the expected return.

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,510
We just asked what is the return on the bond.

39
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,400
Because again, this return is guaranteed to us.
