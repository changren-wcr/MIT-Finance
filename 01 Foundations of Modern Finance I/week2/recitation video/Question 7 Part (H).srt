00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,430
PROFESSOR: The last part of this question

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,260
asks us to find the present value

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,610
of our nominal rental revenue over the next four years.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,930
Let us start this question by finding the nominal discount

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,930
rate, which we will have to use to discount

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,310
the nominal rental revenue back to present.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,740
We have already done this in part D of this question.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,660
So let me remind you.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,980
1 plus nominal discount rate equals to 1

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,900
plus real discount rate multiplied by 1

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,720
plus the rate of inflation.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,180
Recall that the real discount rate is 6%.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,150
And the rate of inflation is 2.5%.

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,970


15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:59,410
Multiplying these two quantities gives us 1.0865.

16
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,550
And therefore from this equation,

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:12,130
we obtain that the nominal discount rate equals to 8.65%.

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,900
Now we can find the present value

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,970
of our nominal rental revenue.

20
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,170
Let us start by writing down what this present value should

21
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,860
be.

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,990
Let me write it down in a more compact way.

23
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,920
So it's the sum of all nominal revenue in every year,

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,190
i, where i is going to go from 1 to 4,

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,800
discounted to present by using the nominal discount rate.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:49,180
So 1 plus r nominal, raised to the power i.

27
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,820
And so now we can expand this.

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,300
And we can use the nominal revenue

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,580
for every year 1, 2, 3, and 4 that we

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,210
found in the previous part of this question.

31
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:10,150
So the nominal revenue in year one is 686,237.50.

32
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:16,950
We're discounting this to present at 8.65%,

33
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:28,940
plus the second nominal revenue, which is $724,495.24 .

34
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,630
We're dividing it by 1 plus our nominal discount rate

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,230
8.65% raised to the power 2, again,

36
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:42,920
because this revenue occurs in year 2, plus continuing.

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:53,640
Nominal revenue in a year 3 is 764,885.85, divided by 1

38
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,270
plus 8.65% raised to the power 3,

39
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:12,500
plus the final nominal rental revenue 807,528.24 divided by 1

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:19,840
plus 8.65% raised to the power 4.

41
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:32,710
Now adding this all together gives us $2,421,171.

42
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,890
Notice that this value equals exactly the same present value

43
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:45,080
that we found in part F of this question.

44
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,290
And this is the key lesson of this exercise

45
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,185
is that the present value, whether you

46
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:56,120
are operating in nominal terms or in real terms, should equal.

47
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,210
If it doesn't, you have made a mistake somewhere

48
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,120
along the way.

49
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,000
