00:00:00,846 --> 00:00:04,900
INSTRUCTOR: What would happen if we invested the initial amount

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,530
x into the stock market and the stock market

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,390
during this time period on average produced 10.2%

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,460
annual return?

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,620
Well, the future value of this x invested at 10.2% for 20 years

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,430
would equal to x times 1 plus 10.2% raised

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,670
to the power of 20.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,100
And that would equal to 7x.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:34,390
Therefore, the initial amount of x would grow to 7 times, 7x,

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,600
over this 20-year time period.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,250
So questions A and B give us the following information.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:50,050
If we invest x at 5.65% annual rate of return over 20 years,

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,000
our wealth would grow 3 times.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,230
But if we invest it at 10.2% annual return,

15
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,740
our wealth would grow 7 times.

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,130
So therefore, relatively small differences

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,230
in annual interest rates may imply large differences

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,820
in wealth over a long time periods.
