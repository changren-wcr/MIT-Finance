1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,480
PROFESSOR: Now suppose that a real annual growth rate of 3%

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,480
will continue over the next four years.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,670
The inflation is also expected to remain

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,760
at 2.5% over the next four years.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,740
Assume that the appropriate real discount rate is 3%.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,650
What is your expected rental revenue

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,910
in year 1, 2, 3, and 4 in real terms?

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,840
Let us solve this question.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,850
We already found what is real revenue in year one, which

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,320
is our current revenue, $650,000 multiplied by 1

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:46,900
plus real growth rate, which is 3%, which gives us $669,500.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,080
Now to find real revenue in a year 2,

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,350
we're taking the current revenue in the year 0

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,310
and multiplying it by 1 plus real growth rate

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,450
gr squared, because this revenue grows

16
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,760
at this rate gr for two years.

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,600
So this is $650,000 multiplied by 1

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:26,930
plus 3% squared, which gives me $689,585.

19
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,370
Similarly, real revenue in year 3

20
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,700
equals current revenue multiplied

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,200
by 1 plus gr raised to the power of 3,

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,670
which is $650,000 multiplied by 1

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:02:01,200
plus 3% raised to the power of 3, which gives us $710,272.55.

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,110
Finally, extending this logic all the way to a year 4,

25
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,820
we get current revenue in year 0 multiplied by 1

26
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:15,270
plus real growth rate raised to the power of 4, which, again,

27
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,920
equals to $650,000 multiplied by 1

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:34,530
plus 3% raised to the power of 4, which gives me $731,580.73

29
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,650
So altogether, these numbers give us real revenue

30
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,290
in years 1, 2, 3, and 4.
