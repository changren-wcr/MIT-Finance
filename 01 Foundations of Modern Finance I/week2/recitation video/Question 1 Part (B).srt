1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,940
PROFESSOR: Now what is the expected return on the stock?

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,870
Well, again, by definition the expected return

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,500
is the expected payoff minus the price of the stock divided

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,120
by the price of the stock.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,400
Well, we need to find the expected payoff

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,790
from investing into the stock.

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,690
Well, it's going to be the probability of the first states

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,540
0.3 times the payoff that we get from the stock

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,310
in the first state, 120, plus probability of the second state

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,900
0.4, multiplied by the payoff that we

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,420
get in the second state, $75, plus the probability

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,970
of the third state, which is 0.3 times the pay that we

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,810
get from the stock in this third state, $130.

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,690
So this gives us $105, which is the expected payoff that we get

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,300
from investing into the stock.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,250
Well, the expected return is then 105 minus 80 which

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,050
current price of the stock divided

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,010
by 80, which gives us 31.25%.

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,980
So, therefore, the expected return

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,013
from investing into the stock is 31.25%.

21
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:08,000
