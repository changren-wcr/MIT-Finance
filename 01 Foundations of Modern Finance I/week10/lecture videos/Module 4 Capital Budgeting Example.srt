00:00:00,812 --> 00:00:03,700
PROFESSOR: At last, we will consider a capital budgeting

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:09,340
example that is slightly richer than the previous examples.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,820
MSW Inc. is a small manufacturing company

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,710
selling widgets.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,130
It is now considering the launch of the next generation

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,780
of widgets, Turbo-Widgets, or TW for short.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,860
The data on TW is as follows.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,770
TW was developed over the last three years

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,070
at an R&D cost of $1 million.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,430
Producing TW requires a new machine,

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,971
which costs $2 million.

12
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:44,580
The new machine lasts 15 years, with a salvage value

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,580
of $50,000 at the end.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,480
The new machine can be depreciated linearly to 0

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,320
over 10 years.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,780
TW needs to be painted.

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,010
This can be done using the excess capacity of existing

18
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,710
painting machines, which cost $30,000 to run, independent

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,950
of how much it's used.

20
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,550
Operating cost is $40,000 per year.

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,070
TW sales are expected to be $400,000 per year.

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,180
But cannibalization will reduce existing sales

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,570
of regular widgets to drop by $20,000.

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,390
Working capital is $250,000, which

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,150
can be recovered at the end of the project.

26
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:43,290
MSW's tax rate is 34%, and its cost of capital is 10%.

27
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,940
The question we want to answer is should TW be launched now?

28
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,510
Let's go down the list to identify each piece of the cash

29
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:00,100
flow for this project, its incremental cash flow.

30
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,430
The R&D expense is sunk cost.

31
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,710
It should not be included, of course.

32
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,560
CapEx of $2 million for the machine

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,710
is a cash outflow in year 0.

34
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,990
Of course, that should be included.

35
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,260
Depreciation of $2 million over 10 years--

36
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,230
that is, $0.2 million for each year from year

37
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,560
1 to 10, that's for tax purposes.

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,150
Salvage value of the machine of $50,000 in year 15

39
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,300
is an income, but fully taxable.

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,940
This is because the book value of the machine

41
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,880
already hits 0 in year 10.

42
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,630
The project should not be charged for painting.

43
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,600
The painting machine is running anyway at no additional cost.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,860
Operating costs and sales should be included, of course.

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,670
However, loss of existing sales should

46
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,850
be charged to the project against its sales.

47
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,300
Working capital is also an initial investment,

48
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,180
but recovered in year 15.

49
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,290


50
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,510
Adding up the different pieces, we then

51
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,500
have the cash flow of Turbo-Widgets from year 0

52
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,550
to 15 in $1,000.

53
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,760
In year 0, the cash flow is minus $2,000 CapEx

54
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,310
plus $250, the working capital.

55
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:36,200
That gives us minus $2,250.

56
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,710
In year 1 to 10, the cash flow is after tax profit,

57
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,600
which is $400.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,520
So sales minus $40--

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,850
that's the expenses-- minus $20.

60
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,560
That's actually the cannibalization

61
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,330
of existing sales.

62
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,590
And then times 1 minus 0.34--

63
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,490
that's the tax rate--

64
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,370
plus the tax credit from depreciation,

65
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,030
which is 200 times 0.34.

66
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,270
The sum is $292.4 thousand.

67
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,830
From year 11 to 14, there's no more depreciation, no more tax

68
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,610
credit.

69
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:20,709
The cash flow is just the after tax profit, which is $224.4.

70
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,970
In year 15, the cash flow has three pieces.

71
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:31,840
The first piece is the after tax profit, which is 224.4.

72
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,540
The second piece is the after tax salvage

73
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,230
value of the machine, which is 50 times 1 minus 0.34.

74
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,910
Because we have to pay taxes on it.

75
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,890
The third piece is the working capital recovered.

76
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:54,670
Adding them up gives a total of $507.4 thousand.

77
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,590
At the cost of capital of 10%, the NPV of Turbo-Widgets

78
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:05,660
is minus $57.6 thousand, which is negative.

79
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,780
Therefore, we should not launch it now.

80
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,390


81
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,780
This example merely illustrates some issues

82
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,870
we need to pay attention to informing cash flow

83
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,020
forecasts for a project, given its financials.
