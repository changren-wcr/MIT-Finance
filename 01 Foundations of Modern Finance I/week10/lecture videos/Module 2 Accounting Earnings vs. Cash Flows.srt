00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,730
INSTRUCTOR: What we will do next is

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,630
to go over a series of examples to demonstrate

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:12,210
how to compute a project's cash flow from its financial data.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,320
Naturally, these examples are simplified compared

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,700
to real projects, but they do provide useful illustrations

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,990
of how to come up with cash flow estimates

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,620
in various situations.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,200
For the first example is about the distinction

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,250
between accounting earnings and actual cash flows.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,280
The project we're considering is as follows.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,450
It requires a purchase of a machine for $1 million

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,010
with a life of 10 years.

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,690
The machine will generate an annual revenue of $300,000

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,970
at an operating expense of $100,000.

15
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,270
The machine can be depreciated over its lifespan

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,210
using straight-line depreciation.

17
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,280
The corporate tax rate is 40%.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,500


19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,690
The financial information on the project

20
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,420
is summarized in the table.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,610
The first column gives the year.

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,910
The second column gives the project's pre-tax accounting

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,050
earnings.

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,800
Starting from year 1, it is revenue

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,590
minus expense minus depreciation,

26
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,110
which equals 300, which is revenue

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,480
minus 100, which is expense minus 100,

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,910
which is the depreciation.

29
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:39,100
And that gives $100,000 of pre-tax earnings.

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,950
The third column gives the after-tax earnings,

31
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,080
starting from year 1.

32
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,710
That is 1 minus the tax rate times the earnings, which

33
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,810
is $60,000.

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,030
However, we should note that you would

35
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,110
be incorrect to simply discount the after-tax earnings

36
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,480
at the cost of capital to get the NPV.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,680
The reason is that the accounting earnings did not

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,030
accurately reflect the timing of the project's cash flow.

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,840
For example, the initial expenditure, or sometimes

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,410
called CapEx of $1 million on the machine

41
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,400
is not recorded as a cash flow in year 0.

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,510
Instead, it shows up in the form of depreciation

43
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,680
as part of the expense over the next 10 years.

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,340
For evaluation purposes, we cannot arbitrarily shift cash

45
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,840
flows over time without proper discounting.

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,120
In order to value the cash flows,

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,930
we have to capture the amount and timing correctly.

48
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,240
The actual cash flow from the project

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,860
is given in column 4 in the table.

50
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,300
It's computed as follows.

51
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,230
In year 0, the cash flow is minus 1 million,

52
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,240
the CapEx amount paid at that time.

53
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,970
In year 1, the after-tax cash flow

54
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,660
equals the after-tax profit plus the tax credit

55
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,520
from depreciation.

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,600
The first part equals 1 minus 0.4, the tax rate,

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,310
times the operating profit, which is 300 minus 100,

58
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,480
revenue minus expense, or $200,000.

59
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,640
This gives an after-tax profit of 120K.

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,910
The second part equals 0.4, the tax rate,

61
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:36,050
times the annual depreciation of $100,000, which gives 40K.

62
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,070
The sum of the two gives the total after-tax cash

63
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,120
flow of $160,000.

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,750
We have the same after-tax cash flow for the remaining years.

65
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,730


66
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,640
It is obvious that the actual after-tax cash

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,770
flow is quite different from the after-tax accounting earnings.

68
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,200
This could be substantial.

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,800
In fact, no matter what discount rate we use,

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,100
that this kind of value for all accounting earnings

71
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,940
will always be positive.

72
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,240
This is because accounting earnings

73
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,980
are positive for all years, 60,000 every year.

74
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,100
But if we use actual cash flows, the answer is different.

75
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,540
For high enough of a cost of capital, the NPV of the project

76
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,590
becomes negative.

77
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,370
For example, you could try a discount rate of 10%.

78
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,550


79
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,000
This example shows that accounting earnings are not

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,400
the same as actual cash flows.

81
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,870
However, if used properly, we can figure out the cash flow

82
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,410
from the accounting information.

83
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,820
Our next example focuses on taxes.

84
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,260
The project's cash flow are given in the table,

85
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,840
which are in thousand dollars.

86
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,930
Assume its tax rate is 50%.

87
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,070
The project spans from year 0, which is now, to year 5,

88
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,830
as shown in row 1.

89
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,070
It requires an initial investment of 500,

90
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,630
shown in row 2.

91
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,280
The operating profit given in the third row is 0 in year 1,

92
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,310
100 year 2, 300 in year 3, et cetera.

93
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,910
That's given in row 3.

94
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,380
Let's assume that the initial capital investment of 500

95
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,960
can be depreciated linearly over the five years to 0 at the end.

96
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,540
This then gives a depreciation of 100

97
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,710
from year 1 to year 5 in the fourth row.

98
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,150
Know that depreciation does not represent the actual cash flow,

99
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,960
but they can be used to reduce taxes.

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,870
Row 5 uses the accounting income,

101
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,440
which is the difference between operating profit

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,180
and depreciation.

103
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,310
We have minus 100 in year 1, 0 in year 2, 200 in year 3,

104
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,810
and so on.

105
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,670
As seen from the previous example,

106
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,510
this is not the actual income because depreciation is not

107
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,390
itself a cash flow.

108
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,780
Row 6 gives the tax, which is the tax

109
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,270
rate times the operating cash flow,

110
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,980
minus the tax rate times depreciation, the tax credit.

111
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,690
This also equals the tax rate times the accounting income.

112
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,320
We then have minus 50 in year 1, 0 in year 2,

113
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,690
100 in year 3, et cetera.

114
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,370
The after-tax cash flow from the project, given in row 7,

115
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,750
equals operating cash flow minus capital expenditure

116
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,940
minus the tax.

117
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,580
We then have 500 minus, for year 0, 50 for year 1,

118
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,960
100 for year 2, and so on.

119
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,830


120
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,190
There is one caveat here, however.

121
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,370
In year 1, the operating cash flow is 0,

122
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,410
and we have a tax bill of minus 50,

123
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,700
which means a tax credit of 50.

124
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,420
We won't be able to get the tax authority, why is this amount.

125
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,230
However, if the firm has other incomes

126
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,290
it needs to pay taxes on, this tax credit

127
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,100
can be used to reduce the tax bill on these incomes.

128
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,210
$1 saved is $1 earned.

129
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,020
If we can fully utilize this tax credit to save taxes,

130
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,620
it is then equivalent to generating a $50,000 cash flow.

131
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,190
This is what we assume here, for simplicity.

132
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,540
If this tax credit cannot be fully utilized in year 1,

133
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,560
we can then carry it forward to reduce taxes in the following

134
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,470
years, when there is income.

135
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,560
All we have to do, then, is to properly discount

136
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,180
the corresponding tax benefits.

137
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,710


138
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,430
If the cost of capital for this project is 10%,

139
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,270
we can then discount its cash flow after tax.

140
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,670
The NPV we got is $39,000, roughly.

141
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,440
And that's positive.

142
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,330
This example shows how we need to treat taxes carefully

143
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,850
in coming up with a project's cash flows.
