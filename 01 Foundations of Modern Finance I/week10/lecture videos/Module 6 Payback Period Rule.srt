00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,480
PROFESSOR: Although we have been advocating the NPV

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,680
rule for capital budgeting decisions, in practice,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,350
other rules are also used.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,140
We can list some of the common ones--

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,950
the payback period, internal rate of return,

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,510
sometimes also called IRR, profitability index,

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,000
sometimes also called PI, and so on.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,280
As is often the case, for the correct answer,

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,390
there's only one, while for the not so correct answers,

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,980
there are many.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,340
We will show a more extended list of these alternative rules

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,750
by the end of this lecture.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,470
Firms use these rules for various reasons.

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,900
First, they were used historically,

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,700
and habits die hard.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,840
Second, they may have worked in previous situations, often

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,990
combined with common sense and other considerations.

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,260
Third, under certain circumstances,

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,020
they do give the same answer as NPV.

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,650
But in general, they don't agree with NPV.

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,850
Therefore, it is important to note that the NPV rule

22
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,970
dominates these alternatives.

23
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,660
Nonetheless, given their presence in practice,

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,560
we will discuss some of these alternative rules,

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,140
their validity, and limitations.

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,630
The first rule we consider is based on the so-called payback

27
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,530
period of a project.

28
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,290
A project's payback period is defined as the minimum time,

29
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,960
denoted by s, such that the sum of net cash

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,160
flows from the project turns positive.

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,580
In other words, it is the time taken

32
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,910
for the sum of the projects' subsequent payoffs

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,330
to just cover the initial investment.

34
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,870
This is formally given by the equation highlighted

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,150
on this slide.

36
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,720
The capital budgeting rule based on the payback period

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,140
first specifies a threshold payback time--

38
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,890
say, t star.

39
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,200
Then for independent projects, accept all those

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,630
with payback period not exceeding the threshold.

41
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,020
For mutually exclusive projects, among the projects

42
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,320
with payback periods not exceeding the threshold,

43
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,760
accept the one with the minimum payback period.

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,200
Let's consider an example to illustrate this rule.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,460
Suppose that the payback threshold is three years,

46
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,870
and we have two projects, 1 and 2.

47
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,880
Their dollar cash flows are given in the table,

48
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,650
in thousand dollars.

49
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,970
Their payback periods are four and three years, respectively,

50
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,610
as given in the last column in the table.

51
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,720
This is easily seen.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,490
Take project one, for example.

53
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,670
The initial investment is 100 in year zero.

54
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,580
Positive payoff starts at 20 in year one, then 40 in year two,

55
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,960
with the sum being 60; then 30 in year three,

56
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,280
with the sum being 90; and then 10 in year four,

57
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,370
with the sum being 100, which just

58
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,800
equals the initial investment.

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,220
Therefore, its payback period is four years.

60
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,910


61
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,550
With the cutoff payback period being three,

62
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,780
the firm will reject project one and accept project two.

63
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,080
But looking at the two projects more carefully,

64
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,410
and what the payback period does,

65
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,690
it has two obvious shortcomings.

66
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,420
First, the rule ignores cash flows

67
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,250
after that payback period.

68
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,480
For example, project one has substantial cash flows

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,270
in year five and six which are totally

70
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,150
ignored in the decision.

71
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,570
Second, the rule ignores discounting.

72
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,620
Both of these omissions can lead to deviations

73
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,550
from the optimal decision.

74
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,210
To see this, let's assume that the proper discount

75
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,210
rate is 10% for both projects.

76
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,030
We can then compute their NPVs.

77
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:41,270
In particular, project one has an NPV of roughly $39,000,

78
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,610
while project two has an NPV of roughly minus $7,000.

79
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,730
But by the payback rule, project two

80
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,730
was accepted, not project 1.

81
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,000
One can think of possible fixes to overcome

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,190
the rule's shortcomings.

83
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,700
For example, incorporating proper discounting,

84
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,940
one can define the discounted payback period

85
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,190
as the time it takes for the sum of the discounted cash flow

86
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,040
first exceeds the initial investment.

87
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,450
This is better than before, but still ignores the cash flows

88
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,190
after the discounted payback period.
