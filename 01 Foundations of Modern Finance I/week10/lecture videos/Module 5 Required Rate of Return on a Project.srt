00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,080
PROFESSOR: Given a project's cash flow forecasts,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,960
all we need are the corresponding discount

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,750
rates to compute the NPV.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,480
For the discount rates, we have learned the following.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,120
First, the project's discount rate,

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,660
which is also called the required rate of return

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,290
or the cost of capital, is the expected rate

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,480
of return demanded by investors in the market for the project

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,330
and for similar traded assets.

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,470
Second, discount rate depends on the timing and risk

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,060
of the cash flow.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,750
Thus, in general, it can be different for different pieces

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,080
of a cash flow.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,130
Third, discount rate is in general different for different

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,960
projects.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,700
Fourth, it is in general incorrect to use

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,640
a company-wide cost of capital to discount

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,850
cash flows of all projects.

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,180
The cost of capital is project-specific

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,015
and can vary substantially across different projects

21
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:07,890
with different risks.

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,630


23
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,180
What is the discount rate of a project?

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,120
In the simple case, a single discount rate

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,240
can be used for all cash flows of a project.

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,700
This is mostly an approximation.

27
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,790
In the general case, we need to use different discount

28
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,000
rates for different cash flows depending

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,210
on their timing and risk.

30
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,120
For example, even with safe cash flows, $1 in different years

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,090
should be discounted at different interest rates

32
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,400
if the term structure of interest rates

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,480
is not flat, as we have learned from the fixed income market.

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,170
We will return to the determination of discount rates

35
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,670
later by applying the risk analysis and asset pricing

36
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,490
tools we have been developing.

37
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,660
But in this lecture, we will use a single discount rate mainly

38
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,910
for simplicity.

39
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,750
Often, we face multiple projects.

40
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,810
As a firm, there are almost unlimited number

41
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,150
of projects it can take.

42
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,000
The key is to find the good ones--

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,170
namely, those with positive NPVs.

44
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,720
For mutually independent projects,

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,690
we can simply apply the NPV rule to each project.

46
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,350
This implies that we would take up all the projects

47
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,060
with positive NPVs.

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,600
For projects dependent of each other--

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,570
in particular, mutually exclusive--

50
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,100
we then have to compare the NPVs and pick the highest one,

51
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,590
assuming it is positive.

52
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,550
To illustrate this point, let's consider a simple example.

53
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,060


54
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,720
You have just developed a new product.

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,130
The decision now is when to bring it to the market--

56
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,890
say, in year one, two, three, or four.

57
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,390
If we view each choice as the project itself,

58
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,380
then the timing decision is between a set

59
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,180
of mutually exclusive projects.

60
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,990


61
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,930
We can launch the project only once.

62
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,130


63
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,420
Several factors can influence the cash flow forecasts

64
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,580
and the timing decision.

65
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,360
For example, the demand for the product may increase over time.

66
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,080
In addition, launching it early will also

67
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,510
cause your competitors to catch up sooner.

68
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,110
Let's assume the opportunity cost of capital for the project

69
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,420
is 10%.

70
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,740
We can compute the NPV for each launching date

71
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,570
at the time of launch.

72
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:12,610
We denote this by FPV, the project's future present value.

73
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,360
The numbers are reported in the table.

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,890
If launched in year one, the NPV then is $100 million.

75
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:27,350
If instead launched in year two, three, and four,

76
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:34,760
the FPV will be $120, $138, and $149 million

77
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,190
respectively as shown by row two to five in the table.

78
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,050
Clearly, by waiting, the FPV increases.

79
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,760
But how long should we wait?

80
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,070
There are two ways to resolve this.

81
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,180
First, we can consider the rate of return by waiting.

82
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,800
If we wait until year two, the value appreciates by 20%

83
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,550
as shown in the third column of the table.

84
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,010
If we wait longer, the return will be 15% and 8%

85
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,300
respectively.

86
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,800
Are these good returns?

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,650
Well, keep in mind that by waiting,

88
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,080
we are holding the project as an asset with its risks.

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,990
We also know the cost of capital is

90
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:34,080
10%, which is the return on similar assets in the market.

91
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,710
Therefore, waiting is desirable only

92
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,510
if it yields a return higher than the cost of capital.

93
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,990
Column three shows that the return from waiting

94
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,790
is higher than 10% until year three,

95
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,090
while waiting from year three to year four is only 8%

96
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,280
lower than the cost of capital.

97
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,040
This gives us the optimal time to launch the project, which

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,760
is year three.

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,680


100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,950
Second, we can also compare by discounting

101
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,860
the FPV of different options back

102
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,760
to year zero at the cost of capital of 10%.

103
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,170
That is, to compare the NPV now.

104
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,140
Column four gives the numbers.

105
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:28,520
Clearly, launching in year three gives the highest NPV today.

106
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,590
Other than being mutually exclusive,

107
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,350
projects can be dependent in other ways, such as sequential.

108
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,750
That is, project B is contingent on project A.

109
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,330
For example, selling advertisement

110
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,960
through a social network is contingent on building

111
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,300
the network first.

112
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,390
Such a dependence is what we called strategic options

113
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,550
earlier.

114
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,330
We will return to this topic later in part two

115
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,550
after developing a better understanding

116
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,040
on options and effective tools to value them.
