00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,750
PROFESSOR: Before we finish our introductory discussion

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,370
on capital budgeting, there are a few additional points

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,000
we would like to make.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,080
The first point is our cash flow forecasts.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,220
The precision of these forecasts is less of a concern,

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,470
except that it may reflect the risk of future cash flows.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,310
What is more important is to do our best

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,650
to avoid any systematic biases in the forecasts.

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,820
Leaving aside intended biases managers may have,

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,720
there can be honest mistakes or missed factors.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,370
One example is the response of competitors.

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,450
If a project is very profitable, such as a new product

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,830
or a new business model, it is easy to think that the profit

14
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,850
will continue for a while.

15
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,720
But the fact is a more profitable project

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,940
will more likely attract imitators.

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,870
They will cut into the project's future cash flows.

18
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,080
Underestimating future competition

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,440
can lead to overly optimistic cash flow forecasts.

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,360


21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,050
Next, in our analysis, we have said

22
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,800
that a firm should take on all the independent projects

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,030
with positive NPVs.

24
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,160
This requires that the firm does not face any constraints

25
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,990
in doing so.

26
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,790
One possible constraint is the amount of capital available.

27
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,600
With a well-functioning market, this should not be a problem.

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,540
The firm can always raise capital

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:56,360
if it has good projects also recognized by the market.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,770
In reality, however, there could be deviations.

31
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,610
Since large public companies have easy access

32
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,910
to the financial market, capital is rarely

33
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,020
a constraint, except in unusual circumstances,

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,090
such as severe information asymmetry or financial crisis.

35
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,370
For small firms, the access to financial market can be costly.

36
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,730
This may impose a soft constraint

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,760
on capital, therefore, the firm's ability

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,230
to take on more projects.

39
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,100
But the truth of the matter is that good projects

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,900
are more scarce than capital.

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,680


42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,630
There are, however, situations in which capital

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,340
constraint can be more real.

44
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,010
One example is capital allocation within a firm.

45
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,200
A division inside a firm does not have direct access

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,370
to the financial market.

47
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,690
Its capital is often provided by the firm's headquarters.

48
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,270
At a given time, the division may only

49
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,110
have a fixed amount of capital at its disposal.

50
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,810
Such a situation is also called capital rationing.

51
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,380
What do we do, then, with capital rationing?

52
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,170
The answer is fairly straightforward.

53
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,730
Let's think this over.

54
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,140
Suppose that we have N independent projects.

55
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,730
They all have positive NPVs.

56
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,350
For each project I, let its initial investment

57
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:49,670
be I subscript I, its NPV be NPV subscript I, which

58
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,300
is assumed to be positive.

59
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,490
Let the total amount of capital available

60
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,930
be capital I. What we should do is

61
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,440
to choose the set of projects such

62
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,750
that first the total investment is no greater than capital

63
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,960
I, the total amount of capital allocated to us, and two,

64
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,095
maximizes the total NPV.

65
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:18,910


66
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,290
The last point we want to make is a more general one.

67
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,160
Our analysis focuses on the computation

68
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,450
of a project's NPV given its cash flow forecasts

69
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,240
and the discount rates.

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,220
We did not talk about where these projects come from.

71
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,450
Presumably, they come from the business opportunities

72
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,950
the firm explores-- that is, the real side of the firm.

73
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,150
What finance does is to evaluate them when they show up.

74
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,480
If we find positive NPV for a project,

75
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,260
it will be a bit too simplistic to just go ahead

76
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,440
with the number.

77
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,440
There are additional questions we should ask.

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,130
For example, are our assumptions reasonable?

79
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,610
How robust is our answer?

80
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,660
But more importantly, we should think hard about where

81
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,660
the project's value comes from.

82
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,040
For example, is it from the firm's short-run competitive

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,430
advantage--

84
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,870
for example, at the right place and the right time--

85
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,530
or is it form long-term competitive advantage,

86
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,020
such as pattern, technology, brand, economy of scale,

87
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,020
et cetera?

88
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,470
Or is it just noise, like pure luck, such as finding $100 bill

89
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,570
on the sidewalk?

90
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,930
It's a positive NPV project to pick it up,

91
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,990
but you're probably not going to be spending a lot of time

92
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,120
on the sidewalk hoping to find another $100 bill.

93
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,950
Our analysis will be more complete and reliable

94
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,610
if we know better about the source of value

95
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,790
from a positive NPV project.

96
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,850
Just having a positive number for NPV

97
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,430
without knowing what is behind it

98
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,930
is far from being sufficient.
