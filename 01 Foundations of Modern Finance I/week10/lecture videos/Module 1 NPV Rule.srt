1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,330
PROFESSOR: We now focus on a firm's capital budgeting

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,070
decisions.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,900
The objective is to increase the firm's current market value.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,650
The decision depends on the valuation of each project

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,300
under consideration.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,060
Consider a project with cash flow from now to year t.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:28,090
Let's cf0 be the initial cash flow and cf1 to cft

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,290
be its expected future cash flows.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,340
Let the discount rate be r1 to rt for the corresponding cash

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,200
flows.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
The NPV of the project is then given

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,940
by the following discounted cash flow formula.

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,530
It is simply the sum of the present values of all

14
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,550
the pieces in the cash flow.

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,090
This gives the increase in the firm's current market

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,660
value if the project is taken.

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,390


18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,780
With the NPV of each project available to the firm,

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,060
we can easily write down the decision rule on investments

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,850
or capital budgeting.

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,970
For a single project, take it only if its NPV is positive.

22
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,610
For multiple independent projects,

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,450
take all those with positive NPVs.

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,960
Here, independent means the projects

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,840
are unrelated to each other.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,510
An example of independent projects

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,800
is to develop condos in far apart cities.

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,640
For mutually exclusive projects, take the one

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,400
with positive and the highest MPV.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,030
Here, mutually exclusive means we can only do one.

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,810
An example of mutually exclusive projects

32
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,620
is when to build the same condo--

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,140
right now, next year, or later.

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,199
Now, all we need to do is to compute the project's NPV.

35
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,710
This requires three inputs.

36
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,260
First, its cash flow--

37
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,100
more precisely, its expected cash flow.

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,690
Second, the right discount rates for the cash flow.

39
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,550
Third, strategic options embedded in the project

40
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,350
beyond the basic casual forecasts.

41
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,120
We will focus merely on one here and return to two and three

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,270
later in part two of the course.

43
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,390
Before we get into the details of figuring out

44
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,620
the cash flow of the project, several general points

45
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,110
are worth mentioning.

46
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,770
First, for valuation purposes, we

47
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,250
need to use actual cash flows, not accounting earnings.

48
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,100
Although we often rely on accounting information

49
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,890
to learn about a project's cash flow,

50
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,650
we have to do so carefully.

51
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,610
Earnings reported in accounting statements

52
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,560
follow certain accounting rules which

53
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,530
may not adhere to the actual timing of the cash flow.

54
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,780
As we already know, timing is a key element in valuation

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,350
and needs to be captured accurately.

56
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,400
We will see examples on this point soon.

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,180
Second, use after tax cash flows.

58
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,900
We have already made this point when we first discussed

59
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,450
the present value calculation.

60
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,270
Shareholders or investors only care

61
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:51,360
about the cash flow they actually receive after taxes.

62
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
In the corporate finance context,

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,915
firms do have to pay corporate taxes.

64
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:58,470


65
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,840
Third, it is important that we only

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,950
include cash flows attributable to the project.

67
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,100
This will then give us the net gain

68
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,510
from the project in firm value.

69
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,690
This leads to various implications

70
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,870
when computing a project's cash flows.

71
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,890
Here, we list a few.

72
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,760
One, use incremental cash flows.

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,450
There's no need to include unrelated cash flows

74
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,850
since we only care about the net value added by the project.

75
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,040
Two, ignore sunk costs.

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,590
These are cash flows associated with previous decisions,

77
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,240
not the current decision, which is

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,210
about the current and future cash flows.

79
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,300
Let the bygones be bygones, as people say.

80
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,700
Third, include investments in working capital.

81
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,710
Fourth, include opportunity cost of using existing facility,

82
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,890
losing existing cells, and so on.

83
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,330
We can go on, but instead of talking about these points

84
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,910
in abstract, we will illustrate them through a set of examples.

85
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,290
Before doing so, we want to give a formal definition

86
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,810
of a project's cash flow, which is given

87
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,840
by the equation on this slide.

88
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,740
The net cash flow equals cash inflow minus cash outflow.

89
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,700
The project's cash inflow is simply its operating revenue.

90
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,410
The outflow, however, consists of three pieces.

91
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:50,200
First, operating expenses without depreciation.

92
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,540
Second, taxes.

93
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,940
And last, capital expenditures.

94
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,200
This is summarized in the second equation.

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,560
We can also rewrite a project's cash flow

96
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,600
in a slightly different way.

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,260
First, we define the project's operating profit

98
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,880
as its operating revenue net of operating expenses

99
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,830
without depreciation again.

100
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,920
Next, we consider taxes.

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,070
Let the project's effective tax rate be tau.

102
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,500
Then the projects income tax will

103
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,360
be the tax rate tau times the operating profit then

104
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,390
minus the tax rate times the depreciation.

105
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,020
This second term comes from the tax credit

106
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,860
the firm can claim from its capital investments.

107
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,820
Here, we note that accounting depreciation

108
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,960
itself is not a cash flow, but it does affect the project's

109
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,290
after tax cash flow because it can be used

110
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,240
to reduce the firm's tax bill.

111
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,770


112
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,460
Putting things together, we have the following.

113
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,190
The net cash flow of the project equals 1 minus tau

114
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,320
times the operating profit, which

115
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,890
is the after tax profit, minus capital expenditure

116
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,470
plus the tax credit from depreciation.
