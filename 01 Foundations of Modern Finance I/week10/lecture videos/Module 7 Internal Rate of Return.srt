1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,650
PROFESSOR: The next rule we consider

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:07,495
is based on the internal rate of return, or IRR.

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:11,560
A project's IRR is defined as the number

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
that gives a zero if used to discount

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,680
all the project's cash flows.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,650
Mathematically, it is defined by the equation on this slide.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,490
Clearly, IRR, if it exists, is solely

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,460
determined by the project's cash flow.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,000
We don't need any other information.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,750
The decision rule based on IRR is as follows.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:44,020
First, a threshold rate or a hurdle rate, IRR star, is set.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,350
Then, for independent projects, accept

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,650
all the projects with IRR greater

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,610
than the hurdle rate, IRR star.

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,240
For mutually exclusive projects, among the projects with IRRs

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,550
greater than the hurdle rate, accept

17
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,459
the one with the highest IRR.

18
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:10,340
Let's consider an example to illustrate the use of IRR rule.

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,450
Again, consider two projects, 1 and 2, with cash flows

20
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,360
given in the table on the slide.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
These are the same two projects considered

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,770
for the payback rule.

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,700
We can find their IRRs through numerical solutions.

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,780
As it turns out, project 1 has an IRR of 21%,

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,410
and project 2 has an IRR of 7%.

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,120
At a hurdle rate of 10%, say, only project 1

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,620
will be accepted.

28
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:48,960
This is the same choice as from the NPV rule as we saw earlier.

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,160
Although IRR is widely used in practice,

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,800
there's no guarantee that it gives the right answer.

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,640
The IRR rule leads to the same decision as the NPV rule

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,500
when the following conditions are met.

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,380
First, cash outflow occurs only at time 0.

34
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,510
Or more generally, cash flow changes side only once.

35
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,230
Second, only one project is under consideration.

36
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,160
Using IRR to rank projects is problematic,

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,680
as we'll see in a minute.

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,080
Third, opportunity cost of capital

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,060
is the same for all periods.

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,700
From the definition of IRR, It is

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,230
used to discount cash flows for all different periods.

42
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,610
As we said before, in general, cash flows at different times

43
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,800
should be discounted at different rates,

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,630
according to their timing and risk.

45
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,960
Fourth, the hurdle rate is set to be the same

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,970
as the cost of capital.

47
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,190
Since IRR is determined solely by a project's cash flow,

48
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,160
some people argue that it is easy to use

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,330
because it requires no finance expertise, which

50
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,640
is about discount rates.

51
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,100
But this is not quite right.

52
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,210
Even with IRR, the rule relies on the right hurdle rate.

53
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,620
Given the popularity of IRR rule in practice,

54
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,070
we want to point out some potential issues in its use.

55
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,490
We start from the more technical ones,

56
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,790
and then move on to the more serious ones.

57
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,490
First, given the project's cash flow,

58
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,550
there may not exist an IRR.

59
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,940
Sometimes there may be more than one IRR.

60
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,920
We show this with two examples.

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480


62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,910
The table on the top left of the slide

63
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,610
gives the cash flow of a project.

64
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,010
The figure on the top right plots

65
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,970
the discounted value of the cash flow at an arbitrary discount

66
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,180
rate, r.

67
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,550
An IRR is given by the point where

68
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:09,050
the cash flow's discounted value curve crosses the x-axis.

69
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,900
Clearly, in this case the curve never reaches

70
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,550
the x-axis, implying no solution for the IRR.

71
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,660
The table on the bottom left gives another cash flow

72
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,330
and the figure on the right plots the cash flow's

73
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,220
discounted value curve.

74
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,760
Here, the curve crosses the x-axis at two places.

75
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:38,670
One is between 0 and 0.05, and another between 0.1 and 0.15.

76
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,130
Which one should we pick, then, in this case?

77
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,020
No obvious answer.

78
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,100
Obviously, in these two cases the project's cash flow

79
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,870
changes side twice, violating one of the conditions needed

80
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,780
for IRR to work.

81
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,780
Next, we show that IRR cannot be used to rank projects when

82
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,250
choosing between them.

83
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,920
We show this with an example.

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,830
The example describes two projects, 1 and 2.

85
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,600
The cash flows are given in the table on the slide,

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,850
in row 2 and 3.

87
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:21,050
Column 3 gives their IRRs 100% and 80%, respectively.

88
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,470
Suppose the hurdle rate is 10% the cost

89
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,170
of capital for these projects.

90
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,860
Then both projects pass the hurdle.

91
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,700
If they are mutually independent, we will do both.

92
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,120
However, if these two projects are mutually exclusive,

93
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,450
we have to choose one between them.

94
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:48,330
Clearly, then, project 1 wins because it has a higher IRR.

95
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,840
If we compute their NPVs at the cost of capital

96
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,970
of 10%, which I give it in the last column in the table, then

97
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:03,230
project 2 should be taken because it has a higher NPV.

98
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,740
What's going on here?

99
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,740
Well, if we look at the two cash flows more carefully,

100
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,565
we'll notice that project 2 is a bigger project with larger cash

101
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:14,840
flows.

102
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,720
Even though it has a smaller IRR,

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,830
its larger scale leads to a larger NPV.

104
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,760
Given that we want to maximize the total market value,

105
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,020
project 2 clearly delivers more.

106
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,310
What we learn is that IRR, being a rate itself,

107
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,560
does not capture the scale of the project.

108
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,370
Therefore, you will miss the scale factor

109
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,830
when it's used to rank projects which

110
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,760
may well have different scales.
