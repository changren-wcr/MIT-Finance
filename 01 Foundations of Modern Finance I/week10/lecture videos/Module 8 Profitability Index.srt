00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,020
PROFESSOR: The last rule we're going to consider

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,750
is based on a project measure called

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,930
profitability index, or PI.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,530
The PI of a project is defined as the ratio

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,920
between the present value of its future cash flows

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,210
by its initial investment.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,010
Formally, it's given by the equation on this slide.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,910
The decision rule based on PI is as follows.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,540
For independent projects, accept all with PI greater than 1.

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,660
For mutually exclusive projects, among those

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:42,050
with PI greater than 1, choose the one with the highest PI.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,270
However, PI suffers the same drawback as IRR

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,990
in comparing projects with different scales.

14
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,800
In fact, by normalizing the present value of future cash

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,340
flows by the initial investment, PI

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,880
is intent at removing the scale factor.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,360
Obviously, scale matters for value creation.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,160
More is better.

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,230
The example on the slide further illustrates this point.

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,110
For the sake of time, we will skip it here.

21
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,490
But you are more than welcome to go over it yourself.

22
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,060
To wrap up our discussion on the alternative rules in capital

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,330
budgeting, we briefly present the results

24
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,330
from a survey of CFOs from a broad set of companies.

25
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,820
The figure on the slide shows the percentage

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,680
of CFOs surveyed who use a particular capital budgeting

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,740
rule.

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,750
The y-axis lists the rules used, and the x-axis

29
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,920
gives the percentage of CFOs always or mostly

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,830
always use that rule.

31
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,680
Here a few observations from the data.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,100
First, there's a long list of rules being used.

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,000
We live in the rich world.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,680
Second, NPV and IRR are on top of the list in terms of usage.

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,990
It is indeed the case that IRR has

36
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,780
been around longer than NPV.

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,580
Payback is quite popular as well, despite its drawbacks.

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,480
And PI is on the list too, but towards the bottom,

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,390
despite its wider validity, except for comparing projects.

40
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,550
Third, if we add up the percentage

41
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,460
of all the rules on the list, it way exceeds 100%.

42
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,430
This means that multiple rules are often

43
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,070
used at the same time.

44
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,110
There could be a range of possibilities

45
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,120
for why this is the case.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,120
At one end, don't know which one to use and just

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,710
throw a bunch at it.

48
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,490
At the other end, use several rules to complement each other

49
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,760
and to arrive at a more robust answer.

50
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,500
Hopefully, the latter is more often the case.
