00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,050
PROFESSOR: A project's cash flows

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,200
can arise in different accounting forms.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,050
One of them is change in inventory.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,820
Let's consider a simple example.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,640
Suppose that you are running a chain of shoe stores.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,710
The financials are as follows.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,380
This quarter, you buy 1 million pairs

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,940
of shoes at a price of $30 each.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,400
You expect to sell all of them in the next two

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,380
quarters, 500,000 per quarter at a price of $60.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,520
The effective tax rate is 40%.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,865
What are the cash flows for this project?

13
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:43,700


14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,300
The financial data are summarized in the table.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,690
The first column is time in quarters.

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,620
The second column gives the after tax accounting profit.

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,350
In quarter 0, it's $0.

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,260
In quarter 1, the accounting profit

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,140
is sales, which is $0.5 million times profit margin, which

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,490
is $60 minus $30, the sale price minus costs

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,890
for each pair of shoes then times 1 minus the tax rate.

22
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,140
This gives an after tax accounting profit of $9 million

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,080
per quarter.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,670
But this is not the actual after tax cash rule.

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,050
In particular, the cost of shoes are paid in quarter 0

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,950
in the form of inventory, not in quarter 1 and 2.

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,490


28
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,910
There are different ways to deal with this issue.

29
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,260
One way is to directly go after the project's cash flow, which

30
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,660
is given in the last column in a table.

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,570
In particular, in quarter 0, we paid a total of $30 million

32
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:03,480
for an inventory of 1 million pairs of shoes at $30 a pair.

33
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,590
This is a cash flow of minus $30 million.

34
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,300
In quarter 1, the revenue is 0.5 million pairs

35
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,540
of shoes sold times the sales price of $60.

36
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,150
That gives us $30 million.

37
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,190
The tax bill is operating profit,

38
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,140
which is 0.5 million times $60 minus $30,

39
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,780
times the tax rate of 40%, which gives $6 million.

40
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,800
Net of the two items gives an after tax cash flow

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,080
of $24 million.

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,810
It's repeated in quarter 2.

43
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,230
Another way is to look also at the inventory, which is

44
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,240
given in column 3 in the table.

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,580
Since inventory carries a price, its change

46
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,150
implies a cash flow-- in particular,

47
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,810
a change in inventory implies an opposite cash flow

48
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,730
of the same amount.

49
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,970
Therefore, for quarter 0, inventory

50
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,550
increases by $30 million.

51
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,620
It implies a cash flow of minus $30 million, the amount of cash

52
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,050
paid for that inventory.

53
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,280
For quarter 1 and 2, inventory decreases by $15 million

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,020
respectively.

55
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,010
Yet that implies a cash flow of plus $15 million,

56
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,420
the amount recouped from selling the inventory.

57
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,470
If we add these implied cash flows to the after tax

58
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,870
accounting profit, the cash flow will be 0 minus $30 million.

59
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,040
That equals minus $30 million in quarter 0.

60
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,790
$9 plus $15, which equals $24 million

61
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,940
in quarter 1 and quarter 2.

62
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,020
This is the same as what we have obtained previously

63
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,780
in the last column.

64
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,770
From this, we see that with changing inventory,

65
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,840
a project's cash flow can also be computed as its after tax

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,580
accounting profit minus the change in inventory,

67
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,800
which is given in the equation at the bottom of the slide.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,170
In general, there are timing differences

69
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,200
between the accounting measure of earnings or profit,

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,910
which is given by sales minus cost of goods sold

71
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,530
and the actual cash flows.

72
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,360
This is specifically reflected in changes in working capital,

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,860
which includes several parts.

74
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,630
A simple definition of working capital is as follows.

75
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,460
It equals inventory plus accounts receivable

76
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,680
minus accounts payable.

77
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,450
As we have seen from the previous example,

78
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,560
changes in working capital such as inventory

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,930
implied actual cash flows.

80
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,550
Let's consider this in more detail.

81
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,900
First, inventory.

82
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,310
In computing earnings and profits, the cost of goods sold

83
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,870
includes the cost of items sold in that period.

84
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,970
The actual cost of these items may occur in different periods.

85
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,930
When inventory is rising, the cost of goods sold

86
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,020
understates the cash outflows.

87
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,500
When inventory is falling, the cost of goods sold

88
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,270
overstates the cash outflows.

89
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,360
The second item is accounts receivable.

90
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,940
Accounting sales may include sales

91
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,430
that have not been paid for, which

92
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,370
goes into accounts receivable.

93
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,450
Therefore, accounting sales understate cash inflows

94
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,050
if the firm is receiving payments from past sales.

95
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,720
This corresponds to decreases in accounts receivable.

96
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,310
The third item in working capital is accounts payable.

97
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:06,190
Conceptually, this is just the reverse of accounts receivable.

98
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,010
Therefore, with changing working capital,

99
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,710
the after tax cash flow of a project

100
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,850
needs to include an additional term, which is minus

101
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,850
the change in working capital as shown

102
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,780
in the equation on this slide.
