1
00:00:00,677 --> 00:00:02,760
PROFESSOR: Let's reconsider the restaurant project

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,920
we studied in question one.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,750
Suppose that to run the restaurant

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,070
you need $190,000 each year in net working capital.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,020
This working capital consists of food and beverage stock

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,300
and the associated supply chain needed

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,610
to produce and serve meals.

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,640
You're required to make this investment in the year zero.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,980
In the year 10, you expect to close

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,130
the restaurant, at which point the net working capital will

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,750
go down to $0.

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,650
Does this change your decision on

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,490
whether you should open this restaurant or not?

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,300
Let's set net working capital requirements to the restaurant

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,990
project we considered in question one.

16
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,020
To run this restaurant, we're required

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,180
to have $190,000 in net working capital each year,

18
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,570
starting in the year zero and ending in year nine.

19
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,900
In year zero, we will close the restaurant,

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,860
and the working capital will go down to zero.

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,150
Let's start by adding these requirements to line six

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,590
in the spreadsheet.

23
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,170
In year zero, we're required to have $190,000

24
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,565
in net working capital.

25
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:17,980
These requirements are the same all the way through year nine,

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,220
and in the year 10, since we're closing down the restaurant,

27
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,750
the working capital goes down to $0.

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,690
Next, we compute the year-over-year changes

29
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,570
in net working capital.

30
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,450
So in year zero-- we'll assume that before year zero

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,610
we had nothing in net working capital,

32
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,675
so therefore, since the requirements in year zero

33
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:49,990
are $190,000, our increase is $190,000 in year zero.

34
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,800
In subsequent years, we're computing the increases

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,450
by taking the difference between this year

36
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,512
and the previous year, so for example, in year one,

37
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:03,970
the increase in net working capital

38
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,340
is $0 because the net working capital

39
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,240
requirements are the same in the year zero and the year one.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,950


41
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,000
So the increase will be $0 all the way through year nine,

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,870
and in the year 10, the working capital

43
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:27,380
is going to decrease by $190,000 because the net working capital

44
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,440
requirements in the year 10 are $0.

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,200
And in the year nine, they were $190,000,

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,420
so therefore the net working capital

47
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:43,090
decreased by $190,000 between the year nine and 10.

48
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,830
Now in line eight, I will use the definition

49
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,360
of after-tax cash flow to compute after-tax cash flows

50
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,260
every year.

51
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,630
By definition, it is 1 minus tax rate--

52
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,210
recall that the tax rate is 21%--

53
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:11,750
multiplied by operating profit minus capital expenditures

54
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,860
plus depreciation tax shield, which is computed by tax rate

55
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:24,140
multiplied by depreciation expense minus increase

56
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,290
in net working capital.

57
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:43,390
And so in year zero, the cash flows are negative $840,000.

58
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,770
In all of the subsequent years, these

59
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,810
are the after-tax cash flows.

60
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,900
Note that in years one through year nine

61
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,450
the after-tax cash flows are exactly the same

62
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,030
as we had in question one.

63
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,600
In the year 10, however, the after-tax cash flow

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,200
is higher by $190,000, so this is

65
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,340
the amount of the decrease in net working capital.

66
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,990
As the final step, I will compute the net present value

67
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,820
of this restaurant project, and we'll use the NPV function.

68
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,400
I used the cost of capital, cash flows from year one

69
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,260
through year 10, and I'm adding up the after-tax cash

70
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,400
flow in year zero.

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:45,160
And the net present value is negative $3,284.

72
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,100
Turns out, net working capital requirements

73
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,190
make the NPV of this project negative,

74
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,910
and therefore we should not open this restaurant.

75
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,230
Conceptually, it is the timing of cash flows associated

76
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,540
with the working capital that makes

77
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,280
such a significant difference in this case.

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,970
We're required to spend additional $190,000

79
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:18,360
in year zero, which we only get back in year 10.

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,440
Given the discount rate of 10%, the time value of $190,000

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,040
is significant enough to turn the NPV of this project

82
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,890
negative.

83
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,000
