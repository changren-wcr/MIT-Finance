1
00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:01,870
PROFESSOR: Consider a project that

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,200
requires an investment of $30,000 in Year 0.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,900
This project is expected to generate

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,590
cash flows of $4,600 over the next 10 years.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,793
What is the internal rate of return, or IRR,

6
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:18,460
of this project?

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,520


8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,020
First, let's learn how to build an NPV profile for a given

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,280
project.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,570
By definition, NPV profile is a graph

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:37,540
of a project's NPV over a range of discount rates.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,828
In our case, if the discount rate is r,

13
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:42,370
the net present value of this project

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,010
is negative $30,000, which is the initial investment,

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,400
plus $4,600 divided by r, multiplied by 1 minus 1

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,480
divided by 1 plus r raised to the power 10.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,580
Here we are using the formula that

18
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,920
computes the present value of an annuity that

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,240
pays $4,600 each year for 10 years starting in Year 1.

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,890
Now let's use Excel to compute this NPV for a range

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,660
of discount rates, r.

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,490
In the spreadsheet, I have built in an array of discount rates

23
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:32,630
starting from 0.25% all the way to 15% with increments

24
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,910
of a quarter of a percent.

25
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,200
Now, for each of these discount rates,

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,790
I will compute the net present value of our project.

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,840
So starting for 0.25%, the net present value

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,950
equals to the initial investment plus annual cash flow divided

29
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:58,220
by this discount rate multiplied by 1 minus 1 divided by 1

30
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,227
plus discount rate raised to the power 10.

31
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:05,970


32
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,150
So in this case, if the discount rate is 0.25%,

33
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:16,510
the net present value of our project is $15,374.

34
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,130
Now, let me fix the cells, B3 and B4,

35
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,470
so that I can stretch this array all the way down.

36
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,710
And it'll automatically compute the net present value

37
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,910
of this project for all of these discount rates.

38
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,340


39
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,820
Now, recall that by definition, NPV profile

40
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,600
is a graph of a project's NPV for a range of discount rates.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,250
So let's plot NPV against discount rates.

42
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,900
I am going to select both arrays and build this graph.

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:01,380


44
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,090
What we see is that for this project,

45
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,950
the NPV profile is a convex downward-sloping line.

46
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:18,720
It intersects x-axis around 8.75% mark.

47
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,140
Recall that by definition, the internal rate of return,

48
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,120
or IRR, is the discount rate that makes NPV of the project

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,010
equal to 0.

50
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,150
Therefore, the major benefit of building the NPV profile

51
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,870
is to gauge what the internal rate of return for a given

52
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,880
project is.

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,790
In our case, internal rate of return

54
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,620
is somewhere around 8.75%.

55
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,000
Note that this is not the exact solution yet.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,580
We will learn two ways of finding

57
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,460
the exact solution for the internal rate of return now.

58
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,040
The first method of finding the internal rate of return

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,310
is to use Goal Seek function in Excel.

60
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,580
This function numerically solves equations.

61
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,400
To use this function, we need to compute

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,100
the net present value of project for any given discount rate.

63
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,010
This initial discount rate is often referred to

64
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,269
as an initial guess.

65
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,329
So I will set it 0.25%.

66
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,090
And let's compute the net present value

67
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,400
for this initial guess.

68
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,150
Net present value equals to the initial investment amount

69
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,850
plus the annual cash flow divided

70
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,220
by the initial guess multiplied by 1 minus 1 divided by 1

71
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,630
plus the discount rate raised to the power 10.

72
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,910
So if the discount rate is 0.25%,

73
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:53,000
the NPV is $15,374, same as we had before.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,250
Now, let's use Goal Seek function.

75
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:02,340
We're going to Data tab, What-If Analysis, Goal Seek.

76
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,990
Goal Seek allows us to vary or to find the discount rate that

77
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,530
would set the net present value to any value that we want.

78
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,280
Now, since we are trying to find internal rate of return,

79
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,290
we want to set this cell, D9, where the NPV is

80
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:26,380
to 0 by changing this cell.

81
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,010
So we want to find the net present value that

82
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,180
would equal to 0 by changing the initial guess that we

83
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,520
set for a discount rate.

84
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,420
When we press OK button, Excel solves this equation

85
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,760
and finds the discount rate that sets the NPV of this project

86
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,410
to 0.

87
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,890
In this case, the discount rate that sets NPV to 0

88
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:59,893
is 8.64%, which, by definition, is the internal rate of return

89
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:00,560
of this project.

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,100


91
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,750
Goal Seek function is a useful tool that

92
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,610
allows you to solve any nonlinear equation in Excel.

93
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,560
The second method that we'll learn

94
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,050
how to find internal rate of return

95
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,610
just simply utilizes the IRR function in Excel.

96
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,050
Through this function, we need to enter all cash flows

97
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,480
that our project generates.

98
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,280
We'll start with the Year 0 where

99
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,490
we have the outflow of $30,000.

100
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,480
And then for the subsequent years, from Year 1

101
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:46,790
until Year 10, our project returns $4,600 every year.

102
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,240
Now, in this area, we have all of the cash flows

103
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,170
that this project generates.

104
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:58,410
To find its internal rate of return, we use IRR function.

105
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,370
So we type IRR.

106
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,540
And then we simply select the entire array in which

107
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,622
we have our cash flows.

108
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,080
There is a second parameter that is

109
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,760
required for the IRR function.

110
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,110
It's an optional parameter.

111
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,420
In some complicated cases, it does matter.

112
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,920
In our case, it does not.

113
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,720
We can put 0 here and hit Enter.

114
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,690
This function tells us the internal rate

115
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,250
of return of this project is 8.64%,

116
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,760
the same IRR that we got from using Goal Seek function.

117
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,010


118
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,520
The second part of this question asks,

119
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,670
if the cost of capital for this project is 9%,

120
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,260
should you take it?

121
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,140
We have found that the internal rate of return of this project

122
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,220
is 8.64%.

123
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,660
Now, let's recall the IRR rule, which

124
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,400
states we should invest only if the internal rate of return

125
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,630
of a project is higher than its cost of capital.

126
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,700
In our case, the internal rate of return of 8.64%

127
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,760
is less than 9%, which is the cost of capital

128
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,120
for this project.

129
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,090
Therefore, we should not take it.

130
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,290
To confirm, let us also compute the net present value

131
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,410
of this project given its cost of capital.

132
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,030
If the cost of capital is 9%, the NPV of this project

133
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,960
is negative $479.

134
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,650
NPV of this project is negative.

135
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,809
Therefore, we should not take it.

136
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:41,120
Both IRR and NPV investment decision rules in this case

137
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,670
agree.

138
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,000
