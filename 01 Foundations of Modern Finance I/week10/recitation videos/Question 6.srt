1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,750
PROFESSOR: Rio Tinto is considering the development

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,610
of a bauxite mine.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,430
Development costs are estimated to be $24 million in year zero.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,390
The mine will generate 4 million in cash flows

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,840
over the next 10 years, starting in year 1

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,000
and ending in year 10.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,570
After that, Rio Tinto is planning to close the mine

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,370
and to bring the site in compliance

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,310
with environmental laws.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,890
The estimated costs of closing and compliance

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,770
are expected to be $350,000 per year starting in year 11

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,720
and continuing in perpetuity.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,940
Assume that the cost of capital is 8%.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,410
The first question asks find the internal rate

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,870
of return of this project.

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,560
Should you invest in this project based on the IRR rule?

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,840
Let's start by entering given information

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,030
into the spreadsheet.

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:08,280
In year 0 we have to spend $24 million to develop the mine.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,810
In years 1 through 10, the mine will generate $4 million

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,570
per year.

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:23,010
Starting in year 11 we have to spend $350,000 or 0.35 million

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,100
per year in compliance costs.

24
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:34,050
First, let's write down the NPV of this project as a function

25
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,510
of discount rate r.

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,340
It equals to negative 24 million,

27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,180
which is the initial investment, plus the second term, which

28
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,750
captures present value of positive cash flows

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,220
that the project generates in years 1 through 10.

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,920
This is a simple annuity that pays 4 million

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,820
each year for 10 years.

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,860
The last term captures compliance costs,

33
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,550
it is a perpetuity that starts in year 11.

34
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,919
We can use the perpetuity formula

35
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,370
to find its value in year 10, which is 0.35 divided by r

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,415
and then we discount this value to present.

37
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,920


38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,430
Now to find the internal rate of return

39
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,600
we need to set this NPV to 0 and solve this equation for r.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,510
Now obviously we cannot do this by hand because this is

41
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,540
a linear equation of high dimension.

42
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,670
We also cannot use IRR formula that we used in previous

43
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,810
question because we're dealing with perpetuity and therefore

44
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,550
cannot enter the entire stream of cash flows into an array.

45
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,870
In other words, we just cannot enter an infinite array here

46
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,670
in Excel.

47
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,890
Therefore we need to utilize Goal Seek tool.

48
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,950
Let's start with initial guess for IRR, say 1%.

49
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,210
Given this 1% I will compute the net present value

50
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,710
of this project.

51
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,630
I will break down this calculation

52
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,160
into three parts, the initial investment, the annuity part

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,430
and the perpetuity part.

54
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:31,280
The initial investment simply equals to negative 24 million.

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,180
The annuity part equals to 4, divided

56
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:47,930
by r, multiplied by 1 minus 1, divided by 1 plus r,

57
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,120
raised to the power 10.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,020


59
00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:04,700
And the perpetuity part equals to 0.35, divided by r,

60
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,010
and this entire expression is divided or discounted

61
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,390
to present at discount rate r.

62
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,339


63
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:24,220
Now the NPV of the project is the sum

64
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,390
of these three components.

65
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:32,510


66
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,410
Now to find the internal rate of return,

67
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:43,270
I go to Data, What If Analysis, Goal Seek, so I

68
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,480
set the cell or the NPV to 0, remember

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,785
that internal rate of return is the discount rate

70
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:54,790
r that sets this NPV to 0, by changing

71
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,560
the cell of our initial guess.

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,760


73
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,160
So Excel solves this for us and gives us

74
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,820
the solution that the internal rate of return for this project

75
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,850
equals to 2.48%.

76
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:17,460
Now given that the cost of capital is 8%

77
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,020
and the internal rate of return is

78
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,310
less than the cost of capital, the conventional internal rate

79
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,190
of return rule would imply that we should not

80
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,860
take this project.

81
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,440
The second part of this question asks

82
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,350
us to find the net present value and asks

83
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,690
whether we should invest in this project based on the NPV rule.

84
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,810
Well the NPV of this project is simply this expression,

85
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,930
it is the same expression that we just

86
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,720
used to find internal rate of return

87
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,580
but here we're just using the cost of capital of 8%.

88
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,480
Turns out that the net present value of this project

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,270
is $814,000, therefore Rio Tinto should go ahead

90
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,850
with this project.

91
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,920
This contradicts the answer that we

92
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,080
received based on the internal rate of return rule.

93
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,170
So what gives?

94
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,910
To understand what's going on let's

95
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,030
build an NPV profile of this project.

96
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:25,720
I have created an array of discount rates from 2% to 15%

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,470
in quarter of a percent increments.

98
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,510
For each of these discount rates let's

99
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,780
compute the net present value.

100
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:40,150
I'm using here the same formula as the one we just used.

101
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,800
I will extend this array which will automatically

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,940
compute the net present value for all discount rates

103
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,550
that we have here.

104
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,500
Now what we see on the graph is the NPV profile

105
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,810
of this project.

106
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,190
Recall that in question 5 NPV profile was a decreasing

107
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,890
function of discount rates.

108
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,520
What we see here is a very different picture,

109
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,940
NPV profile is first increasing and then decreasing

110
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,730
in discount rates.

111
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,700
We visually see that when discount rate is

112
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,060
8%, which is our cost of capital,

113
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,380
the net present value of this project is positive

114
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,990
and therefore we should take this project.

115
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,820


116
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,660
To understand why IRR rule gave us the wrong investment advice

117
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,980
recall the following, IRR rule can be used only

118
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,440
when cash outflow occurs only in time 0,

119
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,440
only one project is under consideration,

120
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,520
opportunity cost of capital is the same for all periods

121
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,900
and the threshold rate is set to the cost of capital.

122
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,940
In our case, cash outflow occurs in year 0

123
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,390
as well as from year 11 onwards.

124
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,830
Therefore, we cannot use the internal rate of return rule

125
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,130
to make an investment decision in this case.

126
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,670
Let me make another remark, the NPV profile

127
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:28,700
here shows that this project has two internal rates of return.

128
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,950
The first one is somewhere between 2% and 3%

129
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,640
and the second one is somewhere around 9%

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,789
but when we used Goal Seek tool it gave us only one solution.

131
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,350
The reason for this is the initial guess or the starting

132
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,120
point.

133
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,370
Our first initial starting point was

134
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,780
1% and the numerical algorithm that

135
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,080
solved this equation converged to the first solution here,

136
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,250
which was 2.48%.

137
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,050
But if we started from a different initial guess

138
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,410
or initial starting point anywhere to the right

139
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,670
from this hump, say at 6%, we would have

140
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,750
converged to the second IRR.

141
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,010
To confirm this, let's go back to the other spreadsheet

142
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,940
and use Goal Seek tool with the starting point of 6%.

143
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:36,040
So in this initial guess cell I will put 6%

144
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,590
and I will go back to Goal Seek tool

145
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,520
and I will ask it to set the net present value of this project

146
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,390
to 0 by changing the discount rate cell.

147
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,940
And if we solve this equation from a different starting

148
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,210
point, we see that the algorithm here

149
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,360
converged to this second internal rate of return,

150
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,270
which is 9.04% in this case.

151
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,610
The conclusion is that this project has two IRRs

152
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,620
and we can find both of them using numerical tools in Excel.

153
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,760
But what's more important is that we cannot use the internal

154
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,430
rate of return rule to make the investment decision in this

155
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:32,040
case because the conditions under which we can use the IRR

156
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,940
rule are not satisfied, namely in this case,

157
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,000
we have cash outflows that occur after year zero.

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,470
In particular, the compliance costs that start in year 11

159
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,250
and continue onwards.

160
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,000
