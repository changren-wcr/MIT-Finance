1
00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:02,140
PROFESSOR: You're considering a project

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,910
that requires immediate investment

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,240
in year zero of $37,000.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,638
You expect that it will generate $20,000 in year one,

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,030
$15,000 in year two, $10,000 in year three,

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,340
and $2,500 in year four.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,460
The first question asks, what is the payback period

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,990
of this project?

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,940
Well, let's solve this question.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,000
By definition, the payback period

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,340
is the amount of time it takes to pay back

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,350
the initial investment.

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,410
In our case, the initial investment is $37,000.

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,500
In the first year, the project returns

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,270
$20,000, which is less than the initial investment.

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,710
Therefore, this project does not pay back our initial investment

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,810
within one year.

18
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,760
In the second year, the project returns $15,000.

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,500
Therefore, during the first two years,

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,630
the project returns 20,000 plus 15,000,

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,050
which equals to $35,000.

22
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,460
This is still less than $37,000, which

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,150
means that the project does not pay back the initial investment

24
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,420
within the first two years.

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,040
In the third year, the project pays off $10,000.

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,260
Therefore, during the first three years

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,960
of life of this project, it returns 20,000 plus 15,000

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,970
plus $10,000.

29
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,930
Altogether, this equals $45,000.

30
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,850
Now, this is more than the initial investment of $37,000.

31
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,230
Therefore, the payback period of this project

32
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,350
is three years because it pays back our initial investment

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,530
within the first three years.

34
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,870
The second question asks if you require

35
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,500
a payback period of two years, will you take this project?

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,600
Let's solve this question.

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,640
If you follow a payback period rule,

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,610
then you only take projects that pay back

39
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,880
within two years of initial investment.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,620
In part a, we computed the payback period of the project

41
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,550
under consideration.

42
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,600
This payback period was three years.

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,160
Since this project pays back within three years,

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,250
and you only take projects that pay back within two years,

45
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,390
you will not take this project.

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,510
Third question-- what is the net present value of this project

47
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,550
if the cost of capital is 12%?

48
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,400
According to the net present value rule,

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,950
should you take this project?

50
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,280
If the cost of capital is 12%, the NPV of this project

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,930
is as follows.

52
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,520
Negative $37,000, which is the initial investment,

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,440
plus $20,000 that we receive in year one discounted to present.

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,470
Plus $15,000 that we receive in the year two

55
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,060
discounted to present.

56
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,540
Plus $10,000 we receive in year three discounted to present.

57
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,890
And finally, $2,500 received in year four

58
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,010
discounted to present.

59
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:21,950
Altogether, this equals to $1,521.65.

60
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,580
Since the net present value of this project is positive,

61
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,890
we should take this project.

62
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,500
Now, let us pause and think.

63
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,910
Payback period rule tells us not to take this project,

64
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,980
while the net present value rule says that we

65
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,050
should take this project.

66
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,010
Recall that following the net present value rule

67
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,860
is always optimal because it increases

68
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,210
the value of the firm.

69
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,610
Therefore, by following the payback period rule

70
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,230
in this case, we would have made the wrong decision

71
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,260
and would not have increased firm value.

72
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,220


73
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,620
Let us summarize this lesson.

74
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,580
Payback period rule can lead to wrong investment decisions.

75
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,530
This happens because, one, payback period rule relies

76
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,140
on ad hoc decision criterion.

77
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,340
Why we decided to take projects with payback period of two

78
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,890
years or less and not three years or four years?

79
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,830
Who have made this decision?

80
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,690
There are clearly no good a priori

81
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,520
reasons for this decision.

82
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,080
Two, payback period rule ignores cash flows that

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,350
occur after the payback period.

84
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,590
In our case, this project returns $10,000 in year three

85
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,630
and $2,500 in year four.

86
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,820
By following the payback period rule

87
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,350
we carve off two years while ignoring these cash flows.

88
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,380
As shown by NPV calculation, these cash

89
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,350
flows clearly make a difference in this case

90
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,050
because the net present value of this project is positive.

91
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,830
And three, payback period rule ignores project's cost

92
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,630
of capital and time value of money.

93
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,000
