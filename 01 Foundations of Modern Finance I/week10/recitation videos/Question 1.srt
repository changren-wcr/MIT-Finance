00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,110


1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,000
PROFESSOR: Now is year zero.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,540
You're considering opening a new concept restaurant.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,330
Last year, you have hired a consulting company

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,390
to help you evaluate your business idea.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,860
The consulting company charged you $125,000,

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,980
and turned in the following operating projections

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,710
for the next 10 years.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,880
Annual revenue is expected to be $270,000,

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,550
and will start in year one.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,640
Annual expenses will also start in year one,

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,390
and are expected to be $130,000.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,460
In year zero, you will make capital investments,

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,630
which primarily include restaurant equipment,

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,360
totaling $650,000.

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,190
This equipment will be depreciated

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,340
using straight line depreciation method over the next 10 years.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,810
The appropriate cost of capital is 10%.

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,560
And the current tax rate is 21%.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,630
Your goal is to determine whether you should

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,200
open this restaurant or not.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,290
Let's solve this question.

22
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,090
We are asked to evaluate whether we

23
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,090
should open the new restaurant.

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,120
To make this decision, we should use the net present value

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,730
rule, which states that we should

26
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,720
invest if the net present value is positive.

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,190
The net present value is defined as the sum of project's cash

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,940
flows discounted to present using appropriate discount

29
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,320
rates.

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,260
Therefore, to compute the net present value,

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,450
we first should compute project's cash flows.

32
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,920
Cash flows are defined as 1 minus tax rate times operating

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,600
profit minus capital expenditures plus tax rate

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,320
times depreciation minus change in working capital.

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,010
Tax rate times depreciation is known as the depreciation tax

36
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,830
shield, which arises due to the fact

37
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,800
that depreciation is a tax deductible expense.

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,060
Notice that in this question we are not

39
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,910
given any information regarding working capital requirements

40
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,040
of running the restaurant.

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,110
Therefore, we will assume that changes in the working capital

42
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,990
are zero.

43
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,450
In this case, cash flows can be computed

44
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,520
as 1 minus tax rate times operating profit minus capital

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,420
expenditures plus depreciation tax shield.

46
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,790
Let's record all of the given information

47
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,400
into the spreadsheet and use it to compute

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,340
the net present value of this project.

49
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,940
Consulting fees of $125,000.

50
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,670
Annual revenue is $270,000.

51
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,330
Expenses are $130,000.

52
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,560
And capital expenditures, which I abbreviate here as CapEx,

53
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,880
are $650,000.

54
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,870
Tax rate is 21%.

55
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,560
Cost of capital is 10%.

56
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,110
The question tells us that the restaurant will start

57
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,280
generating revenue in year one.

58
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,950
And this revenue will continue every year from year one

59
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,390
until year 10.

60
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,600


61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,770
Expenses also start in year one.

62
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,900
And similar to revenue, they continue all the way

63
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,600
through year 10.

64
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,560
Now, knowing revenue and expenses,

65
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,520
we can compute operating profit, which

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,220
equals to the difference between revenue and expenses.

67
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,420
So therefore, every year from year one

68
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:55,020
through year 10 operating profit equals to $140,000.

69
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,490
Now, next, we need to compute annual depreciation expense.

70
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,620
The question tells us that capital assets

71
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,050
will be depreciated using straight line depreciation

72
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,880
method over the next 10 years.

73
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,220
So therefore, to compute the annual depreciation expense,

74
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,959
we're taking capital expenditure,

75
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,000
and we're dividing it by 10.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,070
So therefore, every year, depreciation expense

77
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,370
would equal to $65,000.

78
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,600
Capital expenditures occur only in year zero.

79
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,170
That's when we buy restaurant equipment.

80
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,900
Now, knowing operating profit, depreciation capital

81
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,630
expenditure, we can compute after tax cash flow.

82
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,220
Recall that by definition of the tax cash flow equal to 1

83
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,380
minus tax rate, which is 21% in this case, multiplied

84
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,410
by operating profits minus capital

85
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,860
expenditure plus depreciation tax shield,

86
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,765
which equals to the tax rate multiplied by depreciation

87
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:10,265
expense.

88
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:15,810


89
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,620
And so in year zero, after tax cash flow

90
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,130
equals to negative $650,000.

91
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,390
In all the subsequent years, in year one through year 10,

92
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:33,530
after tax cash flow equals to $124,250.

93
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,610
Now, the final step to compute the net present value,

94
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,255
we need to discount all of these cash flows to present.

95
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:42,140
To discount these cash flows to present,

96
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,182
we're taking the cash flow, and we're dividing it

97
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:51,800
by 1 plus cost of capital raised to the power which

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,275
equals to the year when this cash flow occurs.

99
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:58,550


100
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,000
So these are the discounted cash flows.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,150
And the net present value simply equals to the sum

102
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,500
of the discounted cash flows.

103
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,930


104
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:18,040
So the net present value here equals to $113,462.

105
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,190
Now, what about consulting fees?

106
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,790
Since we paid these fees last year, they are sunk.

107
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,130
And we should not take them into account

108
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,270
when making our decision whether to open the restaurant or not.

109
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:37,480
Since the net present value is positive $113,462,

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,200
we should go ahead and open the restaurant.

111
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,060
Now, let me also teach you how to use

112
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,200
the NPV function in Excel to directly compute

113
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,490
the net present value.

114
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,950
The function NPV takes the first argument

115
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,710
as the discount rate, which in our case

116
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,790
is the cost of capital.

117
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,210
And the values are all of the cash flows

118
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,610
that start from year one onwards.

119
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,700
So remember, because we're using NPV function,

120
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,340
we're just taking the cash flows that are not discounted.

121
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,520
So the function will discount these cash flows for us.

122
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,440
If we also subtract the initial investment of $650,000,

123
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,150
this calculation should equal to the net present value, which

124
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,300
we computed by just summing up the cash flows

125
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,310
that we discounted ourselves.

126
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,890
So the two results are identical.

127
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,810
You might have thought of a more compact way

128
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,000
of solving this problem.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,220
Since every year, starting in year one

130
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,120
and ending in year 10, revenue, expenses, and depreciation

131
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,780
expense are constant, after-tax cash flows

132
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,300
have to be constant as well.

133
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,850
They equal to 1 minus tax rate, which

134
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,000
is 21%, times operating profit, which

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,520
is $140,000, plus depreciation tax shield, which altogether

136
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,130
equals to $124,250.

137
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,100
We can compute the present value of these cash flows

138
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,360
from year one through year 10 using the annuity formula

139
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,250
as follows.

140
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:26,640
$124,250 divided by 10%, which is our cost of capital,

141
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,930
multiplied by 1 minus 1 divided by 1 plus 10%,

142
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,179
again, our cost of capital, raised to the power of 10,

143
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,570
which equals the number of periods.

144
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:44,210
This equals to $763,462.

145
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,690
Given the initial investment of $650,000,

146
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:56,630
the net present value equals to $113,462, exactly the number

147
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,270
that we obtained before.

148
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,910
Notice how much faster we were able to solve this

149
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,130
question by utilizing the annuity formula.

150
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,620
Keep this in mind and use this approach whenever possible,

151
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,630
especially on the exam.

152
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,000
