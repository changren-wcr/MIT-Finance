PROFESSOR: Cyber Vision, a computer vision startup

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,120
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, considers

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,730
opening a new division to explore the viability

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,620
of a new technology.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,320
To evaluate its decision, Cyber Vision

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,020
first needs to forecast working capital

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,690
needs for the new division.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,880
Its Chief Financial Officer developed

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,110
the following projections in thousands of dollars.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:31,090
Accounts receivable are expected to be $0, $50,000, $60,000,

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:36,480
and $75,000 in years zero, one, two, and three respectively.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,090
Inventory is expected to be at $120,000, $150,000, $200,000,

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,120
and another $200,000 in years zero, one, two,

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,700
and three respectively.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,210
Accounts payable are expected to be $40,000, $40,000, $80,000,

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,460
$100,000 in years zero, one, two, and three respectively.

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,920
Calculate the cash flows associated

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,400
with changes in working capital for the first three years

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,870
of this investment.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,730
This question is designed to help

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,160
us understand the impact of working capital

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,930
requirements on cash flow.

23
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,900
First, let's use forecasts of accounts receivable, inventory,

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,650
and accounts payable to compute net working

25
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,500
capital in each year.

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,040
By definition, net working capital

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,750
equals to accounts receivable plus inventory minus accounts

28
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,970
payable, therefore in year zero, net working capital

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:49,510
will equal to $0 plus $120,000 minus $40,000 or $80,000.

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,590
In subsequent years, in years one, two, and three,

31
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:01,180
net working capital will equal $160,000, $180,000 and $175,000

32
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,180
respectively.

33
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,280
Now, recall that it's not the net working capital itself,

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,630
but rather changes in net working capital

35
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,860
is what affects the cash flow, so let's compute

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,890
increases in net working capital each year.

37
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,440
In year zero, this increase is just

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,750
$80 because we go from up $0 up to $80,000.

39
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,880
In the year one, this increase will

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,290
equal to $160,000, which is the level of net working

41
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,310
capital in year one minus $80, which

42
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,820
was the level of net working capital in the year zero,

43
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,370
so this is the increase of another $80,000.

44
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,160
In year two, net working capital increases by $20,000,

45
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,830
from $160,000 to $180,000 and in year three decreases by $5,000,

46
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,830
from $180,000 down to $175,000.

47
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,270
Now, the final step is to compute

48
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,460
the associated impact of increases

49
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,700
in net working capital on cash flow.

50
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,560
Recall that, by definition, cash flow equals to 1 minus tax rate

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,070
times operating profit minus capital

52
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,530
expenditures plus depreciation tax shield minus change

53
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,600
in net working capital, therefore the cash flow

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,280
will be of the opposite sign from increases

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,970
in net working capital.

56
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,780
So in year zero, cash flow is going to be equal

57
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,730
to negative $80,000.

58
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,740
In year one, it will also equal to negative $80,000.

59
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,960
In year two, it will equal to negative $20,000,

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,310
and in year three, it is going to equal to positive $5,000.

61
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,580
Now let's try to understand the intuition here.

62
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:11,250
Why in year one we have a cash outflow of $80,000?

63
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,650
Well, let's look at the components

64
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,140
of net working capital.

65
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,250
Accounts payable don't change.

66
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,570
They remain at $40,000.

67
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,030
But accounts receivable go up from $0 to $50,000,

68
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,310
and inventory goes up from $120,000 to $150,000,

69
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,960
therefore it's this build-up in the receivables

70
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:46,800
and the inventory that causes an outflow of $80,000 in year one.

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
