00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,880
PROFESSOR: In this video, we'll talk about returns.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,870
I will define what is a gross return

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,270
and what is a net return.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,300
Gross return, by definition, is the future value

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,990
of an asset divided by its current value.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,030
And net return is the future value

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,290
of an asset divided by its current value minus 1.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:29,366
In other words, net return will be just gross return minus 1.

9
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:32,340
And now let's consider a simple example.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,750
So suppose that you bought an apartment with a current value

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,890
of $200,000.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,970
And the future value of this apartment,

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:52,950
let's say in one year, is $300,000.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,170
What is your gross and net return

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,290
on the purchase of this apartment?

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,450
By definition, gross return, in this case,

17
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:12,000
would be $300,000 divided by $200,000.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,520
And if we expressed that ratio in percentages,

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,280
this would be 150%.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,970
So when we talk about returns, we express them in percentages.

21
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,420
So the gross return on the purchase of this apartment

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,600
is 150%.

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,970
Now, the net return would be just gross return,

24
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:43,595
which is 150%, minus 1, or 100%, which would give us 50%.

25
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:45,720
So the net return on the purchase of this apartment

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,590
is 50%.

27
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,110


28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,940
When we talk about returns, most frequently

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,840
we mean just net returns.

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
For example, if you hear someone is

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,290
saying that a stock had a 10% return, that 10%

32
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,400
is net return number.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,560
For example, if the stock price was $100 and it had 10% return,

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,260
it means that its current value is $110.

35
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,228
Now, both gross and net return are random variables.

36
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:18,770
And the reason for that is because we

37
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,850
don't know what the future value of any of the asset is.

38
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,060
So in this particular example, if the current value

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,530
of the apartment is $200,000, its future value of $300,000

40
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,390
is just a guess.

41
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,810
And therefore, since this future value isn't known,

42
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,060
both gross and net return are random variables.
