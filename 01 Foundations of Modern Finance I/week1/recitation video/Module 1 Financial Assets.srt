1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,020
PROFESSOR: Financial assets include bank deposits,

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,630
certificate of deposits, commercial paper,

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,950
treasury securities, corporate bonds, stocks,

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,160
and derivative securities.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,280
In the segment, we will discuss in detail

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,410
each of these financial assets.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,360
Bank deposits are money placed into banks for safekeeping.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,330
They include money deposited in the checking accounts

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,780
and savings accounts.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,910
In the United States, these accounts

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,510
are partially insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,440
Corporation, or FDIC.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,160
The standard deposit insurance coverage limit is $250,000.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,020
They account holder has the right

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,730
to withdraw deposited funds as set forth

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,880
in the terms and conditions governing the account

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,960
agreement.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,240
Typically, there are no restrictions

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,585
on withdrawals from checking and savings accounts.

20
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:08,400


21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,440
Certificate of deposit, or a CD, is a financial product

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,920
offered by banks that allows a customer to deposit money

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,170
for a specific time period.

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,280
So these differ from regular savings accounts

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,640
in that the CD has a specific fixed term, often one, three,

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,530
or six months, or one to five years,

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,090
and usually a fixed interest rate.

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,520
The bank expects a CD to be held until maturity, at which time

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,000
they can be withdrawn and interest is paid.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,810
Because money deposited into CDs are illiquid,

31
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,280
interest rates on CDs are typically significantly higher

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,260
than interest rates on liquid accounts,

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,500
such as regular savings accounts.

34
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,030


35
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,340
Commercial paper is an unsecured, short-term debt

36
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,700
instrument issued by corporations, typically used

37
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,670
for the financing of payroll, accounts

38
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,130
payable and inventories, and meeting

39
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,740
other short-term liabilities.

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,000
Maturities on commercial paper typically last several days

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
and rarely range longer than 270 days.

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,970
The average maturity of commercial paper is 30 days.

43
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,670
Commercial paper is usually a cheaper source

44
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,000
of funds than a short-term bank loan.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,760
The minimum face value is $25,000.

46
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,640
And most commercial paper has a face value

47
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,705
of at least $100,000.

48
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:02,580
The interest on commercial paper is typically

49
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,480
paid by selling it at initial discount.

50
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,990
Commercial paper is rated by credit agencies,

51
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,645
similar to other types of corporate debt.

52
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:16,180
In the United States, treasury securities

53
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,060
are government debt instruments issued by the United States

54
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,110
Department of the Treasury to finance government spending.

55
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,730
Treasury securities are often referred

56
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,910
to simply as treasuries.

57
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,600
Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,830
of the United States, meaning that the government promises

59
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:45,340
to raise money by any legally available means to repay them.

60
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,250
Although the United States is a sovereign power

61
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,520
and may default without recourse,

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,520
its strong record of repayment has given treasury securities

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,710
a reputation as one of the world's

64
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,860
lowest-risk investments.

65
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,530
There are four types of marketable treasury

66
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,570
securities--

67
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:15,910
treasury bills, treasury notes, treasury bonds, and treasury

68
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,070
inflation-protected securities, or TIPS.

69
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,810
The government sells the securities

70
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,030
in auctions conducted by the Federal Reserve

71
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,910
Bank of New York, after which they can

72
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,320
be traded in secondary markets.

73
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,320


74
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,810
Treasury bills are treasuries with maturities

75
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,870
equal or less than 1 year.

76
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,510
Treasury notes are treasuries with maturities

77
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,090
between 2 and 10 years.

78
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,810
Treasury bonds are long-term bonds with maturities

79
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,530
longer than 10 years.

80
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,910
The current longest maturity is 30 years.

81
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,370
Interestingly, in 2019, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin

82
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,390
announced an intent to issue a 50-year maturity,

83
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,330
ultra-long bond.

84
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,970
But as of 2020, these plans were canceled.

85
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,560
A corporate bond is a type of debt security

86
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,420
that is issued by a firm and sold to investors.

87
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,060
The company gets the capital it needs.

88
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,590
And in return, the investor is paid a pre-established number

89
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,190
of interest payments at either a fixed or variable interest

90
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,360
rate.

91
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,710
When the bond expires or reaches maturity,

92
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,470
the payments seize and the original investment

93
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,360
is returned.

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,030
A stock, also known as equity, is a security

95
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,610
that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation.

96
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,330
This entitles the owner of the stock

97
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,330
to a proportion of the corporation's assets

98
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,740
and profits equal to how much stock they own.

99
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,140
Units of stock are called shares.

100
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,950
For example, as of April 23, 2020,

101
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:21,040
Tesla Motors had 185,371,105 shares outstanding.

102
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,570
Owning one share of Tesla would give you an ownership of 1

103
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:41,220
divided by 185,371,105 shares, or 0.00000054% of the firm.

104
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,900
Stocks are bought and sold predominantly

105
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,250
on stock exchanges, though they can be private sales as well.

106
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,720
These transactions have to conform

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,420
to government regulations, which are meant to protect investors

108
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,370
from fraudulent practices.

109
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,620
Corporate stocks form one of the major asset classes.

110
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,520
Today, many people own stocks either directly as part

111
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,760
of their investment portfolios or indirectly

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,932
through managed retirement plans.

113
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,310
A financial derivative is a security

114
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,790
whose value is derived from an underlying asset

115
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,360
or group of assets.

116
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,380
The derivative itself is a contract

117
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,590
between two or more parties.

118
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,050
A well-known example of a derivative

119
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,660
is a financial option.

120
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,050
An option gives you a right to buy or sell

121
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,550
an underlying asset--

122
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,440
for example, a stock--

123
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,470
according to agreed-upon terms.

124
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,400
These terms include the time when the transaction happens

125
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,830
as well as the price at which the assets can

126
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,904
be bought or sold.

127
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,600
The price of a derivative security

128
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,370
depends on fluctuations in the value of the underlying assets.

129
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,480
Common derivative securities include forwards, futures,

130
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,760
and interest rate swaps.

131
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,910
Derivatives are commonly used to manage risks and hedge

132
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,750
against events that can adversely affect values

133
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,350
of owned assets as well as to speculate and make

134
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,920
bets on certain outcomes in the financial and other markets.
