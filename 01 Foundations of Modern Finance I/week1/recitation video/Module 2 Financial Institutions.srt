1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:01,620
PROFESSOR: In this segment, we will

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,190
talk about major types of financial institutions.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,060
The list includes commercial banks, savings and loans

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,630
associations, investment banks, insurance companies,

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,300
and investment funds.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,610
A commercial bank provides services,

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,300
such as accepting deposits, making personal and business

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,440
loans, including credit cards and offering basic investment

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,070
products, such as savings accounts and certificates

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,940
of deposit.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,650
Examples include well-known names,

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,700
such as Bank of America in the United States,

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,780
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, or ICBC,

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,210
and CrÃ©dit Agricole in France.

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,900
A savings and loan association, or S&L,

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,080
is a financial institution that specializes

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,020
in accepting savings deposits and making

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,810
mortgage and other loans.

19
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,260
The key difference between S&L and commercial bank

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,810
is that S&L traditionally placed a stronger emphasis

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,030
on the residential mortgage loans,

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,850
while many large commercial banks concentrate

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,080
on working with large businesses by providing loans.

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,870
In addition to providing residential mortgages,

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,310
commercial banks also engage in mortgage loans targeting

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,750
the construction and expansion needs of regional, national,

27
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,880
and international businesses.

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,840
S&L's used to play a very important role

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,080
in the residential mortgage market in the United States.

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,970
In the mid 1970s, their share of mortgages in single family

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,370
houses was over 50%.

32
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,030
During 1980s, the number of S&L's in the United States

33
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,910
decreased more than twice.

34
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,060
One of the reasons was an increase in interest rates

35
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,340
together with the fact that portfolios

36
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,750
of deposits and loans had different properties making

37
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,580
S&L's particularly vulnerable to increases in the interest

38
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,419
rates.

39
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,020
This situation is called duration mismatch,

40
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,550
which we'll describe in the second half of this course.

41
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,040
An investment bank is a financial services company

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,790
that helps corporations and governments to raise capital

43
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,020
by underwriting or acting as the clients agent

44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,990
in the issuance of securities.

45
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,570
An investment bank also helps firms involved

46
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,100
in mergers and acquisitions, or M&A's, by advising them

47
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,440
and providing capital needed to facilitate these transactions.

48
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,740
Investment banks also have brokerage and asset management

49
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,230
departments.

50
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,460
Unlike commercial banks, investment banks

51
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,480
do not take deposits.

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,190
From the passage of Glass-Steagall Act in 1933

53
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,210
until its repeal in 1999, the United States

54
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,900
maintains a separation between investment banking

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,400
and commercial banks.

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,460
Other countries have historically not maintained

57
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,200
such a separation.

58
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,250
As part of the Dodd-Frank act of 2010,

59
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,880
the Volcker Rule asserts some separation

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,470
of investment banking services from commercial banking.

61
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,830
Today, most large banks have both commercial and investment

62
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,510
banking divisions.

63
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,620
For example, JPMorgan Chase was formed

64
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,330
by a merger of investment bank JP

65
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,120
Morgan with a commercial bank Chase Manhattan.

66
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,730
An insurance company is a financial services company

67
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,310
that sells insurance products, such as life

68
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,770
insurance and property and casualty insurance.

69
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,190
Insurance companies collect insurance premiums

70
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,980
from customers, which include both individuals

71
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,620
and corporations, and pay out claims

72
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,510
following insured events.

73
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,990
An insurance company typically invests its capital that

74
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,280
comes from insurance premiums.

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,010
For example, insurance firms are some

76
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,160
of the largest buyers of corporate bonds in the United

77
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,540
States.

78
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,650
Management of assets and liabilities

79
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,820
is at the core of the business model of insurance firms.

80
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,640
Finally, investment funds are investment vehicles

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,900
that allow investing alongside other investors

82
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,260
in order to benefit from the advantages of working

83
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,240
and investing as part of a group.

84
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,060
Types of investment funds include mutual funds,

85
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,220
exchange trade funds, hedge funds,

86
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,060
and private equity funds.

87
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,470
Mutual funds and exchange trade funds, or ETFs,

88
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,340
are currently one of the main vehicles for retail investors

89
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,690
to access diversified investment products.

90
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,170
We'll talk more about them later in the class.

91
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,540
A hedge fund is an investment fund

92
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,850
that trades in relatively liquid assets

93
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,900
and is able to make extensive use of more complex trading,

94
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,420
portfolio construction, and risk management

95
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,730
techniques to improve performance,

96
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,060
while limiting risk exposure.

97
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,080
An example of a well-known and very successful hedge fund

98
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,000
is the Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,570
founded by James Simons.

100
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,380
Finally, private equity funds is an investment fund

101
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,810
that directly invests in private companies,

102
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,990
or they're engaged in buyouts of public companies,

103
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,280
resulting in the listing of public equity.

104
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,950
Over the last 10 years, private equity investing

105
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,220
has been one of the fastest growing industries in finance.
