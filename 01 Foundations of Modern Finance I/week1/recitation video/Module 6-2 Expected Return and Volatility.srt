00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:05,910
PROFESSOR: In this video, we will define what is variance

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,440
and standard deviation of the returned distribution.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,190
We will continue working with our example of Nikola stock.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,240
Let's first define, what is variance?

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,920
Variance of return R is the expected squared deviation

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:33,870
from the mean, meaning that it is expected squared deviation,

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,080
which is this from the mean.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,710
And we know that this ER is the mean or the expected return.

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,930


10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,370
So you could see that, if the return never

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,560
deviates from its mean, the variance will be zero.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,460
Otherwise, the variance will be increasing with the magnitude

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,400
of the deviation from the mean.

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,650
Therefore, the variance is a measure

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,970
of how spread out the distribution of return is,

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:16,080
so let us compute this variance right now for Nikola stock.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,110
But first, let's write down this expression that

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,860
is written in expected value terms

19
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,050
as applied to our case of this Greek distribution.

20
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:32,240
So it's going to be sum of probabilities, PIs, multiplied

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:40,270
by return RI that we'd get in a given state minus the expected

22
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,910
return, and this will be squared.

23
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,100
So this is for all I's from one to N,

24
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,100
however many states we have.

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,530
Now, let's continue writing down this expression

26
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,670
and just applying it to our case.

27
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:59,670
It's going to be P1 multiplied by R1 minus expected

28
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:07,500
return plus P2 times R2 minus the expected return

29
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,620
plus B3 times R3 minus the expected return,

30
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,470
and we have to square all of these differences.

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,500
So that we get the correct expression,

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,660
and this is because we have only three states in this example.

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,700
Now, recall that returns in individual states were this.

34
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,370
So in this upstate or in the very positive scenario,

35
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,440
the return was 368.75%.

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,780
In the second scenario, the return was negative 37.5%.

37
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:54,580
In the most adverse scenario, the return was negative 93.75%.

38
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,360
The expected return was negative 13.75%.

39
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,390
So now, we can plug-in all of these numbers

40
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,460
into the expression for the variance of the return.

41
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:12,400
So it's 10% multiplied by 368.75% minus,

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,150
and we're subtracting the negative number.

43
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:24,190
So minus negative 13.75% squared plus 60% multiplied

44
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,878
by negative 37.5% minus--

45
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:30,670
again, we're subtracting a negative number.

46
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,650
So we would effectively be adding them up,

47
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:43,950
so 23.75% squared as well plus 30% multiplied

48
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:56,330
by negative 93.75% minus negative 13.75%

49
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,360
squared as well.

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,440
The value of this expression equals to 1.69.

51
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,650
Now, finally, let me compute the standard deviation

52
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,570
of the return on the stock, which

53
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,700
by definition is the squared root of the variance.

54
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,950
And therefore, in our case, it is the squared root

55
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:26,170
of 1.69, which is 1.3.

56
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,130
Now, standard deviation of returns,

57
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,110
which is often referred to as volatility,

58
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,715
is often expressed in percentages.

59
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,340
So in this case, the standard deviation

60
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:43,170
of returns on this stock would be 130%.

61
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,630
Let me make one important remark.

62
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,480
Notice that I expressed standard deviation or the volatility

63
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,630
of returns in percentages.

64
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,680
So same units in which we measure

65
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,060
returns and expect that the returns as well.

66
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,630
But I haven't done that for the variance of returns,

67
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,270
and the reason for that is that variance returns is measured

68
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,620
in percentages squared.

69
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,180
And we could see it right here.

70
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,110
Because when we are taking the deviations from the mean,

71
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,400
we are raising them to power of two.

72
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,020
Therefore, when it comes to variance,

73
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,410
we typically just express it as a number and not

74
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,870
as a percentage.
