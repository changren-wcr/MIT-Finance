00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,670
PROFESSOR: In this segment, we'll talk about bonds.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,460
A bond is a promise to pay a fixed amount of money.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,700
Let's consider the following example.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,410
It's a bond issued by Ford, and it has a face value of $100.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,600
The current price of this bond is $97.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,940
The term is three years.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,970
And this bond will pay an interest,

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,370
which we call a coupon.

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,780
We'll assume that the interest is paid annually on this bond.

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,160
Now, let's look at the timeline of cash outflow and cash inflow

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,810
that we get from investing into this bond.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,930
In the year zero-- right now, when we purchase this bond--

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,640
we pay its price, $97.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,450
This price buys us the ability to get our money, or the face

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,170
value of this bond of $100, back at the end of year three

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,500
plus the coupons or the interest that this bond pays.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,590
In year one, we'll get the first coupon,

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,230
indicated as C1 on this chart.

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,080
The coupons are usually quoted as a percent

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,530
of the face value of the bond.

21
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,620
The face value of this bond is $100.

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,350
If the coupon is 1%, it would mean

23
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,880
that at the end of year one, we will

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,150
get 1% of $100, which is $1.

25
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,380
This will be our cash flow at the end of year one.

26
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,470
At the end of year two, we will get the same cash flow.

27
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,175
So it's the same coupon payment.

28
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:49,040
Well, we'll get 1% of $100, or $1.

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,500
That's our second cash inflow.

30
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,590
Finally, at the end of year three,

31
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,550
we will get our face value paid to us from the bond, which

32
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,340
is $100, plus the last coupon, which is another 1%

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,190
of $100, which is $1.

34
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,390
So the end of year three, we will get $101 paid to us.
