00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,760
PROFESSOR: In this video, I will introduce

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,180
a concept of expected return.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,760
Suppose that, currently, Nikola Corporation

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,260
is traded at $32 a share.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,720
We're given the probability distribution

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,530
of what will be a share price of Nikola next year.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,410
Suppose, though, with probability 10%,

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,200
the share price will increase all the way to $150.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,240
With 60% probability, the share price

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,689
is going to come down from $32 to $20.

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,540
And with the remaining 30% probability,

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,790
the share price will go all the way down to $2 a share.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,240
The question is, what is the expected return on this stock

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,220
over the next year?

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,240
And here, by return, I would mean net return.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,250
So first, let's compute what would

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,370
be the net return on Nikola stock price in each

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,370
of the corresponding cases, when the share price

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,050
goes up to $150, up to $20, or to $2.

20
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,290
So I will write down here net return, and I will compute it.

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,990
So in this first scenario, the net return on Nikola

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:23,490
is going to be $150 minus $32 divided by $32.

23
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:33,470
See, if you compute this, this gives us 368.75%.

24
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,320
So that is a very large return.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,260
Now, in the second scenario, the net return

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:48,678
will be $20 minus $32 divided by $32.

27
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:50,220
And you could see that, in this case,

28
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,410
the share price declines, so the return's going to be negative.

29
00:01:53,410 --> 00:02:00,070
So it's going to be negative 37.5%.

30
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,070
Now, in this last scenario, net return's

31
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:10,199
going to be $2 minus $32 divided by $32.

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,950
And that's going to be negative 93.75%.

33
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,670
So in this case, the share price goes almost to $0,

34
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,730
so we are losing most of our wealth.

35
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,310
Note that, by definition, net return can never

36
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,765
be less than negative 100%.

37
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:29,390
This would just mean that you're losing

38
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,890
all of your initial wealth that you invested into the stock.

39
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,450
Now let me define what expected return is.

40
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,521
Expected return, which I will denote as Er.

41
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:45,680
E stands for the expected, and this is the concept

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,900
from probability theory.

43
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,170
This would be the sum of all probabilities of each given

44
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,660
state, so state 1, 2, and 3, multiplied

45
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,170
by the net return in each of the corresponding states.

46
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,620
So p1 multiplied by the return that we'll

47
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,690
get on the stock in state 1, plus p2 times r2

48
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,450
plus p3 times r3.

49
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,760
If we have more states of nature,

50
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,030
we can write down the expected return

51
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,430
in a more compact way, as 1 all the way

52
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,080
to however many states of nature we have, let's say

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,680
n, p i times ri.

54
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,620
So the probability of each of these states of nature

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,260
multiplied by the net return in each

56
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,690
of the corresponding states.

57
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,120
So applied in our case, this would be 10% multiplied

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,850
by the return that we get in this first state, which

59
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:47,578
is 368.75%, plus 60%--

60
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:49,120
this is the probability of occurrence

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,560
of the second state--

62
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,630
multiplied by negative 37.50% return plus 30% multiplied

63
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:04,840
by negative 93.75% return.

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:16,300
If you compute this number, this would give us negative 13.75%.

65
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,820
So the expected net return on our investing

66
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:29,180
in this stock of Nikola Corporation is negative 13.75%.

67
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,770
Now let me also show you an alternative way

68
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,240
of solving this question.

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,170
What we can do is we can find the expected price of Nikola

70
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,400
stock in year one, and then use the current price

71
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,090
to find the net return.

72
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,970
So by definition, the expected price of a stock next year

73
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,910
will be the probability of each of the corresponding states

74
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,810
times the share price in that state of nature.

75
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,330
So in this case, it will be 10% multiplied

76
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:10,980
by $150 plus 60% multiplied by $20 plus 30% multiplied by $2.

77
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:18,270
If you compute the share price, we will get $27.60.

78
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,330
So right here, you already can see that, in expectation,

79
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,460
the share price of Nikola is going

80
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,300
to decline from the current price to what it

81
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,270
is going to be, or expected to be, next year.

82
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,190
Now to compute the net return, which

83
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,780
is taking the future price, the expected future price,

84
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:50,492
we'll divide it by the current price minus 1.

85
00:05:50,492 --> 00:06:00,416
And so it will be $27.60 divided by $32 minus 1.

86
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:07,520
And this number will also be negative 13.75%.

87
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,970
So both approaches give us exactly the same final result,

88
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,700
which is the net return on the stock of negative 13.75%.

89
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,850
What it implies, this expected value or what we also

90
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,830
call mean return, is based on our assessment of probabilities

91
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,870
of different states and different prices

92
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,960
of share price of Nikola in each of those different states.

93
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,070
What is the most likely return on the share

94
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,980
over the next year?
