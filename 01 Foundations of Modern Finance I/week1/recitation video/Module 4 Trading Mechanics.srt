00:00:00,355 --> 00:00:01,730
PROFESSOR: In this segment, we'll

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,640
talk about trading mechanics.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,650
Suppose you want to buy 100 shares of Uber.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,510
There are two ways of doing it.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,190
One, you can place what we call a limit order.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,990
And the second way is you can place

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,000
what we call a market order.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,150
Think of a limit order as placing

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,470
an advertising, which says how many shares and at what price

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,490
you want to buy.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,260
And think of market order as responding to an advertising

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,720
posted by someone else.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,230
So saying that you will be buying 100 shares of Uber

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,270
at the best price that is currently

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,590
available in the marketplace.

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,930
Let's consider a specific example.

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,450
On the slides, we see what we call a limit order book.

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,020
It shows us all available asking prices

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,530
right now of people or investors who are

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,220
willing to sell their shares.

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,920
In particular, the top part of the slide

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,980
shows four separate limit orders.

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,690
It says that someone is willing-- one

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,760
investor, at the very top, is willing to sell

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,418
their shares at $13.08.

26
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,460
And the number of shares they are willing to sell

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,750
at this price is 200 shares.

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,210
The investor right below is willing to sell also

29
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,470
200 shares, but at a price of $13.06.

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,080
Yet another investor is willing to sell 300 shares

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,110
at the price of $13.05.

32
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,300
And the last investor is willing to sell 100 shares

33
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,230
at a price of $13.04.

34
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,790
So this is the collection of all the offers of investors who are

35
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,160
willing to sell their shares.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,340
And they indicate the price at which they're willing to sell

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,730
and the number of shares that they are willing to sell.

38
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,060
At the bottom, we have a collection of offers

39
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,650
by investors who are willing to buy shares.

40
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,780
The first investor is willing to buy 200 shares

41
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,820
at the price of $13.02.

42
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,160
The next investor is willing to buy 300 shares

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,745
at the price of $13.01.

44
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,870
And the other investor is willing to buy 200 shares

45
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,250
at the price of $12.99.

46
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,430
So this is the collection of what we call bids or quotes

47
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,350
from investors, limit orders from investors,

48
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,820
who are willing to buy shares or the specified number of shares

49
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,740
at these specified prices.

50
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,710
There is an important definition that we

51
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,340
will make based on this slide.

52
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,970
So the difference between the best ask,

53
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:02,810
which is, in our case, $13.04, and the best bid or the best

54
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,180
price at which somebody is willing to buy

55
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,580
a share, $13.02, this difference between $13.04 and $13.02

56
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,580
is called bid-ask spread, which is

57
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:20,400
the difference between, again, lowest ask and the highest bid.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,030
Now let's try to understand what happens

59
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,320
when there is a market order that arrives to this limit

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,180
order book.

61
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,660
Suppose that there is a market order, comes in,

62
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,230
that wants to buy 200 shares.

63
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,470


64
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,420
Now, the best ask is only for 100 shares.

65
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:51,620
So somebody is willing to sell you 100 shares at $13.04.

66
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:59,850
The next best ask is 300 shares at $13.05.

67
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,130
So your order got to get executed in two batches.

68
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,970
You will buy the available 100 shares at $13.04.

69
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,790
And then you will buy the remaining 100 shares at $13.05.

70
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,560
Now after your order is executed,

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,860
let's look at how does the limit order book

72
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,130
look like after this order is executed.

73
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:28,040
So we see that because we just purchased 100 shares at $13.04,

74
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,060
there is no bottom line, which indicates that we actually

75
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,630
purchased this 100 shares at this price.

76
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,020
And the ask of $13.05 for 300 shares

77
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,330
right now indicates that there are only 200 shares available

78
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,540
at $13.05.

79
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,400
Which makes sense, because we purchased

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,260
100 of these 300 shares that were

81
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,730
available from the beginning.
