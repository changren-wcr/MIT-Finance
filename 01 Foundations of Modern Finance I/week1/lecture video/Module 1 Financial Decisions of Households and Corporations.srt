1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,310
PROFESSOR: When we think about finance, what comes to mind

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,420
may include bank accounts, stock market, mortgages,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,930
mutual funds, hedge funds, derivative securities,

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,260
venture capital, private equity, and IPOs.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,581
Of course, these are all parts of finance--

6
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:22,390
financial products, services, markets, and institutions.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,860
But in fact, finance is a lot more important and fundamental

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,680
to our economy and our welfare.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,420
It is really about how to make the best economic decisions

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,380
or how to best utilize the limited resources we have

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,170
to meet our economic needs.

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,940
We would like to illustrate this point with an example.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,570
Suppose that you are a marketing manager at a company.

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,630
You are thinking about a new marketing campaign

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,930
for your existing product line.

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,560
Independent of the details of the plan,

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,349
being online or through regular media,

18
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,460
the ultimate goal is to increase future profit

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,470
from increasing sales.

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,480
Of course, the plan could cost some money.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,140
Let's assume that the cost of the whole marketing plan

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,230
is $10 million today.

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,250
If launched, you will increase the firm's profit

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,090
from new sales by $12 million next year for sure.

25
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,430
To keep things simple, let's assume

26
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,910
this is the only benefit from this marketing plan.

27
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,180
The overall cash flow for their marketing plan,

28
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,620
which we also refer to as a project using a more generic

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,840
term, is given in the chart.

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,620
A downward arrow represents a cash outflow--

31
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,190
a negative cash flow.

32
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,930
And an upward arrow represents a cash inflow, a positive cash

33
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,600
flow.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,810
Your decision is whether to launch this project.

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,660
How do you make this decision?

36
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,860
It would be too simplistic to simply say,

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,905
our net profit is 12 minus 10.

38
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,414
That's $2 million.

39
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:22,310
Thus, this is a good deal.

40
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,040
This is because $12 million in new profits is next year and it

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,060
cannot be simply net with the $10 million of cost today.

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,350
They are money at different points in time,

43
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,090
thus cannot be compared directly.

44
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,100
But how should we compare them then?

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,300
We can also view this as an investment,

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,290
investing $10 million today and returning $12 million

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,230
next year, yielding a sure return of 20%.

48
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,470
Is a return of 20% a good deal?

49
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,040
Maybe.

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,300
Maybe not.

51
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,280
It depends.

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,780
In absence of other information, answers to these questions

53
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,860
may become a subjective judgment.

54
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,820
However, suppose now we know that one year bank

55
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,590
deposits offer a sure interest rate of 5%.

56
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,220
Then we can answer this question easily.

57
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,490
Clearly, the project offers a good deal.

58
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,430
It gives us a sure return of 20%, which

59
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,780
is much higher than one can get from other investment

60
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,850
opportunities in the financial market,

61
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:43,360
such as bank deposits, which are easily available to everyone.

62
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,950
Thus by taking on this project, we are earning higher returns

63
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,720
and thus creating value for the shareholders

64
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,760
and the society at large.

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,560
What if the interest rate in a market is 25%?

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,530
Then clearly, this is not a good project.

67
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,720
Shareholders can easily invest their money

68
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,400
in a market to earn 25%, which is higher than the return

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,110
the project gives.

70
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,830
Investing in the project would be destroying value

71
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,350
rather than creating value.

72
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,360
In the scenario above, label A in the graph,

73
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,170
we only need to value a single cash flow, $12 million

74
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,770
for sure in one year.

75
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,530
How about if the $12 million is spread over the next three

76
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,920
years, $4 million each year, shown

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,280
in the plot as scenario B?

78
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,980
In this case, we need to know how

79
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,730
to value cash flows in different points in time.

80
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,290
Given that the cash flow arrives in the future, most likely

81
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,000
they are uncertain.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,170
This is in arrow C, in which $4 million each year only

83
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,070
represents our forecast of the cash flow.

84
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,140
Its realization is uncertain.

85
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,550
It can be lower or higher than $4 million.

86
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,120
This is reflected also by the lighter blue color we

87
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,590
use to describe the cash flow.

88
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,430
In this case, the assessment of the project

89
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,510
further requires us to know how to value risky cash

90
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,160
flows in the future.

91
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,760
This example leads to two key conclusions.

92
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,380
First, a business decision-- in this case, a marketing

93
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,320
campaign-- ultimately is about how

94
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,260
to value a project or its cash flows.

95
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,670
This is fundamentally a finance problem.

96
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,640
Second, the valuation is not a subjective exercise,

97
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,180
but determined by the financial market.

98
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,610
Of course, what we call a project

99
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,920
can be any business activity.

100
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,710
It can be a marketing campaign, like the example.

101
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,572
It can also be an expansion of the current product line,

102
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,520
an R&D initiative, an acquisition

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,330
of another business, an upgrade of the current IT system,

104
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,290
the reorganization of existing workforce, and so on.

105
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,610
So finance is the basic tool we need to value these activities

106
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,480
and to make sound decisions.

107
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,890
The previous example illustrates the fundamental importance

108
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,620
of finance in economic decision making.

109
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,210
It is about the bottom line of any business activity.

110
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,580
More generally, a business activity

111
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,610
involves acquiring and disposing assets.

112
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,870
Here, an asset refers to anything and everything

113
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,500
that is of economic value.

114
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,640
Its shape and form can be very generic.

115
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,200
It can be a real asset, like a plant and machinery,

116
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,660
or a financial asset, like cash and bonds.

117
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,870
It can be tangible, like land and stocks,

118
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,740
or intangible, like brand name, goodwill, and ideas.

119
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,330
All business activities serve two basic economic functions.

120
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,485
One, to grow wealth or create value, and two,

121
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:29,200
to manage existing wealth to best meet future economic needs

122
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,510
as shown by the previous example we have just discussed.

123
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,600
Therefore, a business decision starts

124
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,300
with the valuation of assets.

125
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,650
You can't create and manage what you can't measure.

126
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,200
Value is an objective measure.

127
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,860
It is determined by the financial market.

128
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,570
Valuation is the central issue of finance and business

129
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,680
decision making.

130
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,630
So the questions we would like to answer in this course

131
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,870
are as follows.

132
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,670
First, how to value assets.

133
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,180
As we've seen, all business decision makings

134
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,820
first require the proper valuation

135
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,010
of the assets involved.

136
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,010
Second, how should firms make sound financial decisions?

137
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,650
For example, what projects to invest in?

138
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,970
That's sometimes also called capital budgeting

139
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,870
or real investment decisions.

140
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,370
How to finance a project--

141
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,840
that's a financing decision by either issuing financial claims

142
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:43,010
or securities, such as loans, bonds, and stocks.

143
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,320
Third, what to pay to shareholders.

144
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,340
That's often referred to as pay out policy.

145
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,420
And also, what risk to take on or to avoid.

146
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,150
And that's sometimes also referred to as risk management.

147
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:05,310
And third, how should households make financial decisions?

148
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,200
We will address these questions by developing and applying

149
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,220
a unified analytical framework and a set of basic finance

150
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,370
principles.
