00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,300
PROFESSOR: The idea of no free lunch

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,000
is essential in asset valuation.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Thus, we will develop it a bit more formally.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,880
A free lunch, or an arbitrage opportunity

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,490
in the financial market, is a set

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,390
of trades based only market information, such

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,350
that it meets three conditions.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,612
First, it requires non-positive initial investment.

9
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,320
The initial investment could be negative,

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,080
meaning a cash inflow.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,580
Two, it yields non-negative future payoffs,

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,950
at least with some likelihood.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,590
Third, at least one of the above inequalities is strict.

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,100
It is important to emphasize that these trades are based

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,150
on market information only.

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,080
They do not rely on any private information.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,330
Therefore, if they do exist, they

18
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,390
will be available to everybody participating in a market.

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,260


20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,800
Let's now consider a simple example

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,670
of an arbitrage opportunity.

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,150
Suppose that Citibank, a large commercial bank,

23
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,290
offers a 12 month lending rate of 1%.

24
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,990
Chase, another large commercial bank,

25
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,390
is selling 12 month certificates of deposit, also called a CD,

26
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,860
at an interest rate of 1.125%, assuming no default risk

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,850
on Chase CDs.

28
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,750
These two prices then present an arbitrage opportunity.

29
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,090
Let's consider the following set of trades.

30
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,260
First, borrow money from Citibank,

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,920
say $100, at the interest rate of 1%.

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:59,910
Buy $100 of CD from Chase at 1.125% interest rate.

33
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,060
The current cash flow in net is zero.

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,730
We don't need to put in any money.

35
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:12,360
In one year we will receive $101.125 from Chase,

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,780
earning the 1.125% interest.

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,670
After paying 101 to Citi, with 1% interest,

38
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,420
we are left with $0.125 for sure.

39
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,670
This is a free lunch.

40
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,970
If so, we'll do more than $100.

41
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,610
How about $100 million?

42
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,550
Well, in that case, the arbitrage profit

43
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,880
would be $125,000.

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,900
How about more?

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,770
Well, as we keep borrowing money from Citi,

46
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,120
it will eventually raise its lending rate above 1%.

47
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,820
As we buy more CDs from Chase, it

48
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,010
will start lowering the CD rate below 1.125%.

49
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,820
Soon, the rates converge, the arbitrage opportunity

50
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,440
disappears, and the market stabilizes.

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,490
Now let's consider another example.

52
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,010
Suppose that IBM shares are traded on the New York Stock

53
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,270
Exchange, or NYSE, at $195 per share.

54
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,370
And they are also traded on London Stock Exchange, or LSE.

55
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,060
At 120 pounds per share.

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,420
And the pound dollar exchange rate is $1.50 for a pound.

57
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,970
In absence of any frictions, this situation

58
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,160
also provides an arbitrage opportunity.

59
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,020
Let's consider the following set of trades.

60
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,590
Sell one share of IBM on NYSE, yielding $195.

61
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,380
Converting the $195 into pounds, at $1.50 per pound,

62
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,870
that's going to give us 130 pounds.

63
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,860
Buying one share of IBM on LSE, costing 120 pounds, in net,

64
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,620
we are left with 10 pounds today with zero net cash

65
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,470
roll in the future.

66
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,019
One share sold in New York is offset by the one

67
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,269
share bought in London.

68
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,420
Clearly this is an arbitrage.

69
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,080
Giving us 10 pounds today with no future cash flows.

70
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,050
Of course, as we carry out these arbitrage trades

71
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,970
at large quantities, the IBM share price on NYSE

72
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,660
will decrease, as we're selling IBM shares there,

73
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,780
and its price on LSE will increase until the arbitrage

74
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,300
opportunity disappears.

75
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,850
Such a process, as you can imagine,

76
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,720
happens almost instantaneously with automated trading

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,800
these days.

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,830
Therefore, as a good first order approximation,

79
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,800
there should be no arbitrage opportunities in the well

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,490
functioning financial market.
