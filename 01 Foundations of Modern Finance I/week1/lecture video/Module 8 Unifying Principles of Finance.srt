1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,340
PROFESSOR: We have now defined what

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,720
finance is about and the two basic problems in finance.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,540
One, how to value assets and two,

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,440
how to maximize wealth and utilize it to best meet

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,180
our economic needs.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,350
In the remainder of this course, we will tackle these problems

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,640
in a wide range of contexts using the basic ideas

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,540
and analytical framework we have laid down.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,040
In doing so, we will be applying a few simple principles,

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,030
which we now describe.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,630
Principle number one-- there's no free lunch

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,085
in the financial market.

13
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,210
As we have seen that the idea behind this principle

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,500
is quite simple--

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,670
any free lunch, if it appears, will be taken advantage

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,970
of by some market participants, which will then

17
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,580
eliminate the free lunch.

18
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,050
With the efficiency of the financial market,

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,280
which means that investors-- at least some of them--

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,010
can trade or create financial assets

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,610
easily in the market in large quantities.

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,000
Such a process happened very quickly.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,260
It is important to know that the same cannot be said for other

24
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,030
markets, such as the goods market or the labor market.

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,790


26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,160
Principle number two-- other things

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,830
equal, individuals or market participants behave as follows.

28
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,700
One, prefer more money to less.

29
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,070
This is sometimes also caught non-satiation.

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,650
Two, prefer to avoid risk.

31
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,990
This is also called risk aversion.

32
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,500
Three, prefer money now to later.

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,450
This is sometimes also called impatience.

34
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,960
More is better than less should be obvious.

35
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,420
Risk aversion is easy to understand,

36
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,490
and we will discuss it further when

37
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,810
we do our risk analysis later.

38
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,740
Impatience is less obvious, but also less important

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,160
for most of our analysis.

40
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,560
It's listed here mostly for completeness.

41
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,760
In fact, as we have said, all we can and need to say

42
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,360
is that the market on average behaves this way.

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,780
This behavior is consistent with the return and risk

44
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,450
patterns for various asset classes

45
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,110
with different timing and risk characteristics, which we will

46
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,870
see from the data later on.

47
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,570
There is no reason nor need to assume

48
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,240
that everyone behaves this way.

49
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,450
Principal number three-- financial market prices

50
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,530
shift to equate supply and demand.

51
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,930
In economics, this is also called a market equilibrium.

52
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,290
Given the strong market forces in the well-functioning

53
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,680
financial market, prices quickly adjust to market equilibrium.

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,080
We have already seen an example of this

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,580
in the case of price reactions to dividend announcements.

56
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,880
Principal number four, market imperfections

57
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,030
are central to financial innovation.

58
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,180
Real markets do have imperfections

59
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,780
in different forms and to different x degrees.

60
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,440
They do cause inefficiencies in the market--

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,740
for example, price deviations from no arbitrage

62
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,410
relationships.

63
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:38,500
These deviations also represent potential profit opportunities.

64
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,820
Financial innovations to overcome the imperfections

65
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,700
in the market lead to the realization

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,900
of these profits and their eventual disappearance.

67
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,860
We will see plenty of examples of various innovations

68
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,680
in different situations.
