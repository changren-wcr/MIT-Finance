00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,310
PROFESSOR: Economic decisions boil

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,630
down to the transformation of assets or economic resources

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,280
in general we will start our analysis by first describing

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,210
the existing assets of an economic decision maker, which

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,280
can be a firm or a household.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,300
To begin, let's first focus on a firm.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,660
A description of the firm's assets

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,670
it's also referred to as part of its balance sheet.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,170
The table on a slide illustrates a simple balance sheet.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,380
The left-hand side lists all the assets of the firm.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,730
It can contain cash, the most liquid asset, capital,

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,290
the other tangible assets, and then intangible assets.

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,290
Adding up the value of the firm's assets

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,590
gives the firm's total value as shown

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,710
by the bottom row in the table.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,620
It's often the case that the firm does not

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,050
solely on its assets.

18
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,660
For example, part of the assets may

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,960
be financed by borrowing, in which case

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,490
the lenders also have some claim on the firm's assets.

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,400
Thus, the right-hand side of the balance sheet

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,120
is used to describe the firm's liabilities,

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,430
namely claims on the firm's assets.

24
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,480
In the simple case we show here, the liabilities

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,220
consist of two parts, debt, denoted by D,

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:40,160
and equity, denoted by E. D represents the lender's claim

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,330
on the firm's assets, while E represents the equity holders'

28
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:50,020
claim both in the form of their market value.

29
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,230
Of course, if we add up all the liabilities, that

30
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,720
is all the claims on the firm, it

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,880
must equal all of the firm's assets or their total value.

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,640
Thus, the total value of all assets

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,470
must equal to the total value of all the liabilities.

34
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,370
We can call this the conservation of value.

35
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,160
Balance sheet properly describes a firm's

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,020
current financial status.

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,110
Of course, a firm's economic or financial status

38
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,910
does not stay constant.

39
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,690
It evolves over time.

40
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,890
This evolution is driven by the firm's flow of funds.

41
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,520
This flow is described by the firm's income statement.

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,080
The income statement also has two parts, the source of funds

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,850
and the use of funds.

44
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,460
Of course, the two must be equal.

45
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:51,730
We can also call this the conservation of funds or money.

46
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,440
For the source of funds, there are three parts,

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,470
funds generated by the existing assets,

48
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,940
such as earnings or interest from cash assets.

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,650
We denote this by net income or NI.

50
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,420
Funds raised by issuing new debt,

51
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,950
such as new loans or bonds, we denote this by delta D.

52
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,630
The third source of funds come from issuing new equity.

53
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,620
We denote this by delta E. For the use of funds,

54
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,260
there are four parts.

55
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,990
The first part is investments into new projects, denoted

56
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,720
by I. The second part is the coupon

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,710
interest or principal payments on existing debt, denoted by C.

58
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,250
The third part is the dividend payment to shareholders,

59
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,490
denoted by Div.

60
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:57,790
And the last part is taxes paid to tax authorities, which

61
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,980
we denote by T.

62
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,000
Given the flow of funds, the firm's balance sheet

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,800
changes over time.

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,100
On the asset side, new investments

65
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,240
will add to capital and possibly other items, too.

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,680
On the liability side, new debt and equity issues

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,980
add to existing debt and equity, respectively.

68
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,870
Let's now consider a firm's financial decisions, which

69
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,670
are illustrated in the graph.

70
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,090
On the firm's manager, the left-hand side box

71
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,880
represents the firm's business operations.

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,000
The right-hand side box represents

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,300
the financial market.

74
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,510
As far as the firm's bottom line is concerned,

75
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,810
the manager's decisions lead to the falling five cash flows.

76
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,260
Cash flow one-- funds raised from investors

77
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,730
by selling financial claims, delta D and delta E. Cash flow

78
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,300
two represents funds invested in the firm's

79
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,700
operations or real assets, which is denoted by I.

80
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,220
Cash flow three represents funds generated

81
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,260
by the firm's operations.

82
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,890
It should be after tax.

83
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:24,280
So that should equal to NI, the Net Income, minus taxes.

84
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,200
The fourth cash flow, cash flow four

85
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,900
gives funds return to investors in the form of interests

86
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,950
and dividends.

87
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,680
We denote that by C plus Div.

88
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,370
Cash flow five gives funds retained

89
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,770
for the firm's operations.

90
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,330
And that should equal to Net Income, NI, minus Taxes, T,

91
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,840
minus coupon payments minus dividend payments.

92
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,760
Thus, managerial decisions really

93
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,300
reduce to the management of four cash flows, cash flow one, two,

94
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,710
four, and five.

95
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,160
The first set of decisions about real investments

96
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,530
or capital budgeting, this is shown

97
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,800
by the left-hand side of the plot

98
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,150
involving cash flow two and three.

99
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,870
As we have seen before, how to make these real investment

100
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,110
decisions really boils down to valuation of real assets.

101
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,370
The second set of decisions involve financing and pay out

102
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,040
decisions, as shown by the right-hand side

103
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,810
of the plot involving cash flow one, four, and five.

104
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,450
Of course, in order to make good decisions on these activities,

105
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,770
we would need to know how to value financial assets.

106
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,310
The third set of decisions are risk management decisions

107
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,310
associated with cash flow one and four.

108
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,280
And that involves transactions between the firm

109
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,510
and the financial market.

110
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,050
And of course, in order to make these risk management

111
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,600
decisions, we would need to know how

112
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,990
to value financial contracts.

113
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,920
The objective for the manager is to create maximum value

114
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,030
for shareholders.

115
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,530
The right decisions in achieving this goal critically

116
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:26,570
rely on how to correctly value assets, real and financial.

117
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,970
We can use the same method to analyze

118
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,160
a household's financial decisions,

119
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,880
also shown in the graph.

120
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,340
The left-hand side box represents

121
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,160
the household's real economic activities,

122
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,100
such as working, private business,

123
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,940
or investing in human capital, like education.

124
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,470
The right-hand side box represents the financial market

125
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,510
and the financial institutions a household interacts with.

126
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,180
Financially, the household's decisions

127
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,050
lead to the following five cash flows.

128
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,980
Cash flow one-- funds raised from financial institutions

129
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,160
or from holdings in financial assets,

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,520
such as borrowing from a bank or selling the house stock

131
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,320
holdings.

132
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,480
Cash flow two represents funds or resources

133
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,680
invested in real assets.

134
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,900
Cash flow three describes funds or assets

135
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,700
generated by real assets.

136
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,860
Cash flow four gives funds returned

137
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,090
to financial institutions or invested in financial assets.

138
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,350
And the last piece, cash flow five,

139
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:43,000
describes funds and resources consumed by the household

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,620
or saved for future consumption.

141
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,560
Therefore, a household's financial decisions really

142
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,110
reduce to the management of four cash flows, cash flow one, two,

143
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,330
four, and five in the graph.

144
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,160
Again, they represent three sets of decisions,

145
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,930
real investments shown by the left-hand side involving cash

146
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,940
flow two and three.

147
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,560
Making these decisions involves valuing real assets.

148
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,430
Second set of decisions represent consumption, saving,

149
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,050
and investment, as shown by the right-hand side

150
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,460
of the graph involving cash flow one, four, and five.

151
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,560
Of course, these decisions rely on valuing financial assets

152
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,710
and how to best use them.

153
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,320
The third set of decisions are risk management decisions

154
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,170
involving cash flow one and four.

155
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,920
And these decisions critically rely on the valuation

156
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,860
of financial contracts.

157
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,360
The objective for a household is to maximize lifetime happiness

158
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,180
or welfare, or sometimes we call it utility.

159
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,850
How to achieve this goal relies on how

160
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,940
to value assets, real or financial,

161
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,500
and how to best deploy them to meet economic needs.

162
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,000
