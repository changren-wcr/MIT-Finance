00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
PROFESSOR: Finally, we want to summarize

1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,570
the basic economic functions of the financial market.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,600
First, it allows market participants

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,700
to allocate resources to best meet the economic needs.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,200
The allocation is in two dimensions across time

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,530
and across different states of the economy.

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:28,800
Let's consider two simple examples as an illustration.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,900
The first is allocation across time.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,920
A good example here will be a household

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,340
borrow money to buy a home.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,480
In this case, the household is moving future resources,

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,390
like future income, to finance current housing consumption.

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,680
The second example is allocation across different states

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,510
of the economy.

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,600
Here, we can think of a household investing

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,030
in stocks or bonds.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,300
Here, depending on where the household

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,910
is going to allocate its wealth, it's

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,350
actually shifting its wealth towards or away

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,350
from good states of economy.

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,390
Second, the financial market provides a powerful mechanism

21
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,820
to determine asset prices based on current information.

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,790
This function is also referred to as price discovery.

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,160
In order to illustrate the price discovery

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:39,020
process in the financial market, let's consider an example.

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,780
What is shown in the left figure is a stock's price reaction

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,230
in the US market when the firm announces

27
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,230
a decrease in its dividend.

28
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,870
The x-axis is time.

29
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,460
The point marked by AD is the announcement date.

30
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,930
To its left are the dates before the announcement minus 3

31
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,270
is three days before, and minus 10 is 10 days before.

32
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,020
To the right are the days after the announcement.

33
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,980
2 is 2 days after the announcement and 10

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,670
is 10 days after.

35
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,570
The y-axis yes the stock price change in percentage.

36
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,760
A decrease in dividend is typically

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,710
viewed as bad news for the company.

38
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,660
We will return to the question of why when we discuss

39
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,430
corporate finance issues later.

40
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,980


41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,170
Therefore, the stock price drops substantially for about 4.6%

42
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,480
on average on the announcement day.

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,690
There's nothing necessarily surprising about this.

44
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,130
What is surprising however, is that the price drops

45
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:02,210
to the right level, that is by minus 4.6%, almost immediately.

46
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,090
This shows the market is incredibly

47
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,080
efficient in figuring out what the implication

48
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,960
of the negative dividend news for the firm

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,050
and in discovering the right new stock price.

50
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,200


51
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,000
The figure on the right-hand side

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,970
shows the stock price adjustment in response

53
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,020
to announcements on dividend increases.

54
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,850
In this case, the stock price increases by about 1%.

55
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,270
Again, it reaches this level very quickly.

56
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,600


57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,200
This example demonstrates how the financial market

58
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,770
facilitates the formation of asset prices

59
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,780
in reflecting new information on relevant economic fundamentals.

60
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,000
We will return to this issue later

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,760
when we discuss the information or efficiency

62
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,410
of the financial market.

63
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,680
In our discussion of the financial market

64
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,950
and its role in asset valuation, we

65
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,500
mentioned that a well-functioning market

66
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,400
should be absent of frictions.

67
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,800
Before moving on with this notion,

68
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,220
we should have some clarification about it.

69
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,060
Market frictions, also called market imperfections,

70
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,780
typically referred to the following.

71
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,610
The first kind of market frictions is transaction costs.

72
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,710
They can come in different shapes and forms.

73
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,620
For example, markets may be missing for certain assets.

74
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,840
That means the cost of trading these assets is prohibitively

75
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,400
high.

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,630
Some markets may be there, but it's

77
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,960
costly to access them to participate in these markets.

78
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,470
When we can trade in a market, we

79
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,220
may also have to pay trading costs which

80
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:08,640
may include commissions, bid ask spreads, and so on.

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,050
In some markets, we also face position or trading

82
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,010
constraints.

83
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,270
For example, there might be limits on how large a position

84
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,270
we can take.

85
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,690
The second kind of market frictions

86
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,540
involve information asymmetry.

87
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,610
This could be information asymmetry

88
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,120
between a firm's different stakeholders,

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,560
like bondholders and stockholders.

90
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,060
It could be information and symmetry

91
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,020
between corporate managers and the financial market

92
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,930
or between different market participants.

93
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,620
The third kind of market frictions are taxes.

94
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,360
They include corporate taxes and personal taxes.

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,220
Our analysis always starts with a financial market

96
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,340
without frictions as the benchmark.

97
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,510
Actual markets do have frictions which will be considered

98
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,330
when needed.
