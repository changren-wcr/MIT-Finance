00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
PROFESSOR: From our discussion so far,

1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,090
we have arrived at two basic conclusions.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,420
First, business decisions boil down to how to value assets.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,010
And two, asset valuation is determined

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,680
by the financial market.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,440
Therefore, the financial market is playing

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,470
a central role in the economy.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,110
It is where asset prices are determined

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,620
which are guiding the decisions of firms and households

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,100
at the micro level and the allocation of resources

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,670
across different economic activities at the macro level.

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,200
For this reason, we will spend a large part of the course

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,230
to study the financial market.

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,760
Before now, we would like to take a broad perspective

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,140
on the fundamental functions of the financial market

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,420
in economy.

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,340
Generally speaking, an economy consists of three markets--

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,610
the labor market, the product market,

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,470
and the financial market, broadly

19
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,690
defined which also includes financial intermediaries.

20
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,230
The first two markets are sometimes also referred to

21
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,900
as the real economy.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,430
The end players in these markets are households

23
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,110
and non-financial firms.

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,070
Financial firms are typically included

25
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,460
as part of the broad financial market,

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,660
therefore going forward what we call firms will typically

27
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,310
refer to non-financial firms just for simplicity.

28
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,290
Firms and households participate in the labor and product market

29
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,880
to produce and to consume goods and services.

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,720
In order to do so, they need the financial market.

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,350
For example, they all rely on the payment system

32
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,290
to exchange goods and services.

33
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,630
Firms often need to take out loans or issue bonds and stocks

34
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,560
to raise funds for its production process.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,600
Households often need to borrow money

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,510
from banks for current consumption

37
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,150
or save money for future consumption.

38
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,440
These services are all provided by the financial market.

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,260
It is through these financial services

40
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,820
and the key role of asset prices in guiding economic decisions

41
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,260
and resource allocation that financial market is driving

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,810
the economic activities.

43
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,410
Therefore, the effective financial market

44
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,530
is the foundation of a modern economy.

45
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,170
It is at the center of the economic universe.

46
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,840


47
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,560
Let's now take a quick look at the general structure

48
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,590
of the financial market.

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,530
Roughly speaking, it consists of two parts.

50
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,850
One, securities market where financial assets

51
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,950
are traded more directly, and two, financial intermediaries

52
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,740
where financial assets or contracts are

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,650
traded more indirectly.

54
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,380
Examples of major financial intermediaries

55
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,880
include commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds,

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,640
and insurance companies.

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,770
We can look at the financial market in slight more detail.

58
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,520
The securities market consist of a large array

59
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,090
of financial assets or contracts.

60
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,410
They are roughly categorized by the timing and risk

61
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,650
of their payoffs or cash flows.

62
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,860
The first category is the money market.

63
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,280
It consists of short-term debt securities

64
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,210
issued by governments, banks, and corporations

65
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:59,840
such as Treasury Bills, CDs, and commercial papers.

66
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,610
These securities have relatively short maturities, no more

67
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,790
than a year, and low risks.

68
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,570
The next category is the capital market

69
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,540
which consists of securities with longer

70
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,589
maturities and higher risks.

71
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,329
It can be further divided into two parts, bonds and stocks,

72
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,230
with increasing maturity and risk.

73
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,950
The third category is the derivative securities market

74
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,970
which includes forwards and futures, swaps, and options.

75
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,470
We will examine each of these market in more detail later.

76
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,590
Financial intermediaries are institutions

77
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,750
who mediate financial transactions

78
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,960
among firms and households.

79
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,980
They mostly own financial assets.

80
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,490
Prominent examples of financial intermediaries

81
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,000
include commercial banks, insurance companies, savings

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,990
and loans, as well as mutual funds, hedge funds, investment

83
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,940
banks, private equity funds.

84
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,820
The end user of securities market

85
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,780
in financial intermediaries are non-financial firms,

86
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,810
households, and governments.

87
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,840
Non-financial firms own mostly real assets

88
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,450
while households and governments own

89
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,950
both real and financial assets.
