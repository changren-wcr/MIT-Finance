00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,476
PROFESSOR: Now, let's return to the basic valuation problem.

1
00:00:04,476 --> 00:00:09,540
In example one, we considered a safe cash flow.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,520
What if it's risky?

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,690
We can apply the same idea.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,620
Suppose that we're looking at an asset that yields a risky cash

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,900
flow in one year of an expected a value of $1,000.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,040
How much is it worth today?

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,250
Again, we'll look into the financial market.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,000
Suppose that assets traded in the financial market

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,670
with the same timing and risk offer

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,230
an expected return of 10%.

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,280
Assets like this could be stocks of similar risks.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,760


13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,070
With that information, let's think

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,170
about a potential buyer of the asset under consideration.

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,410
She would also expect an annual return of 10%

16
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,780
because she is bearing the same on the risk.

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,760
Let the price of this risky asset be x.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,300
And again, x times 1 plus 10%, the expected return

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,460
on this kind of assets, should equal to $1,000.

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,850
That's the expected payoff from this asset.

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,470
This will gives us the current market value for this asset

22
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,990
to be $1,000 divided by 1 plus 10%, the expected

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,640
rate of return.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,770
This gives us $909.

25
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,980
This should be the current market

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:51,340
value for this risky cash flow of $1,000 in one year.

27
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,570
Summarizing what we have learned from the two examples,

28
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,960
we arrive at the following three important results.

29
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,310
First, in the well-functioning, meaning frictionless,

30
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,900
financial market, there should be no arbitrage opportunities.

31
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,950
This is also referred to as the no arbitrage condition

32
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,790
for the financial market, a key idea in no analysis.

33
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,680
This is simply because in absence

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,790
of any cause or restrictions, any arbitrage opportunity

35
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,900
will be eliminated quickly, often instantaneously,

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,360
by investors choice to take advantage of them.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,670
In reality, however, there could be

38
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,020
frictions in the market such as transaction costs, trading

39
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,170
constraints, information asymmetry.

40
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,630
These frictions can hinder the workings of market forces.

41
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,020
For example, you may see prices in the market which

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,160
seem to allow arbitrage, but various costs

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,470
can prevent the actual arbitrage trades from being profitable.

44
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,710
In this case, we make three observations.

45
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,790
First, strictly speaking, these are not

46
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,430
to arbitrage opportunities.

47
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,280
In the presence of frictions such as trading costs,

48
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,480
we also need to include these costs in defining an arbitrage.

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,460
Two, the extent that frictions are not very severe,

50
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,030
at least for some market participants, the no arbitrage

51
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,230
conditions should still hold pretty well at least

52
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,270
as a first order approximation.

53
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,310
Three, if we see substantial and persistent violations

54
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,910
of no arbitrage condition, they are usually not

55
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,300
sustainable because investors will eventually

56
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,240
find ways to overcome the frictions

57
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,900
and take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,350
We will return to these points later in this lecture.

59
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,990
We should also point out that we don't

60
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,940
need all market participants to face limited frictions.

61
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,550
It is sufficient if only some of them do.

62
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,829


63
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,800
Second, from the no arbitrage condition,

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,690
we can also conclude that assets with the same payoffs

65
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,220
should have the same prices.

66
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,260
This is also called the Law of One Price.

67
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,060
Obviously, violations of Law of One Price or LOP

68
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,170
also violate the no arbitrage condition.

69
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,860
You may have seen LOP in other economic contexts

70
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,200
like international trade.

71
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,430
The difference is that in a mature financial market,

72
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,000
it actually works pretty well.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,720
The reason is, again, that in the financial market,

74
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,000
frictions are much less significant.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,940
Third, with the rich and well-functioning

76
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,920
financial market, all assets can be valued or priced

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,150
by the market or the prices of traded assets.

78
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,960
Here, rich means that there is a large set

79
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,580
of traded assets with cash flows covering the whole range

80
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,130
in time and risk.

81
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,650
We'll be more specific about this point

82
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,750
in our later discussions.

83
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,660
For now, it is sufficient to point out

84
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,060
that in the global financial market,

85
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,640
there are tens if not hundreds of thousands

86
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,450
of primary financial securities, such as bonds, stocks,

87
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,220
and asset backed securities traded in very liquid markets,

88
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,460
not to mention our limited number of derivative securities

89
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,770
and financial contracts.

90
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,820
The financial market is indeed a rich and fast expanding

91
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,170
universe.

92
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,280
We will return to this topic soon.
