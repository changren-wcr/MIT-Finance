1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,670
PROFESSOR: We now turn our attention

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,940
to the valuation of assets.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,080
The asset can be a real asset like an investment project

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,640
or a financial asset like a bond or stock.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,890
Each asset is fully defined by its future cash flow.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,490
Its cash flow can have many pieces occurring

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,750
at different points in time from time 0, which is today,

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,009
to times 1, 2, et cetera.

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,330
To be concrete, we can describe an asset's cash flow

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,950
in the table, listing each piece of outflow and inflow

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,460
over the asset's lifespan.

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,060
Let the initial cash flow be CF0,

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,580
which can be negative in the case of initial investment.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,680
The cash flow in year 1 be CF1 and so on.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,800
The valuation of an asset is then

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,000
equivalent to the valuation of its cash flow.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,910
For convenience, sometimes we also

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,540
draw a flow chart to describe a cash flow

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,450
as shown in the figure here like what we

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,180
did in our beginning example.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,260
Again, a downward arrow represents a cash outflow,

22
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,150
while an upward arrow represents a cash inflow.

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,900
When we consider a cash flow, other than its magnitude,

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,540
it has two important characteristics.

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,000
The first is time.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,480
Let's now consider two cash flows

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,640
in the first example on the slide,

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,180
$1,000 today and $1,000 next year.

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,740
They have the same magnitude but arrive at different times.

30
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,050
Which one would you prefer?

31
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,650
In general, people are not indifferent between these two

32
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,150
cash flows.

33
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,350
The fact that market interest rates are typically positive

34
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,400
suggest that market participants on average

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,960
prefers $1,000 today over later.

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,030
We will return to this topic later.

37
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,750
But for the moment, the point we want to establish

38
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,700
is simply that the timing of a cash flow matters.

39
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,760
How much it matters is what we refer

40
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,830
to as the time value of money.

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,520
The second important characteristic of a cash flow

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,620
is its risk.

43
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,070
To see this, let's consider the two cash flows

44
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,400
in the second example on the slide.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,990
Cash flow one on the left-hand side is $1,000 for sure.

46
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,040
There's no uncertainty here.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,890
Cash flow two, which is on the right-hand side,

48
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,840
will be $2,000 or $0 with equal chances.

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,970
The expected value of this cash flow

50
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,660
is still 1,000, same as the first one.

51
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,010
But it is risky.

52
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,480


53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,990
Which one of these two cash flows would you prefer?

54
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,260
Different people may have different preferences.

55
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,880
In the market often, cash flow two, which is risky,

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,540
will be selling for a lower price than cash flow one.

57
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,570
We will spend more time to understand this difference

58
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,285
later.

59
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:32,350
But for now, the key point for us

60
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,680
is that the uncertainty or risk of a cash flow

61
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,050
matters for its valuation.

62
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,340
How much it matters is often called the risk premium.

63
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,900


64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,870
Therefore, we conclude that time and risk

65
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,270
are the two key elements in finance

66
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,850
because they are critical in the valuation of assets.

67
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,410
How can we value or price a cash flow on an asset then?

68
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,930
We will devote a lot of time to develop

69
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,670
a set of tools and techniques to help us solving this problem.

70
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,760
For now, we will use a couple of simple examples

71
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,959
to illustrate the key idea behind our general approach.

72
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,820
Let's consider an asset which yields a cash flow in one

73
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,420
year of a sure value of $1,000.

74
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,820
How much is it worth today?

75
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,670
In order to have an objective valuation,

76
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,570
we can look into the financial market for similar assets

77
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,315
and their prices.

78
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:40,360


79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,420
Suppose that assets or cash flows

80
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,540
traded in the financial market with the same timing and risk

81
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,770
offer a return of 5%.

82
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,725
A good example of these assets would be one year US government

83
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:56,225
bonds.

84
00:04:56,225 --> 00:05:01,360


85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,130
The prices of these bonds then will give us

86
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:11,460
a market-based valuation for the cash flow

87
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,650
that we would like to value.

88
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,010
Let's think about the following.

89
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,190
A potential buyer of the asset also

90
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,520
expects a sure return of 5%, the same as what the one year

91
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,950
US government bonds offer.

92
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:35,670
Let the price of the asset we like to value be x.

93
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,730
Then x times 1 plus the expected 5% of return

94
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:47,420
should equal to the payoff in one year, which is the $1,000.

95
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,690
Solving for x, the current price gives us 1,000 divide by 1

96
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,980
plus 5%, and that is $952.

97
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,900
This gives us the assets current market value.

98
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:10,470
What if the asset can be traded at a higher price, say 960?

99
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,020
This will then lead to what we call a free lunch.

100
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,340
Let's consider the following set of trades.

101
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,750


102
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,930
First, buy $952 worth of one-year US treasury

103
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,950
bonds, which will pay $1,000 in one year

104
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:37,310
at a 5% interest rate, the same as the asset.

105
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,610
Next, we sell this sure cash flow

106
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,310
of $1,000 in one year for $960 today.

107
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,720
These two trades will net a positive cash flow today,

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,300
which is 960 minus 952.

109
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,940
That equals $8.

110
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,890
There will be no future cash flows.

111
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:08,890
This is a free lunch, a no-risk profitable opportunity.

112
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,550
Naturally, free lunches will be eaten very quickly

113
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,590
in the effective financial market.

114
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,250
In particular, sophisticated market participants

115
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,250
will make these trades at large quantities

116
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,160
until the price deviation disappears.

117
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,970


118
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,760
Therefore, if there are no frictions, that

119
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,550
is, hurdles preventing free lunches to be taken,

120
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,140
such as trading costs and constrains,

121
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:46,540
the price of the asset can't be higher than $952.

122
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:53,820
What if the price of this cash flow is below $952?

123
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,540
Or in this case, we will also have a free lunch.

124
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,750
All we have to do is to reverse the trades we

125
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,140
did in the previous situation.

126
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,790
I will leave that as an exercise for you.

127
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,080
To summarize, given the prices of similar assets traded

128
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,950
in the market, the price of a sure cash flow

129
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,460
of $1,000 in one year must be exactly

130
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,800
$952, not higher, not lower.

131
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,080
This example gives us the key idea in asset valuation.

132
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,549
In order to value an asset, we can find a traded asset

133
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,400
with the same cash flow in the market.

134
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,500
The price of the traded asset then

135
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,830
should give the current market value of the asset

136
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,750
under consideration.

137
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,450
The logic behind this idea comes from the fact

138
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,840
that an effective financial market should not

139
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,200
allow free lunches.
