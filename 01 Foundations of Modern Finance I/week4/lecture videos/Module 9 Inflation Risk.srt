1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,360
PROFESSOR: We now consider another important dimension

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,780
of bond risk, which is inflation risk.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,150
Bond payoffs are nominal.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,750
As a result, as the price level changes,

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,830
as inflation rate changes, the real value of the bond

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,120
is affected.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,030
Real payoffs are affected by inflation.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,030
So let's recall what inflation is.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,150
Inflation is the rate of change of the nominal price level.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,960
If you're thinking about prices of consumption goods,

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
let's say the price of a burger, it may be $5 this year

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,680
and $6 five years from now.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,710
What this means is that, for the same consumption good,

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,140
the nominal price level is changing

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,860
by 20% over a five-year period.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,830
This process of changes in nominal prices

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,910
is what we call inflation.

18
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,910
As the price level rises, the real value

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,790
of the purchasing power of a single unit of money,

20
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,280
let's say of $1, falls.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,300
So the purchasing power of currency and the price level

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,130
are negatively related.

23
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,180
As a result, payoffs of nominal securities, like bonds,

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,100
are sensitive to inflation.

25
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,410
As inflation rises, the real value of the payoffs declines.

26
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,270
So let's look at the following example

27
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,140
to illustrate the point.

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,520
Suppose that inflation next year, realized inflation rate,

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,520
is uncertain.

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,310
On average, we expect inflation to be 8%.

31
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,730
But in reality, it could be higher or lower.

32
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,980
Let's say that there are three possible values equally

33
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,480
likely--

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,870
10%, 8%, or 6.

35
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,120
The real interest rate is 2%.

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,440
This is the risk-free rate of return in real terms,

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,420
not in nominal terms.

38
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,020
The 1-year nominal interest rate is approximately 10%

39
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,970
to correct for inflation.

40
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,540
As a result, depending on the realized inflation,

41
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,290
the real return on the 1-year Treasury bond

42
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,920
is going to be different.

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,910
If inflation happens to be 8%, exactly as expected,

44
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,000
the nominal payoff of the bond, which is $1,100,

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,810
is going to be worth $1,019 in real terms.

46
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,990
If inflation happens to be higher than expected,

47
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,050
the 10%, the same nominal payoff is going to be worth only 1,000

48
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,460
in real terms.

49
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,310
If inflation is lower, 6%, that payoff

50
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,750
is going to be more valuable.

51
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,540
It's going to be $1,038.

52
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,930
The point is that while nominal securities, like Treasury

53
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,350
bonds, may produce safe payoffs in nominal terms,

54
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,920
the payoff is risky in real terms.

55
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,380
Inflation risk is particularly important

56
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,960
for long-horizon investors, who are concerned

57
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,453
with accumulating wealth.

58
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:50,870
For example, if you're thinking about the household saving

59
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,690
for retirement, it would care a lot

60
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,120
about the purchasing power of their savings rather than

61
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,670
the nominal value.

62
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,600
And, for them, inflation risk would be a first order concern.
