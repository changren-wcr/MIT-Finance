1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,500
PROFESSOR: Next, we consider the concept of interest rate risk.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,780
And in particular, we will introduce the concept

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,710
of bond duration, which is a quantitative measure of risk

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,110
exposure of bonds.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,160
Now, bonds are fixed-income securities,

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,450
but they're not risk free.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,420
If you invest in a long-term bond and interest rates change,

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,700
the value of the bond will change accordingly.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,640
Movements in interest rates are uncertain.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,610
They're random.

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,000
And therefore, changes in bond prices or bonds returns

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,259
are also random.

13
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,930
They're risky.

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,410
Now, if you look at the graph here,

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,340
you could see how the bond price depends

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,590
on the yield of the bond.

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,690
The relation is negative.

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,330
As the yield on the bonds rises, the bond price falls.

19
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,910
This negative relation is going to tell us

20
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,720
how sensitive bond prices are to changes in yields

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,300
or in interest rates.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,675
As an example, suppose that the term structure is flat.

23
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:02,750
All spot interest rates are equal to y.

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,690
Let's say that at the yield of 5%,

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,990
the price of a particular bond is $90.

26
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,370
If yields suddenly move to 4%, the bond price rises.

27
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,820
Let's say, it rises to $91.80.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,190
The relative price change of the bond is 91.8 minus 90 over 90--

29
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,660
that's the bond's return--

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,780
equal to 2%.

31
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,030
If we normalize the return of the bond

32
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,790
by the change in the yield, the ratio

33
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,580
of 2% bond return to 1% change in the yield is 2.

34
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,380
In this case, we can think of this number

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,630
as a quantitative measure of risk.

36
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,820
It's a measure of sensitivity of the bond

37
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,870
price to changes in the yield.

38
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,240
Notice that we've changed the sign here.

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,550
The yield change is in fact minus 1%.

40
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,860
This is a common convention.

41
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,120
We want our risk measure to be positive,

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,960
so we're going to change the sign to achieve that.

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,460
Now more generally, we're going to measure risk of the bond

44
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,150
by looking at the infinitesimal changes in the yield

45
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,780
and how bond prices respond to said changes.

46
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,590
This is going to define a measure of bond risk.

47
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,250
Mathematically, we are going to measure bond risk using what

48
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,500
is called modified duration, which

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,060
is defined as the negative of the derivative of the bond

50
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,820
price with respect to the yield change,

51
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,680
normalized by the bond price itself.

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,270
In other words, this is the infinitesimal change

53
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,120
in the bond price in percentage terms divided

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,120
by the infinitesimal change in the level of interest

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,810
rates in the yields.

56
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,710
Now, consider as a special case a pure discount bond.

57
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,220
This is a t period bond, which trades at the price Bt.

58
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,030
That price is equal to 1 plus the yield raised

59
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,370
to power minus t.

60
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,360
If we substitute this bond price into the definition of modified

61
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,200
duration, we find that for the pure discount bond,

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,670
modified duration is equal to t, the maturity of the bond--

63
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,990
time to maturity--

64
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,080
divided by 1 plus the yield.

65
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,180
In other words, modified duration

66
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,190
of the bond and its time to maturity are closely linked.

67
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,010
For a pure discount bond, modified duration

68
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,420
times 1 plus the yield is equal to time to maturity.

69
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,490
This relation suggests that there

70
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,130
is a physical, intuitive interpretation

71
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,140
of bond duration.

72
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,050
It has a lot to do with the maturity structure of the cash

73
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,360
flows of the bond.

74
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,930
Next, we introduce a closely related concept,

75
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,510
Macauley duration, which makes it even more clear

76
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,380
that bond duration and maturity structure of its cash flows

77
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,640
are directly connected.

78
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,240
So consider a general stream of cash flows--

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,980
risk-free cash flows.

80
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,300
Call them CFt for period t.

81
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,300
We define Macauley duration as follows.

82
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,990
For each tenor t, we compute the present value

83
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,310
of the corresponding cash flow.

84
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,580
We normalize it by the total value of the cash flow, B.

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,670
And we use this as a weight.

86
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,240
And using these weights, we average the tenors from 1

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,390
to capital T.

88
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,980
According to this definition, each tenor t

89
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,010
contributes something to Macauley duration.

90
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,220
And it contributes more if the corresponding cash

91
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,350
flow is larger, if it accounts for a larger

92
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,482
fraction of the total price of the security.

93
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:39,940
Physically, you could think of this

94
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,350
as a definition of the center of gravity of the payment tenors.

95
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,960
As it turns out, Macauley duration

96
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,370
and the modified duration that we just defined

97
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,500
are directly related to each other.

98
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,580
And in fact, modified duration is Macauley duration

99
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,260
normalized by 1 plus the yield.

100
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,200
So what we see is that modified duration

101
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,600
is proportional to the weighted average of the payment tenors

102
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,380
where the weights are proportional

103
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,030
to the present value of the corresponding cash flows.

104
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,390
Indeed, the duration of the bond is directly

105
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,480
based on the term structure of its payments.

106
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,300
Next, consider an empirical example.

107
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,730
Instead of computing bond duration

108
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,400
based on the term structure of its payments,

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,520
we can estimate its duration by running

110
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,390
a regression of bond returns on changes in yields,

111
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,000
or changes in interest rates.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,690
We'll look at several examples.

113
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,770
We'll look at 5-year Treasuries, 10-year Treasuries,

114
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,040
and 30-year Treasuries.

115
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,110
As you can see from the first graph,

116
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,860
changes in the price of a 5-year Treasury bond returns

117
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,448
are closely linked to movements in interest rates.

118
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:52,240
There is a very strong statistical relation

119
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,500
between them.

120
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,370
And the slope coefficient is less than 5.

121
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,200
What this is telling us is that the factor

122
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,340
of duration of a 5-year treasury is less than 5.

123
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,100
And that is because these bonds pay coupons.

124
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,860
And as a result, the center of gravity of their payments

125
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,380
is somewhere between 0 and 5 years.

126
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,410
It's close to 5 years, because the bulk of the payments

127
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,320
comes at the maturity date of the bond.

128
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,810
We observe a similar picture for the 10-year

129
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,880
and the 30-year bond.

130
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,210
Again, bond returns are explained very well

131
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,820
by changes in the level of interest rates.

132
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,630
And the slope coefficient in these regressions

133
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,390
is closely related to the maturity structure of the bond

134
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,470
payment.

135
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,440
It is under 10 years for a 10-year bond.

136
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,110
And it's somewhere between 0 and 30 years for a 30-year bond.
