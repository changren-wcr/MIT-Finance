1
00:00:00,712 --> 00:00:03,520
PROFESSOR: We now consider a more general bond valuation

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,510
problem.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,990
Previously, we started with prices of pure discount bonds.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,530
And we figured out how to value a coupon bond.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,540
Now, we are looking at the generic situation

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,400
where we start with prices of different types of bonds.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,650
Some are discount bonds.

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,450
Some are coupon paying bonds.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,770
And we want to answer two questions.

10
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,730
One is what are the implied interest rates?

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,730
What are the prices of discount bonds?

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,040
And the second question is if you observe

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,170
an instance of mispricing--

14
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,785
if some of the prices are inconsistent with each other--

15
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,160
how can you take advantage of it?

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,380
How can you build an arbitrage trading strategy?

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,540
So to be specific, we have three bonds

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,630
to start with, A, B, and C. A is a one-year discount bond

19
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,520
paying $100 at time 1.

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,470
B is a two-year coupon bond paying a 5% annual coupon.

21
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,630
And C is a three-year coupon bond

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,630
paying a 10% annual coupon.

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,640
And the prices of these bonds are given in the table.

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,600
A trades at $96 at time 0.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,640
B trades at $99.30.

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,140
And bond C trades at $108.80.

27
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,830
We are also given bond D, which is a three-year discount

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,470
bond with a face value of $100.

29
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,690
And D trades at $84.

30
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,830
The question is, is this bond fairly priced?

31
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,678
And if it is not, how can we take advantage of mispricing?

32
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:35,930
So to start with, we are going to collect

33
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,880
given information in a matrix.

34
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,190
It's a matrix of bond payoffs.

35
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,840
And you could see that each of the rows

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,100
corresponds to one of the bonds, A, B, and C.

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,230
And for each of the bonds, we are tabulating their cash

38
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,190
flows.

39
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,480
Bond A pays $100 at time 1 and 0 afterwards.

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,840
Bond B pays $5 at time 1, $105 at time 2, and 0 afterwards.

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,020
And bond C pays $10, $10, and $110 at time 3.

42
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,229
Now, we are trying to find prices of discount bonds

43
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,070
of maturities 1, 2, and 3 years.

44
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,580
Let's call them P1, P2, and P3.

45
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,130
Each of these bonds has a face value of $1.

46
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,370
Let's relate prices of these bonds to the given bonds.

47
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,980
For example, focus on bond B. This bond

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,880
is equivalent to a portfolio of discount bonds--

49
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,120
five units of a one-year bond and 105 units

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,250
of a two-year discount bond.

51
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,950
So we obtain a pricing equation.

52
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:49,940
5 times P1 plus 105 times P2 plus 0 times P3 is equal

53
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,710
to $99.30.

54
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:59,600
We can obtain a similar pricing equation for bonds A and C.

55
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,360
As a result, we have a system of equations,

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,970
three equations, each one corresponding

57
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,490
to a price of a single bond.

58
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,460
And we have three unknowns, each one corresponding

59
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,050
to a price of a discount bond, 1, 2, and 3.

60
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,900
This system of equations has a unique solution,

61
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,400
which you can compute.

62
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,910
And what we find is that P1, the price of a one-year discount

63
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,930
bond, is $0.96 cents.

64
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,350
P2 is $0.90.

65
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,170
And P3 is $0.82.

66
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,000
What we have done is we recovered

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,830
prices of discount bonds.

68
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,770
Or in other words, we recovered the spot interest rates

69
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,380
from the collection of prices of various fixed income

70
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,720
securities, different types of bonds--

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,600
coupon bonds and discount bonds.

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,970
Now, looking at our solution, we can

73
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,120
see that the price of the bond D is not

74
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,700
consistent with the prices of A, B, and C. D trades at $84,

75
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,370
but the implied price for a three-year discount bond

76
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,750
is $82.

77
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,650
So D is not fairly priced relative to A, B, and C.

78
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,910
How can we take advantage of this situation?

79
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,890
We are going to build an arbitrage strategy.

80
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,230
Let's recall that an arbitrage strategy is

81
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,360
supposed to be self-financing.

82
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,529
It does not require any infusion of capital.

83
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,420
It's supposed to be risk free.

84
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,459
There is no risk of losing money.

85
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,460
And it's supposed to be profitable.

86
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,870
There should be a positive probability of generating

87
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,370
a positive cash flow.

88
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,120
So we're going to construct a portfolio of bonds A,

89
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,890
B, C, and D to generate arbitrage profits.

90
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:42,460
Let's call our positions xA, xB, xC, and xD respectively.

91
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,070
And x refers to the number of shares

92
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,030
of each of these securities in our portfolio.

93
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,120
Our objective is going to be to generate

94
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,470
a cash flow of $1 at time 0 and nothing in periods 1, 2, and 3.

95
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,230
Of course, this is arbitrage.

96
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,490
There is no risk of a loss.

97
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,790
And we get $1 for free at time 0.

98
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,810
That's the free lunch arbitrage.

99
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,990
Now, this requirement can be expressed

100
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,810
as a system of four equations.

101
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,930
Each equation corresponds to the cash flow

102
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,290
coming out of the portfolio in a given period.

103
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,830
The first row corresponds to time 0; second, time 1;

104
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,460
2; and 3 respectively.

105
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,260
So now, for the first period, we want

106
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,510
to generate a cash flow of $1.

107
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,080
The cash flow that the portfolio produces

108
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,406
can be computed as a function of the portfolio positions, xA,

109
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:40,775
xB, xC, and xD.

110
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,900
In particular, when you buy a security-- let's say,

111
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,730
you're buying bond A--

112
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,070
you are generating a negative cash flow

113
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,020
for each share you buy.

114
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,600
The negative cash flow is equal to the negative of the price

115
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,050
of the bond at time 0.

116
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,140
At time 1, you generate a positive cash flow, $100,

117
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,910
which corresponds to the payoff of the bond.

118
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,980
And then because the bond expires at time 1,

119
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,950
it pays nothing in periods 2 and 3.

120
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,220
So looking at time 0, the cash flow of the portfolio

121
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,030
is going to be minus $96 times xA--

122
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,760
that's the contribution of bond A--

123
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,190
minus $99.3, which is the price of bond B,

124
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,990
times xB, and so forth.

125
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,870
So we're summing, across all four bonds,

126
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,840
the size of the position times the negative of the bond price.

127
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,320
The combined cash flow at time 0 is supposed to be $1.

128
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,760
That's the requirement for our arbitrage strategy.

129
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,150
At time 1, we want the strategy to pay off 0.

130
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,410
So the cash flow of bond A times the number of shares,

131
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,700
which is 100 times xA, plus the cash flow of bond B,

132
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,570
which is 5 times the number of shares-- times xB--

133
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,830
plus 10 times xC-- that's contribution of bond C--

134
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,940
plus 0 times xD, because bond D does not

135
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,820
pay anything at time 1.

136
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,950
That sum has to be equal to 0.

137
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,780
And so we obtain the same kind of equation

138
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,490
for time 2 and time 3.

139
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,040
We have four equations and four unknowns.

140
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,700
The unknowns are the positions in the portfolio for bonds A,

141
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,210
B, C, and D. The system of equations

142
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,660
has a unique solution, which we find.

143
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,000
What we see is that we can indeed

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,470
generate arbitrage profits.

145
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,100
We knew that because prices were internally inconsistent.

146
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,740
And to do that, we have to take a short position in bond A

147
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,390
and in bond B. The size of the position

148
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,270
is minus 0.0433 shares.

149
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:43,620
We take a long position in bond C. The size is 0.4545 shares.

150
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,190
And we short half a share of bond D. The strategy

151
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,340
has no risk of a loss and generates a single dollar

152
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,360
of profit at time 0.

153
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,210
In conclusion, what this example illustrates

154
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,860
is that when you observe a rich set of fixed-income securities,

155
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,000
you can infer prices of various other assets.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,580
You can price securities relative to each other.

157
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,950
There are strong arbitrage-based restrictions

158
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,520
on the relative prices of assets in fixed-income markets.

159
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,950
In particular, prices of coupon bonds

160
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,890
can be used to infer prices of discount bonds,

161
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,810
or in other words, spot interest rates.

162
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,840
We can therefore recover the yield curve

163
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,510
from the prices of coupon bonds.

164
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,090
So far, we looked at arbitrage restrictions

165
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,390
in a static framework.

166
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,700
Our trading strategy was one short trade at time 0.

167
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,299
We generated arbitrage profits.

168
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,030
These arbitrage-based methods are more general than that.

169
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,550
And they can be used in a dynamic setting that

170
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,860
can be applied over time.

171
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,570
To do that, we need to build models

172
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,700
which are dynamic, that incorporate trading

173
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,350
over multiple periods.

174
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,730
And this is a subject for future lectures.
