1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,550
PROFESSOR: Next, we talk about relative valuation

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,030
of coupon bonds in relation to pure discount bonds,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,280
or zero coupon bonds.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,020
First, let's consider the relation

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,130
between interest rates and bond prices for pure discount bonds.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,610
This is a matter of definition.

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,720
Interest rates can express the rate of return on the bond.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,610
Bond prices also explains the rate of return,

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,520
but in different terms.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,890
Bond prices and interest rates are directly related

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,370
to each other.

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,990
The relation is that the bond price with a face value

13
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,850
of $1.00 and maturity t is equal to 1 divided by 1 plus

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,590
the interest rate to the power t.

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,320
In other words, the price of the bond today

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,530
is equal to the face value of the bond discounted

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,530
at the rate of interest from now until the maturity

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,050
date of the bond.

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,720
If we are thinking of interest rates

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,700
as the primary source of data, we

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,760
can then express bond prices as a function of the interest

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,470
rates.

23
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,540
Alternatively, if bond prices are

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,100
observed as the primary input, we

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,595
can express interest rates as a function of the bond prices.

26
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:09,250


27
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,880
A coupon bond pays a regular stream

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,640
of coupon payments in addition to the principal payment

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,260
at maturity.

30
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,120
We're going to think of a coupon bond

31
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,750
as a portfolio of pure discount bonds,

32
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,680
where each of the payments delivered by the coupon bond

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,520
can be visualized as a payoff over a single discount bond

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,220
with the corresponding maturity.

35
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,300
We are going to use low bond price, or arbitrage valuation,

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,630
to establish a connection between the price of a coupon

37
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,920
bond and prices of discount bonds of various maturities.

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,540
We can also go in reverse.

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,060
We can start with the prices of coupon bonds

40
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,840
and recover implied values of discount bonds.

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,612
Let's consider an example.

42
00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:56,320
Suppose we are working with a 3-year year

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,640
bond with a $1,000 principal payment and a 5% coupon.

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,180
So in the first year, the holder of the bonds

45
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,650
receives a payment of $50; second year, $50;

46
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:13,570
the third year, it's $1,000 and the $50 coupon payment.

47
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,330
We can think of this bond as a sequence of cash flows

48
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,840
that can be replicated by a portfolio of discount bonds.

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,050
In this case, we need three discount bonds.

50
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,320
We need the bond with maturity of 1,

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,160
the bond that pays off at time 1, paying $50 at the time.

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,430
We the bond that matures at time 2, also paying 50.

53
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,740
And we need a discount bond that pays $1,050 at time 3.

54
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,900
Our coupon bond is equivalent to the portfolio of zero coupon

55
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,980
bonds.

56
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,550
As a result, the price of the coupon bond

57
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,520
has to be equal to the cost of the portfolio of zero coupon

58
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,640
bonds according to the Law of One Price.

59
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,750
If that equality was violated, then there would be arbitrage.

60
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,810
For example, if the price of the coupon bond

61
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,900
were to be lower than the price of the portfolio of zero coupon

62
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,210
bonds that replicate its cash flows,

63
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,790
an investor could buy a coupon bond

64
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,300
and short sell the replicating portfolio of pure discount

65
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,210
bonds to lock in arbitrage profits.

66
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,300
We can generalize this argument to any coupon paying bond.

67
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,540
Of course, there was nothing special about our 3-year bond.

68
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,340
And we arrive at the general formula

69
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,190
that tells us that the price of a coupon bond

70
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,690
is equal to a sum across the dates from one

71
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,270
to the maturity date of the bond, capital T,

72
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,690
of the coupon payment of the bond times the price

73
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,770
of the corresponding discount bond plus the principal payment

74
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,730
to be multiplied by the price of the pure discount bond paying

75
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,930
off at time capital T. This is the formula that we see.

76
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,140
The price of the bond is equal to the discounted value

77
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,020
of its cash flows, where we are discounting them

78
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,720
at the corresponding interest rate.

79
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,680
As an example, suppose that the yield curve is given

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,180
by the following information.

81
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,060
The discount bond with maturity of 1 trades at 95.2 cents with

82
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,029
a face value of $1.00.

83
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:21,130
The discount rate with maturity 2 trades at 89.8 cents.

84
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,540
The discount bond of maturity 3 trades at 86.3 cents,

85
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,500
and so on.

86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,170
We do not need to know the prices of other bonds.

87
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,690
For exercise, now we are pricing the 3-year bond

88
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,690
that we have seen, the price of this bond

89
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,190
comes out to be $998.65, which is

90
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,900
50 times the price of a 1-year bond, which is 95.2 cents,

91
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,530
plus $50 times the price of a 2-year bond, which

92
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:54,160
is 89.8 cents, plus $1,050 times the price of a 3-year discount

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,170
bond, which is 86.3.

94
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,740
This is a special case of the general formula bond.
