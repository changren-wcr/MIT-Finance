1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,550
PROFESSOR: Next, we're going to discuss

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,640
some of the properties of yield curve dynamics

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,010
and the models that describe how interest

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,400
rates of various maturities are related to each other.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,340
Let's start with the expectations hypothesis,

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,120
which is an important theory about properties

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,620
of interest rates.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,160
It is an important benchmark.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,620
To introduce this idea, let's consider

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,860
two alternative investment strategies.

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,780
Strategy one is very simple.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:37,230
We start with $1 and invest it into a 10-year discount bond.

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,700
Strategy two, invest the same dollar into a 9-year discount

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,730
bond, and then reinvest the proceeds

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,130
of that first investment over an additional 1-year period.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,940
Of course, we reinvest it at the 1-year spot rate at that time,

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,180
between years 9 and 10.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,860
Under the expectations hypothesis,

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,850
we assume that bonds do not carry a risk premium, which

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,630
means that all of these types of investment strategies

21
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,620
that move money between time 0 and time 10

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,100
by investing in different bonds and maybe reinvesting-- they

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,050
all earn the same expected rate of return.

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,320
In other words, under the expectations hypothesis,

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,960
the expected return on strategy two

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,130
has to be equal to the expected return on strategy one.

27
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,440
Let's explore the implication of this idea.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,230
First, introduce a new piece of notation.

29
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,160
r sub s as a function of t is going

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:50,620
to denote the spot interest rate at time t with a maturity s.

31
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,130
By default, we're going to set t equal to 0.

32
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,790
So we're talking about interest rates at time 0.

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,170
Consider our two strategies-- strategy one, strategy two.

34
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,009
In the formula, the total return of strategy one

35
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,259
appears on the right-hand side.

36
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,110
It is equal to 1 plus the 10-year spot

37
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,440
rate raised to power 10.

38
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,880
The expected return on strategy two is on the left-hand side.

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,530
Notice that the realized return of strategy two is 1 plus

40
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,480
the 9-year spot rate as of time 0 raised to power 9--

41
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,300
that's the return on the first leg of the strategy

42
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,540
and the investment in that 9-year discount bond--

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,310
times 1 plus the 1-year spot rate as of time 9.

44
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,800
This is the second leg of the strategy.

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,250
And note that there is a squiggle-- the tilde-- on top

46
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,380
of that interest rate, which reminds us

47
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,680
that the spot rate at time 9 is a random variable.

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
It is not known as of time 0.

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,990
The expectations hypothesis equates the expected value

50
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,700
of the left-hand side and the right-hand side.

51
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,830
Of course, the right-hand side is not random.

52
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,420
We know exactly what the spot rate for a 10-year investment

53
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,040
is as of time 0.

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,770
It's a 10-year spot interest rate.

55
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,030
Now, if we rearrange the terms in this equation,

56
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,050
we can relate the expected value of a 1-year spot rate at time 9

57
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:31,020
to the spot rate at time 0 for maturities of 9 and 10.

58
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,400
This equation tells us that the expected value of a 9-year spot

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,680
rate is equal to the ratio of 1 plus the 10-year rate raised

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,610
to power 10 divided by 1 plus the 9-year spot

61
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,726
rate raised to power 9 minus 1.

62
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,080
Under the expectations hypothesis,

63
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,000
the slope of the yield curve predicts future spot rates.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,870
To see what that means, let's consider our formula closely.

65
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,760
Expected value of a 1-year spot rate at time 9

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,470
can be expressed as the ratio of 1 plus the 10-year spot rate

67
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,090
to power 9 divided by 1 plus the 9-year spot rate to power 9

68
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:20,984
times 1 plus the 10-year spot rate minus 1.

69
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:23,110
Suppose that the 10-year spot rate

70
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,620
is above the 9-year rate as of time 0.

71
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,570
In other words, the yield curve is upward

72
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,260
sloping between years 9 and 10.

73
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,360
With that information, we can see

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,400
that the first term in the formula

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,660
is going to be at least as high as 1 plus the 10-year spot

76
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,500
rate.

77
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,280
And so as a result, the expected interest rate

78
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,250
over a single year at time 9 has to be higher

79
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,190
than the 10-year spot rate at time 0.

80
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,900
In other words, when the yield curve is upward sloping,

81
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,970
it's telling us that the expected spot

82
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,560
rate in the future has to be relatively high.

83
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,880
If the yield curve was downward sloping,

84
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,450
we would find the reverse, that the expected spot rate

85
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,510
at time 9 is relatively low.

86
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,870
Now, in a special case when the 10-year rate

87
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,330
is equal to the 9-year rate, using the formula,

88
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,440
we can see that the expected value of a 1-year spot

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,150
rate at time 9 is equal to the 10-year or the 9-year spot

90
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,240
rates at time 0.

91
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,240
More generally, the expectations hypothesis

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,660
tells us there is a relation between expected future spot

93
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,310
rates and the current spot rates.

94
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,830
This is a direct generalization of the equation

95
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,650
that we derived in our example.

96
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,440
The expected 1-year rate at time t

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,780
is related to the spot rates for periods t and t plus 1.

98
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,610
Specifically, it's the ratio of 1

99
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,210
plus the spot rate for period t plus 1 raised to power t

100
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,680
plus 1 divided by 1 plus the t period spot

101
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,122
rate raised to power t minus 1.

102
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:09,690
Under the expectations hypothesis,

103
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,630
the expected value of the future interest rates

104
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,170
is based on the current interest rates.

105
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,140
As an alternative to the expectations hypothesis,

106
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,400
consider the following so-called liquidity hypothesis.

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,780
Under this idea, investors regard long-term bonds

108
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,260
as relatively risky relative to short-term bonds.

109
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,940
For example, if you are an investor with a relatively

110
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,000
short horizon, and you buy a long-term bond,

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,980
at the end of your investment period

112
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,650
when you liquidate your position, the payoff is random.

113
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,420
It depends on the future interest rates.

114
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,330
In contrast, if you invest into a short-term bond,

115
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,360
your payoff could be relatively less risky or even fixed.

116
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,030
That's one of the arguments that could be used to justify

117
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,050
the liquidity preference.

118
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,680
More generally, under the liquidity preference

119
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,640
hypothesis, the equation that we derived for the expectations

120
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,920
hypothesis needs to be modified.

121
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,020
The right-hand side is the same.

122
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,290
It relates spot rates of different maturities.

123
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,240
On the left-hand side, what we see

124
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,660
is that in addition to the expected future spot rate,

125
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,390
we have an additional term, lambda,

126
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,810
which represents the so-called risk premium or a liquidity

127
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,110
premium.

128
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,110
In other words, the slope of the yield curve over various points

129
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,410
down the curve between time t and t plus 1

130
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,850
represents not only the expected future spot rate, but also

131
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,660
an adjustment that accounts for riskiness

132
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,610
of bonds of long maturities.

133
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,490
The implication of this hypothesis

134
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:55,270
is that if lambda is positive, than the long bonds on average

135
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,530
receive a higher rate of return than the short-term bonds.

136
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,240
In other words, if you're thinking

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,330
about predicting interest rates using the shape of the yield

138
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,720
curve, this tells us that the spot interest

139
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,720
rates of long maturities overpredict

140
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,250
the future short-term rates.

141
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,150
So if you use the expectations hypothesis formula,

142
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,950
and you form a forecast of the spot rate using that relation,

143
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,050
that forecast is going to be biased.

144
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,090
It's going to be upward biased.

145
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,790
And the reason for that is that the slope of the yield

146
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,049
curve between various points is not equal to the expected spot

147
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:39,080
rate, but also accounts for a liquidity or a risk premium.

148
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,789
Historically, long-term bonds produced higher average rates

149
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,690
of return than short-term bonds.

150
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,790
For instance, if you look at the period from 1926 until 2018,

151
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,340
the average rate of return on short-term Treasury

152
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,870
bonds in the US, the Treasury bills, has been 3.4%.

153
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,610
In comparison, long-term bonds earned 5.9%.

154
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,870
This highlights the fact that, on average, long-term bonds

155
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,120
produce a higher rate of return than short-term bonds.

156
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,610
This empirical fact tells us that the expectations

157
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,080
hypothesis does not describe market dynamics very well.

158
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,030
Under the expectations hypothesis,

159
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,670
average rates of return on long-term bonds

160
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,010
and on short-term bonds would have to be the same.

161
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,770
Empirically, they're quite different.

162
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,900
So why do long-term bonds earn a higher rate of return?

163
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,460
Why is there a positive spread or the positive risk premium

164
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,430
attached to the long-term bonds?

165
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,440
There could be several potential reasons for that.

166
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,140
One reason is that short-term bonds are in a way money-like.

167
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,450
They are relatively liquid.

168
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,000
They hold their value better in the short run

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,470
than long-term bonds.

170
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,460
If investors have needs for these types of securities that

171
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,280
are relatively safe over short horizons,

172
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,180
then they will be willing to pay more for short-term bonds.

173
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,610
In other words, they will be willing to accept lower

174
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,550
rates of return on these bonds.

175
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,760
The rate of return on cash, on money, is 0.

176
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,310
And short-term bonds, which are money-like,

177
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,700
accordingly would have to have lower rates of return.

178
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,850
That's one argument.

179
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,100
Another reason for why long-term bonds

180
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,190
may pay higher rates of return than short-term bonds

181
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,460
is because they are more exposed to inflation risk.

182
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,260
We're talking about nominal bonds here.

183
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,560
They lose value when inflation spikes.

184
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,010
Suppose there is news that inflation in the future

185
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,000
is going to be higher.

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,720
This news is going to reduce the value of long-term bonds

187
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,760
and is going to raise future interest rates.

188
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,510
Short-term bonds are relatively immune to these types

189
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,120
of shocks.

190
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,310
As a result, inflation risk is going

191
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,110
to affect long-term bond investors

192
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,740
more than those invested in short-term securities.

193
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,920
This could be one reason why investors in long-term bonds

194
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,080
would demand a higher rate of return

195
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,870
to compensate them for inflation risk.

196
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,580
We have seen a couple of theories

197
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,340
that talk about various determinants of yields

198
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,340
or interest rates across maturities.

199
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,960
Expectations of future spot rates, of course,

200
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,680
affect interest rates of various maturities.

201
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,790
But that is not the whole story.

202
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,150
Risk of long-term bonds is also important.

203
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,480
So expectations of future rates and their risk

204
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,500
ultimately determine the shape of the yield curve.

205
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,940
Expectations hypothesis assumes that there is no risk premium,

206
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,370
that interest rates across maturities

207
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,550
are based on the expected future spot rates.

208
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,110
The liquidity preference hypothesis

209
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,820
incorporates considerations of risk.

210
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,350
But it is not very specific about how, exactly, risk

211
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,760
affects spot rates across the yield curve.

212
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,530
There are more explicit, dynamic theories of the term structure

213
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,380
that develop mathematical models of how

214
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,220
interest rates across maturities evolve across time

215
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,480
and how their behavior is shaped by expectations

216
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,580
of future rates and their risk.

217
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,010
Examples of these are the Vasicek model,

218
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,980
the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model, and so forth.

219
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,880
You can learn more about these dynamic models of the yield

curve in the fixed income course.
