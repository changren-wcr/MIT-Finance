1
00:00:01,157 --> 00:00:02,740
PROFESSOR: In this class, we will talk

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,410
about fixed income securities--

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,260
the properties, the markets where they trade,

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,780
and some of the important elements

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,330
of analytics of dealing with fixed income assets, how

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,890
we price them.

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,440
Let's begin with a general overview of fixed income

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,270
markets and securities.

9
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,900
A fixed income security is a financial claim

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,880
with promised cash flows of fixed amount and fixed dates.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,850
When we use the term fixed income, this refers to the fact

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,580
that these securities are explicit about which cash

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,640
flows are promised and when.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,720
This does not mean that they are risk free.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,890
Obviously, there could be circumstances

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,880
when these securities do not deliver the promised cash

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,600
flows.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,050
There are various types of fixed income securities traded

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,320
in the markets, and these form an important part

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,120
of capital markets.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,090
We are going to mention just several of the major classes

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,530
of fixed income securities.

23
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,440
At the top of our list are treasuries.

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,930
These are government bonds issued

25
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,320
by various governments, US treasuries, Japanese government

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,240
bonds, German bonds.

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,630
These are used by governments to conduct their fiscal policy.

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,730
In the United States, we also have

29
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,420
debt of fixed income assets issued by the federal sponsored

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,630
agencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,760
And these are the agencies that support

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,930
the functions of the housing market,

33
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,810
and they are important players in the fixed income markets.

34
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,980
Municipal bonds are a little bit different from treasuries

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,780
because of their tax treatment.

36
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,790
Municipal bonds in the United States

37
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,070
are exempt from the federal tax.

38
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,810
And for the local investors, they

39
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,140
are also exempt from the local state taxes.

40
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,680
Corporate bonds are also an important and large part

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,730
of the fixed income market.

42
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,660
They come in various forms and shapes.

43
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,650
They differ across maturities and various properties

44
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,280
of securities that we are going to discuss a little bit later.

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,770
Corporate bonds are issued by firms

46
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,640
and are used to finance a variety of business activities.

47
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,690
Finally, we should mention mortgage-backed and

48
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,660
asset-backed securities, which are created

49
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,690
using financial engineering using the process called

50
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,250
securitization.

51
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,540
And these assets are based on an underlying pool of other more

52
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,260
primitive assets, such as mortgages, car loans, student

53
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,700
loans, and so forth.

54
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,920
The following pie chart gives us a snapshot of the bond markets

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,790
in the United States in 2019.

56
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,980
As you can see here, there are three large segments

57
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,420
of the market that capture most of the market value

58
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,430
across fixed income securities.

59
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,950
First, the treasuries.

60
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,810
Treasuries account for roughly a third

61
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,560
of the fixed income market.

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,440
These are bonds issued by the US government.

63
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,670
Second, mortgage-related securities.

64
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,690
These are at a lower level than the treasury market,

65
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,310
but they capture roughly a quarter

66
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,390
of the fixed income market.

67
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,560
These are securities that are backed by pools of mortgages.

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,550
We also see that the corporate debt market is roughly

69
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,300
of the same size as the mortgage-related securities

70
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,010
and accounts for roughly a quarter

71
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,650
of the fixed income market.

72
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,900
We have several smaller segments,

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,010
such as debt securities issued by federal agencies--

74
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,720
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.

75
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,650
These are at roughly 4% of the total market.

76
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,220
Asset-backed securities-- these are

77
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,250
securities that are backed by pools

78
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,820
of financial assets other than mortgages-- car loans, student

79
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,690
loans.

80
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,720
These are at around 4% of the total market.

81
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,508
And the municipal market is about 8% of the total.

82
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,050
And finally, the money markets, which

83
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,480
are very short maturity securities, that

84
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,310
stands at around 2% of the total market.

85
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,450
What we can see from this graph is that fixed income markets

86
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,470
are fairly heterogeneous.

87
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,332
There are several large segments.

88
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:19,790
And in our discussion, we are going

89
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,000
to focus on some of these in particular.

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,960
In today's lecture, our primary focus

91
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,702
is going to be on the valuation of treasuries.

92
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:28,160
And in the following classes, we're

93
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,820
going to talk about pricing of corporate bonds.

94
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,520
Next, let's consider participants

95
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,440
in the fixed income markets.

96
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,450
It is convenient to think in terms

97
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,280
of three broad categories--

98
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,670
the issuers, the intermediaries, and the investors.

99
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,730
This division is not exact, and some

100
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,610
of the players in these markets play multiple roles

101
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,520
and show up in different categories.

102
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,900
Issuers in these markets are those entities that

103
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,460
issue fixed income securities.

104
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,520
These are the borrowers in fixed income markets.

105
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,220
Governments are important players

106
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,240
in fixed income markets.

107
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,270
They issue treasuries, government bonds.

108
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,170
Municipalities are the source of municipal securities

109
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,570
and corporations, who issue corporate bonds.

110
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,040
There are various intermediaries present in these markets that

111
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,930
facilitate primary transactions, which is when a borrower issues

112
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,660
the bond for the first time, as well as secondary market

113
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,800
transactions.

114
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,350
This is when the bonds change hands

115
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,110
and are traded among investors.

116
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,060
We are going to highlight only a few

117
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,900
of the intermediaries that are important.

118
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,540
We have various kinds of dealers in these markets.

119
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,770
We have primary dealers and other dealers.

120
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,380
Primary dealers play a special role in the sense

121
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,010
that they participate in the auctions of government

122
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,400
securities.

123
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,220
So they are the first ones to absorb

124
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,680
the supply of government bonds.

125
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,200
Other dealers facilitate transactions

126
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,650
in the secondary market among investors.

127
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,530
For example, a treasury starts its life

128
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,830
by being issued by the US government.

129
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,440
It gets sold to a primary dealer,

130
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,690
which could be a large bank.

131
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,110
And then it eventually gets sold in the secondary market

132
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,160
to other investors.

133
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,400
A bond can, of course, change hands multiple times

134
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,670
throughout its life by being traded in the secondary market.

135
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,100
Investment banks play an important role

136
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,100
as intermediaries in the fixed income markets.

137
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,170
They serve multiple functions.

138
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,710
They can act as a dealer holding an inventory of bonds.

139
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,460
They can act as a broker making matches

140
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,050
between buyers and sellers of fixed income securities.

141
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,050
And they can also help corporations or municipalities

142
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,460
issue their bonds.

143
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,900
So they can help in the primary transactions.

144
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,780
They can help structure bonds and place them with investors.

145
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,320
An important class of players in fixed income markets

146
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,790
are credit rating agencies.

147
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,280
This is a somewhat unique feature.

148
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,370
We do not see this kind of entity in the equity markets.

149
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,870
They are specific to the fixed income markets.

150
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,020
As the name suggests, credit rating agencies,

151
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,460
such as S&P or Moody's, serve to provide information

152
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,160
about the quality of fixed income securities.

153
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,410
They rate credit quality.

154
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,110
They attach credit rating to different securities

155
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,260
that indicates the relative riskiness.

156
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,230
This information can be then used by the investors

157
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,540
to decide on how to allocate their capital

158
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,000
across different types of assets.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,020
We're going to look more closely at ratings of bonds

160
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,270
and how they map into their risk when

161
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,340
we discuss risky corporate bonds in the following classes.

162
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,220
There are multiple types of investors in the fixed income

163
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,690
markets.

164
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,430
Pension funds, insurance companies

165
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,580
are big holders of bonds.

166
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,560
In particular, insurance companies

167
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,020
hold large quantities of corporate bonds

168
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,010
and pension funds also hold a significant amount

169
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,270
of treasuries and corporate bonds of various maturities.

170
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,200
Mutual funds hold portfolios of fixed income securities,

171
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,350
and they can be viewed as one example of an entity which

172
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,213
is both an investor and an intermediary in this market.

173
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:24,630
If you think about the mutual fund

174
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,060
as a holder of corporate bonds, then of course

175
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,950
it acts as an investor.

176
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,190
At the same time, mutual funds serve an important function

177
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,760
of enabling individual investors to deploy

178
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,820
their capital invested in a diversified portfolio

179
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,200
of securities.

180
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,310
And in that capacity, mutual funds serve as intermediaries.

181
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,500
They connect individual investors

182
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,050
to the broad fixed income market.

183
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,530
Hedge funds are also players in multiple capital markets,

184
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,520
including in fixed income markets.

185
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,660
We think of hedge funds as investors in these securities.

186
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,610
They, of course, are also intermediaries

187
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,000
because hedge funds ultimately operate with capital that they

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,690
receive from their investors.

189
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,330
Banks and individuals are also buyers

190
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,140
of fixed income securities.
