1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,550
PROFESSOR: Bond duration can be used as a measure of bond risk.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,660
Now, let's take a closer look at how well

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,058
bond duration approximates the risk of the bond.

4
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:12,350
Consider the following example.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,250
We have a four-year treasury note with a face value of 100

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,240
and a 7% coupon, which is paid semiannually.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,620
So every six month, this bond pays $3.50 in coupons.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,920
In the following table, you can see the cash flows of the bond.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,590
It's 3.50 every six month.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,160
And the payment of $103.5 at the maturity date.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,940
Now, for this bond we can compute the Macaulay duration

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,700
as a weighted average of the payment tenors.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,780
And that happens to be equal to 7.13 periods.

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,530
Each period is half a year.

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,880
So this is a little less than four years.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,180
And the modified duration, which is Macaulay duration divided

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,800
by bond plus the yield on the bond, 1 plus 3%,

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,320
is equal to 6.92 periods.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,410
So it's a little bit shorter than three and 1/2 years.

20
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,730
Based on this number, based on the modified duration,

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,220
our infinitesimal formula can be used to approximate risk

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,260
exposure of the bond.

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,680
The formula tells us that when the semiannual yield moves

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:25,960
by 0.1%, the bond price should decrease by roughly 0.692%.

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,550
The approximate change in the bond in percentage terms

26
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,800
should be equal to the modified duration

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,960
times the change in the yield.

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,250
Now, this approximation is based on the infinitesimal analysis.

29
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,340
It's based on the Taylor approximation, Taylor expansion

30
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,170
of changes in the bond price.

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,560
What happens if yields move by a larger amount?

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,380
Is this formula going to remain accurate?

33
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,030
Let's do an experiment.

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,700
We're going to change yields by large amounts,

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,970
and see how the bond price responds.

36
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,500
In the following table, you could

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,130
see the price of our bond exactly computed

38
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,340
as a function of several different values of the bond

39
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,390
yield.

40
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,830
In the middle of the table, we see

41
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,270
that when the bond yield in semiannual terms is 3%,

42
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,440
the price of the bond is 103.5.

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,490
Now, we can compute bond price for different yield levels

44
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,480
exactly, or we can compute it approximately based

45
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,540
on the modified duration number.

46
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,630
What we see here is that when yields change by 10 basis

47
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,580
points from 3% to 3.1, the exact bond price

48
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,850
moves from 103.5 to $102.79.

49
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,080
And the duration based formula is producing a highly accurate

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,920
approximation.

51
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,080
It's giving us basically the same number.

52
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,240
So the difference shows up in higher order digits

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,510
past the decimal point.

54
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,900
Now, let's assume that the yield changes by a large amount.

55
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,320
It goes from 3% to 4%.

56
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,850
Now, the price of the bond drops to $96.63.

57
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,100
That's the exact bond price.

58
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,730
And the approximation based on modified duration

59
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,150
is giving us $96.35.

60
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,520
Now, we can see that there is a difference.

61
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,600
The duration-based formula is under-predicting the bond

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,240
price.

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,310
The exact price is higher than what we get

64
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,590
based on the duration formula.

65
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,420
This is not surprising.

66
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,660
The modified duration is a first order approximation

67
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,760
the price changes of the bond.

68
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,820
But the exact relation within the bond price and the yield

69
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,140
is nonlinear.

70
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,110
Therefore, when changes in the bond price are large,

71
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,620
we need to think of higher order approximations.

72
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,040
We can see this annotation clearly in the following graph.

73
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,410
The red line here corresponds to the exact price of the bond

74
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,760
as a function of the yield.

75
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,910
The blue line is a linear approximation.

76
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,870
It's giving us a very accurate description of the bond price

77
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,390
if changes in the yield are small.

78
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,770
But it kind of falls short when changes in the yield are large.

79
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,260
This blue line corresponds to the duration-based

80
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,670
approximation.

81
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,579
Our duration number is given as the slope

82
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,490
in the relation between the bond price and the yield.

83
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,560
If we want to account for the nonlinearity,

84
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,350
if you want to capture the most important nonlinear

85
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,560
term, the curvature of this curve,

86
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
we need to introduce higher order charts.

87
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,970
So curvature or convexity of this curve

88
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,500
need to be captured by an additional term.

89
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,920
And that term is called the convexity term.

90
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,060
Algebraically, what we can do is expand the bond price

91
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,030
in a Taylor series as a function of changes in the bond yield.

92
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,330
The leading term, which is a derivative

93
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,310
of the bond with respect to the yield times the change

94
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,860
in the yield, the first order term,

95
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,690
is captured by the modified duration.

96
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,440
Modified duration is the negative of this derivative

97
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,510
of the bond price with respect to the yield.

98
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,700
The second order term in the Taylor expansion,

99
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,430
the quadratic term, is what we call bond convexity.

100
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,140
So from the Taylor expansion, we can

101
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,050
see that the natural definition for bond convexity

102
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,370
is one half of the second derivative of the bond price

103
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,580
with respect to the yield divided by the bond price

104
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,030
itself.

105
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,970
The second order term is going to give us

106
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,970
an additional degree of approximation that

107
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,350
goes beyond the leading term, the duration-based term.

108
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,810
Let's see how much the convexity term

109
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,350
helps when the approximate bond price changes

110
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,200
under large movements in the yield curve.

111
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,070
Suppose we are looking at a 10-year bond with a 10% coupon

112
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,750
and a 10% flat yield curve.

113
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,540
The modified duration of this 10-year bond is 6.23 years.

114
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,320
Now, if you look at the column in the center of the table,

115
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,620
this corresponds to the initial position of the bond.

116
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,720
The yield change is zero.

117
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,670
There is no movement in the price.

118
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,880
We're now going to consider different changes in the yield.

119
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,340
For example, what if the yield on the bond

120
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,550
moves up by 100 basis points, or by 1%?

121
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,980
The total change in the bond price is going to be minus $6.

122
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,650
The bond price falls by $6.

123
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,330
The duration-based approximation will tell us

124
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,420
that the bond price falls by $6.2.

125
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,340
There is an approximation error of $0.20.

126
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,390
The convexity term is going to correct that to some degree.

127
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,350
It's going to give us plus $0.30.

128
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,160
At the end of the day when we sum up all of these terms,

129
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,520
we see that the approximation is quite accurate.

130
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,970
The error is less than 10 basis points.

131
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,990
If the yield change is larger than that, for example,

132
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,640
300 basis points, 3%, the total decline in the bond price is

133
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,350
going to be $16.50.

134
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,290
The duration-based approximation is going

135
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,240
to be relatively inaccurate.

136
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,860
It will give us $18.70 decline.

137
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,190
The convexity correction is going to be $2.40.

138
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,950
And the overall error is going to be quite modest,

139
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,590
about $0.20.

140
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,240
What we see from this illustration

141
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,420
is that the convexity approximation, the convexity

142
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,990
term, provides a useful degree of correction

143
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,240
when we are concerned with large movements in the yield curve.
