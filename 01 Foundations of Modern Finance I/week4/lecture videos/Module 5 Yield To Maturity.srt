1
00:00:00,846 --> 00:00:03,520
PROFESSOR: Next, we introduce an important concept

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,570
in fixed-income markets called yield to maturity.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,280
If you open the Wall Street Journal

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,010
or you look at quotes for bond prices

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,290
on Bloomberg or another data source,

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,170
you're going to see that bond prices are typically

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,840
quoted not in dollars but in terms of their yield

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,730
to maturity.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,830
Yield to maturity of the bond is defined as the rate of return

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,640
such that if it is applied across all of the maturities

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,030
from 1 to capital T, then the discounted value

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,850
of the cash flows paid by the bond

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,910
is equal to the bond price.

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,140
In other words, as you can see from the formula, if you

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,890
pretend that spot rates across all of the maturities

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,170
are the same and equal to yield to maturity,

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,280
then you should recover the bond price.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,830
Yield to maturity is thus defined as the solution

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,180
of this equation.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,690
Yield to maturity is a quoting convention.

21
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,510
It's a way of quoting bond prices.

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,640
It does not represent the rate of return

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,800
that the bond investor collects.

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,110
It is simply a way of summarizing

25
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,960
price information of the bond in a way that's

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,840
relatively intuitive.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,810
Yield to maturities cannot be used to compare bonds to each

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,590
other.

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,300
A bond with a high yield to maturity

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,330
does not necessarily pay a higher return

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,120
or represent a better deal to the investors.

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,050
Again, these are simply quoting conventions.

33
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,110
Based on the definition, yield to maturity

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,360
is a somewhat complex weighted average

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,270
of spot rates across maturities.

36
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,580
It's a weighted average of interest rates.

37
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,510
Consider the following example.

38
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,370
Suppose that the 1-year interest rate is 5%,

39
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,530
and the 2-year rate is 6%.

40
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,703
These are the spot rates.

41
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:53,620
These are the rates of interest that investors

42
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,800
can collect in the market.

43
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,250
Now consider a 2-year treasury with a principal payment

44
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,460
of $100 and a coupon rate of 6%.

45
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,310
This bond pays $6 in the first year

46
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,750
and $106 in the second year.

47
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,520
Let's apply the definition of yield to maturity to this bond.

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,070
First, we compute the bond price.

49
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,160
The price of this bond is equal to 6

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,190
the first payment discounted to the 5% rate

51
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,340
over a single year plus 106--

52
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,870
that's the second payment--

53
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,570
discounted at the 6% interest rate over two years.

54
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,580
The total value, the price of this bond, is $100.05.

55
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,680
To compute the yield to maturity for this bond,

56
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,140
we now need to solve the equation.

57
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,740
$6 discounted at the rate y, yield

58
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,320
to maturity, over a single year plus $106 discounted at yield

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,170
to maturity over two years has to equal

60
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,430
the price of the bond, $100.05.

61
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,380
It turns out that the solution to this equation is 5.97%.

62
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,530
That is the yield to maturity of our bond.

63
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,540
If we plug this into the definition of yield

64
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,450
to maturity, we see the discounting cash

65
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:17,660
flows of this bond at 5.97% recovers the bond price.

66
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,130
As you can see, yield to maturity

67
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,580
falls somewhere between the two interest rates.

68
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,680
It's between 5% and 6%.

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,140
It's a lot closer to 6% because most

70
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,710
of the cash flows of this bond are paid at time 2.

71
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,780
In other words, yield to maturity

72
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,630
is some kind of weighted average of the spot rates.

73
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,580
But it is not a simple arithmetic average.

74
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,050
It's a solution of a somewhat complicated equation.

75
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,760
So it's a nonlinear function of the spot rates.

76
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,570
Yield to maturity has several simple properties

77
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,300
in relation to the coupon rate of the bond, which

78
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,300
are useful to keep in mind for thinking qualitatively

79
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,080
about how prices of bonds, their coupon rates, and yield

80
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,960
to maturity are related to each other.

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,950
First of all, bond price is inversely

82
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,470
related to yield to maturity.

83
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,600
As you increase yield to maturity,

84
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,900
you're discounting cash flows of the bond at a higher rate.

85
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,220
And of course, the bond price then declines.

86
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,779
The second property is that the bond sells at par,

87
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,339
meaning that the price of the bond

88
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,680
is equal to the principal payment,

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,440
if and only if yield to maturity is equal to the coupon rate.

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
To see why that is the case, consider

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
a bond with the principal payment

92
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,580
of 1 and the coupon rate c.

93
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,760
The price of this bond is equal to the sum

94
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,370
of its coupons discounted at the yield

95
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,670
to maturity y plus the principal payment, which

96
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,960
is 1, discounted at the yield to maturity back to time 0.

97
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,360
If we use the formula for an annuity with a rate of return

98
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,230
y, we can rewrite the price of the bond as a sum of two terms

99
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,970
that you can see on the right-hand side.

100
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,770
The important thing to note here is

101
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,060
that if the yield to maturity is equal to c, the coupon

102
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,990
rate of the bond, the second term disappears and becomes

103
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,130
equal to 0.

104
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,320
And the first term equals 1.

105
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,830
So the bond price is 1, which is the principal payment.

106
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,910
What this equation tells us is that when yield to maturity

107
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,370
equals the coupon rate, the bond price

108
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,300
is equal to the principal payment of the bond.

109
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,880
The bond price is declining as a function of yield

110
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,420
to maturity, which means that if yield to maturity

111
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,650
exceeds the coupon payment, the bond price is going to trade

112
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,580
at a level below the principal.

113
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,230
In this case, we say that the bond trades at a discount.

114
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,880
It trades below the par value.

115
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,410
If the yield to maturity is lower than the coupon rate,

116
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,380
then the bond is going to trade at a premium,

117
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,000
meaning that the price of the bond

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,020
will exceed the principal payment.
