1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,600
PROFESSOR: Next, we introduce the concept of yield curve.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,900
Let's first consider cash flows of fixed-income securities

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,042
or bonds.

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,750
There are three important characteristics

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,520
that define a bond--

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,268
time to maturity; the principal payment,

7
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:16,810
which is the payment that the bond is

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,320
promising at the maturity date; and the coupon.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,500
For example, the bond that you can see here

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,420
is a three-year bond with a $1,000 face value, or principal

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,180
value, and a 5% annual coupon.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,160
So each year, bond investors receive $50 in coupons.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,110
And at the maturity date, in addition to the last coupon

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,500
payment, they receive a $1,000 principal payment.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,830
We are going to value fixed-income securities using

16
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,070
absence of arbitrage or the law of one price.

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,410
We are going to limit our attention to situations where

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,510
default risk is irrelevant.

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,700
And the only dimension we are going to focus on

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,630
is the time value of money.

21
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,680
In other words, we are going to develop arbitrage relation

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,709
for risk-free bonds, default-free bonds.

23
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,050
Prices of various fixed-income securities

24
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,830
provide information that we need to value other cash flows,

25
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,970
other risk-free cash flows.

26
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,880
Markets provide various sources of information

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,230
about prices of bonds.

28
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,640
We could infer discount rates for different maturities

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,960
from prices of pure discount bonds--

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,230
these are bonds that do not pay coupons--

31
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,050
from prices of regular coupon bonds

32
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,660
or from other fixed-income securities.

33
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,300
At the end of the day, all of these various securities

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,580
are connected to each other by the law of one price

35
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,490
or by absence of arbitrage.

36
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,710
And we can use any combination of fixed-income assets

37
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,660
as long as there is sufficient leverage

38
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,050
to infer prices of other fixed-income securities.

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,020
Next, we define the spot interest rate.

40
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,270
The spot interest rate varies with maturity.

41
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,470
The spot interest rate for maturity t

42
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,470
is the rate of return that the fixed-income investor

43
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,110
is going to receive by investing today and collecting the payoff

44
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,080
t periods from now, t years from now.

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,720
Spot interest rates are indexed by their term, t.

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,150
So when we talk about spot interest rates,

47
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,680
we are talking about the entire term

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,240
structure of interest rates.

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,110
For each maturity, there is a corresponding interest rate.

50
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,520
This collection of interest rates

51
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,570
corresponding to different maturities

52
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,430
is called the yield curve.

53
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,360
If you look at the snapshot of the yield curve,

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,600
on the 8th of June of 2019, you can

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,720
see that the spot rates differ across maturities.

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,600
For example, if you were to invest for a period of one

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,750
year, the interest rate-- the risk-free rate in the market--

58
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,045
would be 1.99%.

59
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:49,098
If you invest for a period of 30 years,

60
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:50,390
the interest rate is different.

61
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,460
It's 2.57%.

62
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,560
It is higher in this case.

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,180
The shape of the yield curve does not

64
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,960
stay constant over time.

65
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,180
It varies.

66
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,770
And next, we are going to discuss

67
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,320
how the shape of the yield curve changes

68
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,570
with economic conditions.

69
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,060
On this graph, you can see the history

70
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,990
of interest rates or the yield curve from 1977 until 2019.

71
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,000
There are several lines on the graph,

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,210
which correspond to interest rates of different maturities.

73
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,930
These are color coded.

74
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,750
We are looking at interest rates for 1, 3, 5, 10, and 30 years

75
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,570
to maturity.

76
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,110
One thing we can see is that there is a common component

77
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,950
in all of these interest rates.

78
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,490
They tend to move to some degree together.

79
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,050
That's an important property of the yield curve.

80
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,290
There is something common about movements in interest rates.

81
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,580
Historically, what we observed is that over the last two,

82
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,820
three decades, interest rates across maturities

83
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,190
have been generally declining and are

84
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,740
now at a relatively low level compared

85
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,480
to the beginning of this sample, which

86
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,830
was late '70s and early '80s.

87
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,990
Another observation is that the difference

88
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,790
between the rates of various maturities

89
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,370
does not stay constant either.

90
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,820
There are periods when interest rates across maturities

91
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,600
are quite different.

92
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,290
Generally, interest rates on short-maturity bonds,

93
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,480
short-maturity fixed-income securities,

94
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,190
are lower than interest rates for longer maturities.

95
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,590
There are times when interest rates seem

96
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,720
to converge across maturities.

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,570
And sometimes, the yield curve even flips, in a sense

98
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,210
that short-term interest rates are higher than long term.

99
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,400
There is a correlation between these events

100
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,600
and general economic conditions.

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,120
What we have seen historically is that typically, convergence

102
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,250
of interest rates or inversion of the yield

103
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,900
curve with the long rates declining relative

104
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,700
to short rates tends to happen at the beginning

105
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,960
of recessionary periods.

106
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,210
This is not an exact law.

107
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,500
It is a statistical relation.

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,000
