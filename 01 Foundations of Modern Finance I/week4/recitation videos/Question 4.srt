00:00:01,115 --> 00:00:02,990
PROFESSOR: In this question, I will teach you

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,320
how to find yield to maturity.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,740
Consider the following three-year bond.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,790
It pays annual coupon.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,390
It has face value of $100.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,600
And the coupon rate of 5.25%.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,270
The current spot interest rates are as follows.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,990
The one year rate is 1.1%.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,260
The two-year rate is 1.15%.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,060
And the three-year rate is 1.50%.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,670
We will compute yield to maturity on this bond.

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,800
The first step in solving this question

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,110
is to find the price of the bond.

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,350
Now we know how to find the price of the bonds

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,010
so we're just taking the term structure of interest rates

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,800
that we're given and we're discounting

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,020
each of the payments that we're getting from the bond

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,070
to present using the term structure of interest rates.

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,580
So first, we are taking the first coupon.

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:10,310
So it's $5.25 so recall that this bond pays 5.25% percent

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,840
coupon.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,220
And so at the end of year one, we get $5.25.

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,640
At the end of year two, we get another $5.25.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,350
At the end of year three, we get the last coupon again $5.25.

25
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,147
And at the same time, we get the face value payment

26
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:28,730
from the bond.

27
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,830
That's another 100.

28
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,140
And so we're discounting each of these payments using

29
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,070
the corresponding spot rates to present.

30
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:45,770
And this gives us the price of the bond of $110.98.

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,460
Now the second step is to write down the following equation.

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,510
So this is definition of yield to maturity.

33
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,570
Yield to maturity is the interest rate

34
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:02,070
that if we're using it to discount all of the cash flows

35
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,480
that we get from the bond, we get

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,148
the current price of the bond.

37
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:07,440
So therefore, we can write down the following question.

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,260
So 110.98-- this is the current price of this bond--

39
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,830
equals to the first coupon discounted

40
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,980
to present at YTM, the second coupon discounted

41
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,630
to present at YTM, plus the last coupon and the face value

42
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,660
discounted to present at the YTM as well.

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,930
So now all we have to do is that we

44
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,320
have solve this equation for y.

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,410
So this is just one equation with one unknown.

46
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,360
The only problem here is that this equation looks non-linear.

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,170
So in principle, this is a cubic equation.

48
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,740
So we have to use a lot of effort

49
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,320
to actually solve this equation for y.

50
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,720
So I'm going to show you how to do this in Excel.

51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,400
You can also use your calculators

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,050
or any other software that solves non-linear equations.

53
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,230
I will show you two different functions

54
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,832
that we can use to find yield to maturity in Excel.

55
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:07,290
What I have done in the spreadsheet

56
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,810
is I have entered basic information about our bond.

57
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:17,610
So this face value of $100, the coupon rate of 5.25%, and these

58
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,070
are these spot interest rates which

59
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,970
we used to find the current price of the bond.

60
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,610
So now here, I will use the rate function.

61
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,910
So if you start adding rate, you will

62
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,450
see that this function requires a certain number of inputs.

63
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,210
And these are the inputs that I've put here on top.

64
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,420
So the first input would be the number

65
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,720
of periods, which in the bond speak is

66
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,740
time to maturity of the bond.

67
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,840
So it has three years to maturity

68
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,570
and so therefore it makes three payments.

69
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,340
So this will be our first input.

70
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,360
The second input would be the periodic payment

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,900
that our bond makes.

72
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,070
So in our case this is annual coupon rate, which is $5.25.

73
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,850
So this is the second input into this rate function.

74
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,040
The third input is the present value or the current price

75
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
of the bond.

76
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,910
Note that it is important to enter the price of the bond

77
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,810
with a negative sign.

78
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,640
So here I have negative 110.98.

79
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,870
So this is my second input.

80
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,360
This is my third input.

81
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,780
So the price of the bond again, it is negative.

82
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,560
And the last input is the face value.

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,280
So this is our terminal payment that we

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,240
get from this instrument at the end of year three.

85
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,610
So you could see how this function is structured.

86
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,670
So it has the current present value, which is negative.

87
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,940
It has a terminal payment which is the future or face

88
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,830
value which is positive.

89
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,630
It has periodic payments.

90
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,920
This is the second argument in this function

91
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,080
which is positive.

92
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,330
And then the first one is the number of periods.

93
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,830
So if we close this and we hit Enter,

94
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,320
this gives us a yield to maturity

95
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,230
on this bond, which is 1.48%.

96
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,000
Now the second way of solving this equation

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,360
is to use internal rate of return function.

98
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,780
So here what I've done is that I'm

99
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,440
showing the cash flows that we get from this bond.

100
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,855
So again, in year zero, we have negative 110.98.

101
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,230
So this is the price of the bond.

102
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,980
So if we are a buyer of this bond,

103
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,880
so this is our negative cash outflow in year zero.

104
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,660
And then we have positive 5.25, positive 5.25,

105
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,450
and positive 105.25.

106
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,410
So another way of computing yield to maturity

107
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,820
is just simply to use Internal Rate of Return function IRR

108
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,970
and then just entering the array of our cash flows.

109
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,340
And simply hitting Enter.

110
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,000
This will give us the identical answer.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,640
So the yield to maturity on this bond is 1.48%.

112
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,900
Now we do not know what internal rate of return is yet.

113
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,140
We will learn this concept later in the course.

114
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,960
But the yield to maturity on the bond

115
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,180
is, in fact, the internal rate of return

116
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,870
if you think of this bond as your investment.

117
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,050
So therefore, we can use both rate function and internal rate

118
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,550
of return.

119
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,350
You could see that the internal rate of return function

120
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,725
is actually much easier to use because all you have to do

121
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,060
is that you have to enter the area of cash flows

122
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,160
that you get from this bond.

123
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,250
But we can use either of the two functions

124
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,680
to find the yield to maturity in Excel.
