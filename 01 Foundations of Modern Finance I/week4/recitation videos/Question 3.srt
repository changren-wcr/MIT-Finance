1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,880
PROFESSOR: In this question, I will teach you

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,260
how to find the price of a bond from a given

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,288
yield to maturity, or YTM.

4
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:10,705
Let's consider the following bond.

5
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:14,510
It has five years until maturity.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,540
It has face value of $100.

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,910
The coupon rate is 4.5%, and this bond pays annual coupons.

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,970
And the yield to maturity on this bond right now is 3.15%.

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,310
So given this information, the goal

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,990
is to find the price of this bond.

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:41,440
Now, if we're given YTM on any given bond, to find its price,

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,160
all we have to do is we have to take all of the cash flows

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,450
that this bond produces and discount them to present

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,330
using yield to maturity.

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,630
And this is exactly what I will do in this question.

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,750
So here, I have the cash flows that we

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,000
get from holding this bond.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,110
I draw a timeline this way, and so the first payments

19
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,490
in year one--

20
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,500
or precisely at the end of year one-- we get is $4.50.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,480
This is the coupon rate multiplied

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,650
by the face value of this bond, so $100 times 4.5%.

23
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,420
This is $4.50.

24
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,430
This is how much this bond pays to us at the end of year one.

25
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,520
At the end of year two, we get exactly the same payments,

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,890
so $4.50--

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,130
at the end of year three, third coupon, same exact dollar

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,950
value--

29
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,470
at the end of year four, another $4.50.

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,230
Now, at the end of year five, we'll get our last coupon,

31
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,510
$4.50, plus we get the face value, $100,

32
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,600
paid to us when this bond matures at the end of year

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,950
five.

34
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,070
Now, we're taking all of these cash flows from this bond

35
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,060
and we're discounting them to present using YTM.

36
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,340
In this equation, it is represented by letter y.

37
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,860
So the first payment we're discounting

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,915
to present by 1 plus y.

39
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:13,290
The second one, because it occurs at the end of year two,

40
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,460
is 1 plus y squared, 1 plus y raised to the power of 3,

41
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,030
and so forth.

42
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,710
The very last payment--

43
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,230
1 plus y raised to the power of 5.

44
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,330
So the only thing we have to do here

45
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,990
is that we have to plug in this YTM,

46
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,730
or this y, which is 3.15% into this equation

47
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,170
and find each of these individual ratios, add them up,

48
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,200
and this will give us the price of this bond.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,440
Now, what I have done here is I've plugged in this y

50
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,600
into this equation and computed the bond price.

51
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,840
So the bond price is $106.16.

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,460
So this is how we find the bond price

53
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,935
from given yield to maturity.

54
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:58,560
In the next question, what I will teach

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,940
you is I will give you the bonds with a given bond price

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,430
and I will ask you to do the converse calculation.

57
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,990
So from given price, we will learn how to compute yield

58
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,470
to maturity on a given bond.

59
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,858
Now, let's discuss very important irregularity here.

60
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:19,650
So notice the relationship between the face

61
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,960
value of these bonds, which is $100,

62
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,720
and its price, which is $106.

63
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,750
The price is higher than the face value.

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,020
In this question, this happens because the coupon rate

65
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,920
on this bond, 4.5%, is higher than the yield

66
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,200
to maturity, which is 3.15%.

67
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,340
In this case, we are saying that this bond

68
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,140
is priced at a premium because coupon rate is higher

69
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,340
than the yield to maturity.

70
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,770
If the yield to maturity was the same as the coupon rate,

71
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,340
so let's say that yield to maturity in this question

72
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,883
is 4.5%.

73
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:59,550
We will find that the price of this bond

74
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,300
equals to $100, in which case, we say that this bond is priced

75
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,570
at par.

76
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,530
Now, conversely, if yield to maturity

77
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,140
here was higher than the coupon rate of 4.5%, what

78
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,640
we would have found in this question

79
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,390
is that the bond price would be less than the face

80
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,279
value of this bond.

81
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,350
So it would be less than $100, in which case, we

82
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,090
say that these bonds would have been priced at a discount.

83
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,030
This happens, again, when the coupon rate

84
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,670
is lower than the yield to maturity on this bond.
