1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,170
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,490
learn how to identify arbitrage opportunities in the bond

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,650
market and how to take advantage of such opportunities.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,270
Suppose that you're a bond trader

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,670
and you see the following bonds and their prices

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,900
on your screen.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,010
So there are three bonds--

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,570
A, B, and C. All three have face value of $100.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,490
They have corresponding maturities

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,570
of one, two, and three years, following coupon rates

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,000
and prices.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,290
Now there is another bond, bond D, that just became available

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,120
in the market.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,000
It has the same face value of $100 as bonds A, B,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,480
and C. It has three years to maturity and a 3% coupon rate.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,560
Its current price is $99.50.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,860
The first question asks us, if there is an arbitrage

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,580
opportunity in this market, and if yes

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,280
asks us to explain how we would take

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,732
advantage of such opportunity.

21
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,690
The first step that we will do in this question

22
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,820
is that we will find the term structure of interest rates

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,700
based on the prices of bonds that are given to us.

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,910
So in particular, we would use prices

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:27,950
of bonds A, B, and C to find interest rates r1, r2, and r3.

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,450
So these are the spot interest rates

27
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,140
for Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3.

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,640
We would, generally speaking, follow

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,620
exactly the same approach as we've

30
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,870
learned in the first question that we've covered.

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,970


32
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,350
So let's start with bond A. The price of bond A is given to us

33
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,085
as $96.90.

34
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:53,460
So the current price of this bond

35
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,430
because this is a zero coupon bond,

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,030
it pays $100 which is its face value at the end of year 1.

37
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,610
So therefore the current price should

38
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,030
equal to the face value discounted

39
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,590
to present at the one-year spot interest rate.

40
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,422
So we have this first equation.

41
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:16,130
What we do is that we solve this equation

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:22,760
for r1, which gives us one-year spot interest rate, r1.

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,145
In this case, it equals to 3.2%.

44
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,430


45
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,490
Now we turn our attention to bond B.

46
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,170
We can write down the following pricing

47
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,870
equation for bond B. The price of Bond B which is given to us

48
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,680
is $99, it should be equal to the first coupon discounted

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,880
to present plus the second coupon plus the face value

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,010
discounted to present.

51
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,920
Remember, this is a two-year maturity bond.

52
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,240
It pays 2.75% coupon rate.

53
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,140
So therefore the dollar value of the annual coupon

54
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,760
that this bond pays is $2.75.

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,740
So we take the first coupon and we're

56
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,420
discounting it to present at one-year spot rate r1.

57
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,940
And we take the second coupon and the face value,

58
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,610
which we get at the end of year two.

59
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,950
And we discount it to present at r2

60
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,120
which is a two-year spot rate.

61
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,070
So the goal is to solve this equation for r2.

62
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,570
Glancing at this equation, it looks

63
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,780
like we have r1 and r2 in this equation.

64
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,280
But the good news is that we already

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,970
know r1, which we found from the price of bond A which was 3.2%.

66
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,260
So therefore we can plug this r1 into the above equation

67
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,420
and use it to solve for r2.

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:55,150
Solving that equation for r2 gives us 3.28%.

69
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,660
So this is year-two spot rate.

70
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,120
So to recap what we've done so far,

71
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,570
we've found one-year spot rate which is 3.2%,

72
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:12,500
we found year-two spot rate which is 3.28%.

73
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,710
Now the final step is to take the price of bond C

74
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:20,140
which is a three-year zero-coupon bond currently

75
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,610
traded at $88.55.

76
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,300
And based on this equation, we will find year three spot

77
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,400
rate or r3.

78
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,140
So the good news is that this equation is fairly simple.

79
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,190
In the sense that this is a zero-coupon bond.

80
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,770
So there are no intermediate coupons

81
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,370
that this bond pays in Year 1 and Year 2.

82
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,920
We've covered a situation like this in Question 1.

83
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,290
So here, just for simplicity, we've

84
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,150
given you a zero-coupon bond.

85
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,250
So solving this equation for r3 becomes fairly easy.

86
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:01,140
If we solve it, we get r3 that equals to 4.14%.

87
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,090
So what we've found so far is that we

88
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,520
found the term structure of interest rates

89
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,700
for the first three years, for Year 1, 2, and 3.

90
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,400
So Year 1 interest rate equals the 3.2%.

91
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,550
Year 2 interest rate equals to 3.28%.

92
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,540
And Year 3 interest rate equals to 4.14%.

93
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,930
Now let's examine whether bond D is priced fairly

94
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,782
given the current term structure of interest rates.

95
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:31,240
That, of course, assumes that bonds

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,800
A, B, and C are fairly priced.

97
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,550


98
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,150
So recall that bond D is, again, so it

99
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,590
has three years to maturity.

100
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,880
It has 3% coupon rate.

101
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,110
So therefore it pays $3 coupon at the end of Year 1,

102
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,680
$3 coupon at the end of Year 2, $3 coupon at the end of Year 3,

103
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,050
plus the face value of $100 that it also

104
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,610
pays at the end of Year 3.

105
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,640
So therefore, we can write down the following equation.

106
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,310
So we're taking the first coupon,

107
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,400
discounting it to present at Year 1 interest rate,

108
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,750
spot rate, which is 3.2%.

109
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,440
We take the second coupon, which is again $3

110
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,370
and we are discounting it to present at the Year 2 spot

111
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,770
rate which is 3.28%.

112
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,710
And the last payment of 3 plus $100, we're

113
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,930
discounting at Year 3 spot interest rate of 4.14%.

114
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:34,040
So if you compute this, it gives us the price of $96.93.

115
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,080
But recall that the quoted price of this bond was $99.50.

116
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,090
So therefore, bond D appears to be overpriced, overpriced

117
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,330
relative to its fair price.

118
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,120
And therefore this presents an arbitrage opportunity.

119
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,120
So to take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity, what

120
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,910
we should do are generally two things.

121
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,760
So we either sell an overpriced bond

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,510
or we buy the underpriced bond, or any asset for that matter.

123
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,350
In this case, since bond D was overpriced,

124
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,350
to take advantage of this opportunity we should be

125
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:20,180
selling this bond at the quoted price or at $99.50.

126
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,000
