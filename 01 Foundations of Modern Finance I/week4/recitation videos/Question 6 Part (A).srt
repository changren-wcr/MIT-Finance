1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:02,180
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,900
learn about interest rate risk.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,610
Suppose that you manage a pension

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,370
fund and your liabilities consist of the following three

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,760
payments.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,100
10 years from now, you have to make a payment of $40 million.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,110
In 15 years from now, you have to make

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,670
another payment of $75 million.

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,160
And in 20 years from now, you have

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,200
to make a payment of $105 million.

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,100
This is an approximation how actual pension funds work.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,720
Usually pension funds have to distribute pension payments

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,100
to a rate that is obviously more frequently

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,390
than every five years.

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,950
So this is just an approximation how a regular pension

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,060
fund works.

17
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,880
But you will see that the tools that we'll

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,950
learn in this question can be extended

19
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,277
to a more realistic scenario.

20
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:53,610
We will assume that the term structure of interest rates

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,140
is flat at 5%.

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,770
Part A of the question asks us to use modified duration

23
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,849
to determine what happens to the present value of liabilities

24
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,730
of this pension fund when interest rates increase

25
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,340
by 0.2%.

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,550
And in part B of the question, we'll

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,150
compute the actual change in the present value of liabilities

28
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,600
of the pension fund again when interest rates increase

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,640
by 0.2%.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,760
To compute the modified duration of the liabilities

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,800
of this pension fund, let's first

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,910
start by computing its Macaulay duration.

33
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,160
By definition, the Macaulay duration

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,660
is given by this expression.

35
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,510
So this is the same expression as we've

36
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,580
seen in the previous question.

37
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,240
So let's first compute the present value

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,640
of the liabilities of this pension fund so that's our p.

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,310
So in other words, let's compute the present value

40
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,070
of all the future liabilities of this pension fund.

41
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,080
So this is given by this expression.

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,340
So we have to make our first payment of 40 million dollars

43
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,120
in the year 10.

44
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,170
So the present value of there is 40 divided by 1 plus 5.

45
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,160
5 is our current yield to maturity.

46
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,060
raised to the power of 10 because this payment

47
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,650
occurs in the year 10.

48
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,650
Plus $75 million dollars.

49
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,890
This is our second payment that occurs in year 15.

50
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,810
And finally $105 million is our last and third payment

51
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,040
that occurs in year 20.

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,730
So we're discounting it to present again

53
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,900
at 5% interest rate.

54
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,390
And we're raising it to power 20 again because this cash

55
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,230
flow occurs in the year 20.

56
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,450
So this gives us the present value

57
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,920
or the value of the future, the present value

58
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,350
of the future liabilities of this pension fund

59
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:55,470
which is $100.21 million.

60
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,180
Now the Macaulay duration, again,

61
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,510
is given by this equation.

62
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,720
So we've computed p, the price.

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,990
So now we can compute the remaining term.

64
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,780
So this sum term, which here consists of just three

65
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,890
turns because we have three liability payments.

66
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,010
So 1 divided by 100.21, this is one

67
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,250
divided by the price or the present value

68
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,620
of our liabilities multiplied by 40 divided by 1

69
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,750
plus 5% raised to the power of 10,

70
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,940
so this is the present value of the first liability

71
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,100
payment multiplied by 10.

72
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,350
So this is the year when this payment occurs.

73
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,090
Plus 75 divided by 1 plus 5% raised to the power of 15,

74
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,660
again this is the present value of the second payment

75
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,740
multiplied by 15.

76
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,810
This is the year when it occurs.

77
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,000
Plus 105 or divided by 5% raised to the power of 20 times 20.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,930
Because that payment occurs in the year 20.

79
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,230
So when we compute this, the Macaulay duration

80
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:01,780
of our liabilities is 15.75 years.

81
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,600
Now the modified duration by definition

82
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,500
is just Macaulay duration divided by 1 plus yield.

83
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,890
So in our case, this would be 15.75 divided by 1 plus 5%.

84
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,600
And this will give us exactly 15.

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,490
So the modified duration of our liabilities of this pension

86
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,950
fund is just 15.

87
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,200
Now what we want to do right now is

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,530
that we want to use this modified duration

89
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,390
to approximate the change in value of our liabilities

90
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,340
when a yield curve shifts.

91
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,500
So to be precise technically speaking,

92
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,840
when is it going to be a parallel shift in the yield

93
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,340
curve.

94
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,060


95
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,630
The value, the change in the value of our liabilities,

96
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,670
can be approximated using the following equation.

97
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,220
So the change in the value, this is

98
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,740
delta P would equal to the original value

99
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,360
of our liabilities times the modified duration

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,800
times the change in the yield.

101
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,040
And this goes with the negative sign because the value--

102
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,565
the price of the bond or the value of the bond and yields

103
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:09,940
change in the opposite direction.

104
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,780
So if yields increase the value of bonds will decrease.

105
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,400
And so this is what will happen in our case.

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,540
So now let's use the numbers that we have in this question

107
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,570
so the assumption is that the yield curve shifts up by 0.2%.

108
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,850
So therefore the value of our holdings

109
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,060
will change by this much.

110
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,020
So we are taking the original $121 million,

111
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,910
we're multiplying it by the modified duration which is 15.

112
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,800
And we're multiplying it by the change

113
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,290
in the yield, which is 0.2%.

114
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,180
And this gives us negative $3 million.

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,650
So as yield increases by 0.2%, the value of our liabilities

116
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,890
drops by 3 million dollars.

117
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:04,310
And this answer is given to us by using this approximation

118
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,220
in which we're using the modified duration to compute

119
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,860
the approximate change in the value of our liabilities.
