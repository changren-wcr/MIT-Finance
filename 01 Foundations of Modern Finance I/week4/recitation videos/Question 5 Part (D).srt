1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,890
PROFESSOR: Let's summarize this question.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,490
For a zero-coupon bond that matures in 20 years,

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,710
Macaulay duration was 20.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,750
Modified duration was 19.61.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,760
For a perpetual bond, Macaulay duration was 51.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,710
Modified duration was 50.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,150
And for a coupon bond--

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,850
5% coupon bond that matures in 20 years--

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,750
Macaulay duration was 14.43 and modified duration was 14.15.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,945
Let's compare a and c.

11
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:35,820
So one of the key things that we learned here

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,330
is that for a zero-coupon bond, the Macaulay duration equals

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,120
the maturity of the bond.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,030
And so in that case, it was 20.

15
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,060
Now, for the bond that also has 20 year maturity

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,190
but pays a coupon, Macaulay duration

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,350
has to be strictly less than 20.

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,320
So if you compare a and c, again, c

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,960
has Macaulay duration of 14.43, which is less than 20.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,600
Now, if we compare b and c--

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,060
so both of these bonds pay the same coupon, but bond in c

22
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,860
has 20 years to maturity and bond in b is a perpetual bond.

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,080
And so here, of course, you see that the longer

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,930
the maturity of the bond, the higher is the Macaulay

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,440
duration.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,130
So in this particular case, the Macaulay duration

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,600
is 51, which is much higher than the Macaulay duration

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,780
for a 5% coupon bond that matures just in 20 years.

29
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,380
Generally speaking, if we're comparing two bonds,

30
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,200
both of which have the same yield to maturity

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,430
and the same coupon rate, the bond that matures later

32
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,230
will have higher duration.

33
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,000
