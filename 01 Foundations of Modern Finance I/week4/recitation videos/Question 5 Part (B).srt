1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,420
PROFESSOR: In part b, we are given a perpetual bond.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,720
So this bond pays 5% coupon, and it has $100 face value.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,440
Coupons are paid annually.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,380
If you were to measure the stream of cash flows

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,480
that you get from this bond, it is $5 paid annually

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,220
and it's in perpetuity.

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,590
So we will start this question by deriving modified duration.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,022
And then, we'll come back to Macaulay duration.

9
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:34,980
You will see, because this would be the easiest

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,250
to actually derive the modified duration first, and then

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,190
go back to Macaulay duration.

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,530
So by definition, modified duration

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,320
is negative 1 over P multiplied by the derivative of the bond

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,430
price with respect to yield to maturity, y.

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,180


16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,870
The price of perpetual bond that pays coupon C

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,890
annually is given by this because, again, this is just

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,240
a simple perpetuity with a discount rate of y

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,810
that pays C, which is the annual coupon payment, every year.

20
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,130
And as we've learned in lecture three,

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,630
the present value of this perpetuity

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,820
is simply C divided by y.

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,850
Now, what we will do is we will first

24
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,800
find the derivative of the price of the bond with respect to y.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,580
And this is very simply just negative C divided by y

26
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,780
squared.

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,920
Because, again, the price of the bond was just C divided by y.

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,760
And now, we can plug this back into the modified duration

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,980
equation.

30
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,640
And this is going to give us minus 1

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,330
over P multiplied by minus C divided by y squared.

32
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,730
And so you could see that C cancels out.

33
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,490
y in the numerator and denominator-- one of them

34
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,950
cancels out, and so what is left is just 1 over y.

35
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,870
So therefore, the modified duration for a perpetual bond

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,980
is simply just 1 divided by y.

37
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,230
In our case, yield to maturities are 2% this bond.

38
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,510
And so therefore, the modified duration

39
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,660
of this perpetual bond that is given in this question

40
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,600
is just 50.

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,920
Notice that it doesn't matter what

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,050
coupon rate the perpetual bond actually pays.

43
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,630
So the only thing that modified duration depends on

44
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,520
is just the yield to maturity of the bond.

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,480


46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,200
Now, the Macaulay duration, we can

47
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,980
compute based on the modified duration that we just computed.

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,540
Remember that duration of the Macaulay duration

49
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,900
is just modified duration multiplied by 1 plus y.

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,450
And we know that the modified duration is 1 over y.

51
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,820
So therefore, the Macaulay duration is just 1

52
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,660
plus y divided by y.

53
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,560
And so therefore, in our case, given that y is 2%,

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,290
the Macaulay duration will be just 1 plus 2% divided by 2%.

55
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,570
And that's going to be 51.

56
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,880
So therefore, to summarize this question

57
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,550
is that for this perpetual bond, given

58
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,660
that yield to maturity in this bond is 2%,

59
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,090
its Macaulay duration is 51.

60
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,530
And it's modified duration is 50.
