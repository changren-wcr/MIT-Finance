1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,970
PROFESSOR: Now suppose that the interest rates

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,150
drop by 1.5% at all maturities.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:13,360
This means that the yield curve shifted downwards by 1.5%.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,940
So first we will use the modified duration

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,540
to determine first-order approximate change in this bond

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,810
price.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,377
So this is exactly what we have done in the previous question.

8
00:00:25,377 --> 00:00:26,960
So the change in the price of the bond

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,670
is going to be negative again, negative sign because yields

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,183
and prices go in the opposite directions.

11
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:36,100
So is it going to be a negative original price

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,860
of the bond, multiplied by the modified duration,

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,490
multiplied by the change in the yield.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,337
So recall that the price of this bond is 106.77.

15
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,920
The modified duration that we computed

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,940
in part A of this question is 4.41.

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,760
And we're multiplying it by negative 1.5%,

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,300
so this is the drop in the yield curve.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:07,030
So doing this calculation gives us delta P equal to $7.06.

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,560
So therefore, as interest rates drop by 1.5%,

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,350
the bond price increased approximately by $7.06.

22
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,000
