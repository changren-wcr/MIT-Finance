1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,110
PROFESSOR: Let's compute the actual change

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,030
in value of our liabilities.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,460
So the new yield curve right now is flat at 5.2%.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,990
So all we need to do here is that we

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,960
need to take this new yield and compute

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,930
the current present value of the liabilities of this pension

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,050
fund.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,080
So this is the same expression as we had before,

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,120
when the yield curve was at 5%.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,620
So right now, the only difference

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,730
here is that we're using the new yield of 5.2%.

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,950
If we compute this present value of liabilities,

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:38,180
we will find that the value is $97.25 million.

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,370
So therefore, the actual decrease in value

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,770
is what it was before.

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,550
And before, the value was $100.21 million.

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,880
And the current value is $97.25.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,500
So the actual decrease in value is $2.96 million.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,220
This is by how much the present value of our liabilities

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,099
dropped as a result of the increase in the yield,

21
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,290
or, again, the parallel shift in the yield curve.

22
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,220


23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,300
So let's summarize.

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,990
When we used the modified duration

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,388
and we found the approximate change

26
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:18,180
in the value of our liabilities, the answer

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,230
was that it decreased by $3 million.

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,120
Now, when we compute the actual decrease,

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,170
the actual decrease was $2.96 million.

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,840
So it's actually less than what was approximated

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,815
by the modified duration.

32
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:35,190
Now, the first thing to note here

33
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,398
is that apparently, modified duration actually worked

34
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:41,520
really well to give us the approximate change in the value

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,960
of our liabilities.

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,420
So the only difference here is $0.04 million.

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,910
But now, let's start to understand

38
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:58,170
why the actual value decreases less than what duration

39
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,330
approximation gives us.

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,030
Let's look at this chart, and the answer

41
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,080
will be that this is due to the convexity of the bond prices,

42
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,460
the function of the yield.

43
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,820
So let's look at the right part of this picture,

44
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,250
so this is where the yield increase.

45
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,210
So if you look at, for example, just hypothetically speaking

46
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,880
on this picture.

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,730
So let's say that the yield changed from 5% to 7%.

48
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,190
So based on this picture, so the blue line here

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,970
is the duration approximation.

50
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,110
By how much, if we are going to use modified duration,

51
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,260
what would be the decrease in the value of our holdings as

52
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,570
implied by the duration?

53
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,270
And the red line is the actual--

54
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,760
is the actual price of the bond.

55
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,910
And you could see that due to the convexity,

56
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:56,360
that the actual decrease in the value of these liabilities

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,840
would actually be lower than what it would have been

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,240
if we just used the modified duration

59
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,950
to approximate that change.

60
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,050
And this is precisely what we found in this question.
