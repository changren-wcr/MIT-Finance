1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,170
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,380
learn how to compute bond convexity

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,590
and we'll learn how to use it to approximate the change

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,790
in the value of our holdings or in the value of the bond.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,370
So assume that the yield curve is flat at 3.5%.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,020
We will assume that there is $100 face value

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,060
bond that pays annual coupons and has five years to maturity.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,160
The coupon rate is 5%.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,800
So first we will compute the modified duration of this bond.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,180
Second we will compute its convexity,

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,010
then we will use modified duration of this bond

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,740
to try to find the approximate change in the value

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,040
of the bonds when interest rates drop or the yield curve

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,460
drops by 1.5%.

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,880
This is exactly what we have done in question 6.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,960
Then we will actually use convexity,

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,630
the one that we'll compute in part B of this question

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,420
to find the approximate change in the value of the bond

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,770
when interest rates drop by the same 1.5%.

20
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,280
And then in the last part we'll compute the actual change

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,975
in the value of the bond and then

22
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:13,900
we will compare that actual change to parts C and D

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,990
of the question and see how well both parts C

24
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,660
and D approximate the actual change

25
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,950
in the value of this bond.

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,550
Let's start by computing the modified duration of this bond.

27
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,040
So this is very similar to what we have done in question 5

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,818
and the spreadsheet has the same template.

29
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:35,360
The only difference is that this bond

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,880
has five years to maturity.

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,680
So the YTM on this bond, the current YTM, is 3.5%,

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,160
its face value is $100 and this bond pays 5% annual coupon.

33
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,660
So here we have the cash flows that we get from this bond

34
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,720
and the first step what I will do

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,220
is that I need to compute its price.

36
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,500
So I will compute the present value of this cash flow.

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,005
So we've already done this calculation several times.

38
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:14,690


39
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,720
And so if I compute present value for each of these five

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,430
payments, I add them up.

41
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,460


42
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,740
This will be the price of the bond.

43
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,150
Again, I always recommend making sure that the price of the bond

44
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,180
makes sense.

45
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,160
So in this case, we expect this bond to be priced at a premium

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,740
because the coupon rate of this bond is higher than its yield

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,520
to maturity.

48
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,040
And so the price of the bond, 106

49
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,600
is above the face value of $100, so this makes sense.

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,860
So now the next step I will compute the present value

51
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,930
of each of these individual payments

52
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,785
and multiply it by the year in which it occurs.

53
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:02,240


54
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,405
I will add them up as well.

55
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:07,280
And then I will compute the Macaulay duration

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,568
by taking the sum and dividing by the price of the bond.

57
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,860
And so this would be the Mcaulay duration of this bond.

58
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,330
So it's 4.56%.

59
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,650
Again, recall the other check is that we expect the Mcaulay

60
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,550
duration here because this is a coupon paying bond,

61
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,730
we expect the Mcaulay duration to be lower

62
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,000
than the maturity of the bond.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,330
So the maturity of this bond is five years,

64
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,990
the Mcaulay duration is 4.56.

65
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,750
And finally, the modified duration

66
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,630
is just the Macaulay duration divided

67
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,660
by 1 plus the current yield.

68
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,510
So the answer here will be that the modified duration is 4.41.

69
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,000
