1
00:00:00,952 --> 00:00:02,660
PROFESSOR: In part c, we're asked

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,830
to compute duration of a 5% coupon $100

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,820
face value bond that has 20 years to maturity.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,340
Let's start with Macaulay duration.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,700
Again, this is the definition of Macaulay duration written

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,310
for this particular bond.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,530
So capital T here is 20.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,530
This is the number of years until the maturity

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,970
of this bond.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,330
And since this bond pays annual coupon,

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,360
the annual payment that we get from this bond is $5.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,910
So all we need to do here is that we

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,770
need to compute the price of this bond and compute this sum.

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,120
And this will give us the Macaulay duration.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,470
So we can compute this by hand.

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,980
But it's a little bit tedious because we have to--

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,920
we have 20 periods.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,410
And for each of the period, we have to compute these numbers.

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,080
So what I will do is that I will use

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,390
Excel to illustrate how to compute

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,080
the duration for this bond.

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,990
In this Excel spreadsheet, I have put some basic information

23
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,830
about this bond.

24
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,459
So the current YTM is 2%.

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,680
Face value is $100.

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,720
Coupon rate is 5%.

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,160
So this bond has 20 years to maturity.

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,120
So therefore each year it pays $5 coupon up until year 20,

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,250
when it pays the last final coupon of $5

30
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,880
plus the face value of 100.

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,610
So the first step that I will do here

32
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,040
is that I will compute the price of the bond.

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,110
Because if you just look at the, again,

34
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,510
definition of Macaulay duration, we

35
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,330
need to know the price of the bond to compute the duration.

36
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,490
So I will discount each of the individual coupons and cash

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,870
flows to present.

38
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,240
Then I will add them up and this will be the price of this bond.

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,150
So I'll start with the very first coupon,

40
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,310
so I'll take this $5.

41
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,180
And we'll divide it divided by 1 plus yield

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,180
to maturity on this bond.

43
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,200
And I will raise it to power 1 in this case.

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,740
This is when this cash flow occurs.

45
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,490
And then I will do this for all of the 20 payments.

46
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,860
And this is the present value of each

47
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,850
of these individual payments that we get from this bond.

48
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,530
So by definition, if I add this up,

49
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,530
so this would be the price of our bond.

50
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,240


51
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,600
So the price of this bond right now is 149.05.

52
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,500
So first notice that it does make sense.

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,250
So if we compare the price of this bond relative to its face

54
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,790
value, it's 149 versus 100.

55
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,560
And it does make sense because, again,

56
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,890
so this bond has a much higher coupon

57
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,310
rate, which is 5%, relative to its yield to maturity.

58
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,420
So this bond should be priced at a premium

59
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,350
and its price should be above $100.

60
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,130
So the fact that its 149.05 kind of passes the smell

61
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,450
test in the sense that this bond is indeed priced at a premium.

62
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,140
So now the next step, we need to compute the following sum.

63
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,820
So I've written it down in the second equation

64
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,610
where cash flow in the year t divided by 1 plus yield raised

65
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,140
of the power of t, is just the present value

66
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,550
of that particular cash flow that occurs in the year t.

67
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,700
And then, each of these present value of cash flow in year two,

68
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,920
we have to multiply it by the year

69
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,037
in which this payment occurs.

70
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:31,370
And then we have to add them up.

71
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,787
So this is how we're going to find

72
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:35,710
the total value of this sum.

73
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,600
So here is exactly what I will do.

74
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,750
So I'll take the present value that we just

75
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,820
computed for the first payment.

76
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,018
And then we'll multiply it by the year

77
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:46,060
when this payment occurs.

78
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,030
In this case, it's Year 1.

79
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,960
So you could see that in Year 2, I

80
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,560
will be taking the present value of the second payment

81
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,110
and multiplying them by the year.

82
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,690
When it occurs again, this is a Year 2.

83
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,990
And so I will do it for each of the payments.

84
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,140
And now I will add them all up.

85
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,240
And this would be the sum that we

86
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,930
get in the duration expression.

87
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,850
And now by definition, all we have

88
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,980
to do is to compute the Macaulay duration,

89
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,699
I have to take this sum that they just computed and divide

90
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,860
it by the price of the bond.

91
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,432
And this will, by definition, be the Macaulay duration.

92
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:32,140
So this is how we can use the spreadsheet

93
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,930
to find the duration of any bond.

94
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,890
So if you have fewer than 20 years,

95
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,930
for example you have two years, three years,

96
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,198
you can do it by hand.

97
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,740
In fact, you should practice to do it

98
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,680
by hand because exam most likely is going

99
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,500
to feature a question where you have to compute the duration

100
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,330
but obviously we're not going to ask

101
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,180
you to compute the duration for, you know, a 20-year bond

102
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,130
because this is too tedious.

103
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,540
But certainly you can do it for a two-year or just a bond

104
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,110
with a shorter maturity.

105
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,760
Now the final step here, what I will do

106
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,320
is that I will compute the modified

107
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,302
duration based on the Macaulay duration

108
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:09,260
that you just computed.

109
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,060
And modified duration would simply be just,

110
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,815
again, the Macaulay duration divided by 1 plus the yield

111
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:20,050
to maturity in this bond which is 2%.

112
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,390
And this is 14.15.

113
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:28,770
So the modified duration for this particular bond is 14.15.

114
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,260
Now notice, going back to Macaulay duration,

115
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,530
notice that this bond has 20 years to maturity.

116
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,400
But its duration is 14.43.

117
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,990
So remember that for bond that pays 0% coupon,

118
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,790
Macaulay duration equals exactly the maturity of the bond.

119
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,700
But for any bond that pays nonzero or positive coupon

120
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,020
the Macaulay duration should be strictly less

121
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,857
than the maturity of the bond.

122
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,440
So in this case, the Macaulay duration

123
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,240
is 14.43 which is less than 20, which again is reasonable

124
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,500
because that number is less than 20.

125
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,000
