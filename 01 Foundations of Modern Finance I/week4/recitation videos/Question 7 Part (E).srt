1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,740
PROFESSOR: Finally let us compute the actual change

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,810
in the price of the bond and then we'll

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,760
compare this change with approximations

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,190
that we obtained in part C and D of this question.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,900
So the new yield to maturity on this bond right now is 2%.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,530
So it was 3.5, dropped by 1.5, so the new YTM is 2%.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,200
So given this new YTM we can compute the bond price

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,450
which will be $114.14.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,330
So therefore, the actual change in the price of this bond

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,110
is $114.14, minus the original price

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:46,150
of the bond, which is $106.77, this will give us $7.37.

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,750
Now let's put this all together.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,390
So the change in value that we obtained

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,230
using first-order approximation or approximation only using

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,678
modified duration was $7.06.

16
00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:04,720
The approximation, the second-order approximation

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,200
that we obtained using both modified duration

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,780
and convexity of this bond is $7.36 and the actual change

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,920
in the price of this bond is $7.37.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,590
Now you can see how remarkably close

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,900
the second-order approximation is

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,930
to actual change in the price of the bond.

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,380
This is because the price of the bond

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,390
as the function of yield to maturity is a convex function.

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,280
And in this question we've given you a very large change

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,290
in yield to maturity.

27
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,880
So the original was 3.5% and it dropped by 1.5%.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,910
Recall that the first-order approximation,

29
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,820
or the approximation using just modified duration

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,100
would work well but only for small change in yields.

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,760
But for these large changes, such as drop by 1.5%,

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,000
the first-order approximation doesn't work that well.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,009
It still works OK, but doesn't work

34
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,730
as well as both modified duration and the convexity

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,350
of the bond, where we can come as close as just

36
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,470
$0.01 within the actual change in the value of this bond.

37
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,000
