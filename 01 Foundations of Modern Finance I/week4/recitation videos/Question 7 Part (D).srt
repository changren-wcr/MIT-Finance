00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,200
PROFESSOR: Now in this question, we

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,800
will use both modified duration and convexity

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,500
that we computed in part B to determine

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,970
a second-order approximate change in the bond price.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,780
The second-order approximate change in the bond price

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,980
is given by the following expression,

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,480
so it's the original price, multiplied by negative modified

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,100
duration, multiplied by the change in YTM,

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,960
plus the convexity of the bond, multiplied

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,740
by the change in YTM squared.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,330
So let's plug in the numbers that we have for the price,

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,670
for the modified duration, and for the convexity of this bond.

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:47,080
So the price is 106.77, the modified duration is 4.41,

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,790
the YTM again drops by 1.5%, the convexity

15
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,920
that we computed in part B of this question is 12.38,

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,660
multiplied by 1.5% squared.

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:08,030
Computing this gives us the change in price of $7.36.

18
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,970
So as YTM drops by 1.5%, the price of this bond

19
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,710
increases by approximately $7.36

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,000
