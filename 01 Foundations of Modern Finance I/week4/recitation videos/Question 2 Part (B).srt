1
00:00:00,786 --> 00:00:03,790
PROFESSOR: Now that we know there is arbitrage opportunity

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,740
in this market, I will teach you how

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,100
to construct an arbitrage trading strategy that

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,780
takes advantage of it.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,060
In particular, we will construct such a strategy

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,780
that pays off $100 today and nothing in the future.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,440
I will teach a very universal approach

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,210
that you can apply to construct arbitrage

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,070
opportunities in any situation.

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,752


11
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:28,210
So we're going to assume that we're

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:35,205
buying xA amount of bond A, xB amount of bond B,

13
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:41,910
xC amount of bond C, and xD amount of bond D. We will allow

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,610
for these amounts for xA, xB, xC, and xD to be negative.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,460
This would imply that we are taking a short position,

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,920
we're selling the corresponding bonds.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,440


18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,070
So we want to construct a strategy that pays--

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,290
gives us $100 today.

20
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,950
We can write the following equation.

21
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,860
Bond prices multiplied by our positions

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,350
should add up to $100.

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,982
Here the key would be that bond prices would

24
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:14,940
come with negative signs because we're taking--

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,020
we're buying these bonds.

26
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,490
So for example, if we're buying one unit of bond A,

27
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,230
we will have to pay right now $96.90.

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,630
This is the price of bond A. So in this case,

29
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,000
we'll have a cash outflow of $96.90.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,340
If we are buying two units of bond A,

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,970
then our cash outflow would be the price multiplied by 2.

32
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,920
So therefore this gives us the left hand side

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,730
of this equation, which means that we're buying xA of bond A,

34
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,140
xB of bond B, xC of bond C, and xD of bond D.

35
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,650
And so this expression gives us our total cash

36
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,290
outflow that we have to spend on buying these bonds.

37
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,540
And so this has to equal to $100 because this

38
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,640
is-- we want a positive cash outflow today

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,390
so we want to construct a strategy that gives us $100

40
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,053
today.

41
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,720
So you can immediately see that for this

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,000
to work that some of this amounts

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,300
xA, xB, and xC, and xD has to be a negative so

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,670
that the corresponding cash flow is positive.

45
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,730
So it makes sense that we would have

46
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,010
to take a negative position or short sell one of these bonds.

47
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,510
You could see that it's likely going

48
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,540
to be bond D because we've just determined

49
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,230
in the previous question that this bond is actually

50
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,190
overpriced.

51
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,140


52
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,190
So this is just the summary of this.

53
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,950
Now the key to arbitrage is that our positions should be such

54
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,700
that the bond payoffs or our payoffs from our trading

55
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,423
strategy are zero in all of the subsequent years.

56
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:57,090
And that is the definition of arbitrage.

57
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,880
So we're making a positive amount today.

58
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,700
So in this particular case, we're going to make $100.

59
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,420
And are positions are fully hatched.

60
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,080
So our cash flows are exactly zero

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,240
in all of the subsequent years.

62
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,700
So here because the maximum maturity of the bonds

63
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,710
here is three years so we have to make sure

64
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:21,180
that in the years 1, 2, and 3 we get $0 cash flows.

65
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,010
Let's start with Year 1.

66
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,040
So recall that bond A is a zero coupon

67
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,400
bond with one year maturity.

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,010
So it pays $100 in the year one.

69
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,830
So therefore, the cash inflow or the positive cash

70
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,260
flow because we bought this bond,

71
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,760
so at the end of the year one, we

72
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,050
get $100 times how many units of this bond we purchased,

73
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,450
so times xA.

74
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,458
Now bond B is a 2.75% coupon bond.

75
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,500
And it's a two-year bond.

76
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,780
So it pays us the first coupon at the end of Year 1.

77
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,980
So we get 2.75 times xB.

78
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,270
And bond D, so bond C is a zero coupon bond so it pays nothing.

79
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,670
And it matures in year three.

80
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,130
And bond D, it's a 3% coupon bond

81
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,640
so it pays us for the first coupon $3

82
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,560
at the end of year one.

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,050
So hence we get the following expression and this

84
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,050
has to equal to $0 because, again, we

85
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,800
have to ensure that our cash flow at the end of year 1

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,790
is exactly 0.

87
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,240


88
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,170
So for Year 2 now bond A pays nothing.

89
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,750
So it pays zero because it already matured.

90
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,020
Now bond B matures actually at the end of year two,

91
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,920
so it pays the second coupon of $2.75.

92
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,940
Plus it pays the face value of $100.

93
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,160
And bond C pays nothing because it's

94
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,680
a zero-coupon bond that matures at the end of year three.

95
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,260
And bond D pays our second coupon.

96
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,160
It pays $3.

97
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,110
So we have the following equation, 102.75 times xB

98
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,000
plus 3 times xD.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,770
And that equals to $0.

100
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,410


101
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,652
So finally for year three, we get-- so at that point in time,

102
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:11,610
bond A already matured.

103
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,240
So it pays nothing.

104
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,560
Bond B also matured, so it pays nothing.

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,710
Bond C pays its face value.

106
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,640
So $100.

107
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,340
And again, recall that this is a 0% coupon bond.

108
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,280
And bond D pays its last coupon which is

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,352
$3 plus its face value, $100.

110
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:35,310
So in year three we get the following equation,

111
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,140
so 100 multiplied by xC plus 103 multiplied by xD.

112
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,000
And that equals to $0.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,330


114
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,870
So let's put this all together.

115
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,340
So we have the following four equations.

116
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,300
So the first equation, it's our cash flow in the year one.

117
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,200
The second equation is our cash flow in the year one.

118
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,270
So the first one is our cash flow in the year zero.

119
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,760
Now, let's put this all together.

120
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,870
We have the following system of four equations

121
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,640
with four unknowns.

122
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,710
These equations represent our cash flows in Years 0, 1, 2,

123
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,170
and 3.

124
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,690
So the goal right now is to solve this system of equations

125
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,332
for xA, xB, and xC, and xD.

126
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:23,790
So here it's fairly straightforward

127
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,360
how to solve this.

128
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,300
So we can see that, for example, the last two

129
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,370
equations, so the tie--

130
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,540
they had just two unknowns.

131
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,040
So they tie xB and xD.

132
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,480
This is Equation 3.

133
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,542
An xC an xD, this is Equation 4.

134
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,000
So what I'm going to do is that I'm

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,300
going to solve the last two equations for xB

136
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,820
as a function of xD and xC as the function of xD.

137
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,440
Now let's look at the second equation.

138
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,800
Second equation has xA, xB, and xD.

139
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,950
So I'm going to plug in the third equation,

140
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:00,870
or xB into the second equation, and then solve it to express xA

141
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:06,240
as a function of xD.

142
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,820
So this is me first-step plugging xB

143
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,510
as the function of xD into this second equation.

144
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,310
And then the next step, I'm solving xA for xD.

145
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,140
So I'm solving the second equation.

146
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,160
And so now the second, third, and fourth equation right now

147
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,690
give us xA, xB, and xC as functions of xD.

148
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,180
And so if we plug these expressions

149
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,020
into the first equation, it will give us

150
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,030
just equation with one unknown.

151
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,015
So we'll have only xD in that equation.

152
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:42,030


153
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,980
So doing that and solving that equation will give us

154
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:52,330
xD equal to negative 38.85.

155
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,850
So what this means, it means that we are selling,

156
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:01,270
we are shorting 38.85 units of bond D.

157
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,180
So here I implicitly assume that I can actually

158
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,570
trade fractions of the bond.

159
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,400
So I can buy any fraction.

160
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,180
So in this case, I'm buying 0.85.

161
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:16,510
So I'm buying 38 whole units and 85 of fraction of bond D.

162
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,650
So now this does make economic sense.

163
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,320
Because we've identified in the first part of this question

164
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,900
is that bond D was overvalued.

165
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,820
It was overpriced.

166
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,130
So it was priced at 99.5.

167
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,630
Well, it's fair price was $96.

168
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,437
So therefore it does make sense for us

169
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:38,020
to take advantage of this opportunity.

170
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,220
We have to actually sell those bonds at this higher price

171
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,600
and therefore get this higher value to us right now.

172
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,180
And then we're going to be taking long positions

173
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,340
in the other three bonds to make sure

174
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,070
that we get $0 payoffs in the Years 1, 2, and 3.

175
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,150
So now, since we have xD, what we can do

176
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,710
is that we are plugging this amount

177
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:10,230
xD that we found in the equations that tie xA with xD,

178
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,870
xB with xD, and xC with xD.

179
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:19,860
And we get the following amounts for xA, xB, and xC.

180
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,990
So xA and xB equal to 1.13, which

181
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:29,850
means that we are buying 1.13 units of bond A 1.13

182
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:37,860
units of bond B. And we are buying 40.02 units of bond C.

183
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,270
So we're taking long positions in these bonds.

184
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,310
Now this is our arbitrage strategy.

185
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,455
So we are selling 38.85 units of bond D

186
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,020
and we're buying the corresponding units of bonds

187
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,610
A, B, and C. Now the final step that I want to do here

188
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,880
is that I want to actually verify that this trading

189
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,900
strategy actually works.

190
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,690
So what I will do is that I will plug

191
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,790
in these amounts of xA, xB, xC, and xD that we found

192
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,980
into our equations to make sure that we

193
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,520
get the cash flows that we are thinking that we're getting.

194
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,900
So if I am plugging these numbers

195
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,840
into the first equation, I get $100.

196
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,140
So which means that me buying the corresponding amounts

197
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,690
of bonds A, B, and C, and shorting

198
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:32,550
the corresponding amounts of bond D gives us exactly $100.

199
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,790
In the Year 1, this equation tells us that we get exactly 0,

200
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,500
as we expect.

201
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,530
In Year 2, we also get 0.

202
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,470
And in Year 3, we also get 0.

203
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,120
So our arbitrage strategy indeed works.

204
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,240
It gives us $100 right now.

205
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,330
And it gives us nothing in the Years 1, 2, and 3.
