1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,610
PROFESSOR: Let's compute convexity of this bond.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,785
I will start with definition.

3
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:09,160
So convexity of the bond is given

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,640
by 1/2 multiplied by the inverse price, multiplied

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,663
by the second derivative of the bond price with respect to YTM.

6
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:20,080
So what I'm going to do right now,

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,455
I will try to expand this formula

8
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,400
by taking the second derivative of the bond price

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,630
with respect to YTM.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,100
So let's write down the bond price as this.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,573
So this is just the present value of cash flows

12
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:34,990
that we get from the bond discount

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,000
at the present at its YTM.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,520
I will take the first derivative,

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,117
which would be given by the following expression.

16
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:45,980


17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,530
Now we'll take the second derivative, which would

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,082
be given by this expression.

19
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:54,790
I will write it down slightly differently

20
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:00,410
by factoring out 1 over 1 plus YTM squared.

21
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,540
So that under the summation sign we

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,430
will get the following expression.

23
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,790
And now I will plug in this derivative

24
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,450
into the definition of the convexity.

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,580
And so I'm going to get 1/2 multiplied

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,960
by the inverse price, multiplied by 1 over 1 plus yield squared,

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,460
multiplied by the following sum.

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,230
Within this following sum, what I

29
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,790
will do is that I will write down

30
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,590
the ratio of cash flow received in the year t,

31
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,350
divided by 1 plus YTM, raised to the power t

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,030
as the present value of this cash flow.

33
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,890
So this is why I factored out 1 plus y squared,

34
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,830
so that I can actually write down

35
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,720
this as the present value of this cash flow.

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,847
And so therefore under this summation sign,

37
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:51,430
we're going to have the present value of cash flow in the year

38
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,268
t multiplied by year t multiplied by year t plus 1.

39
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:58,810
And so this is the expression that we

40
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,630
can use right now to compute the convexity of the bond

41
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,698
that we have in this question.

42
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:06,240
This is a similar spreadsheet that we

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,530
had in part A of this question.

44
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,039
So here we are given our current YTM, the face

45
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,560
value of the bond, the coupon, the cash

46
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,910
flows that we get from the bond.

47
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,285
And we've already found the price

48
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:19,797
of this bond, which was 106.77.

49
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:21,380
So right now let's use this expression

50
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,780
which is derived to compute the convexity of this bond.

51
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,950
So first, for each year 1 through 5,

52
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,780
I will compute this expression that we

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,460
have under the summation sign.

54
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,020
So this is the present value of each

55
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,630
of these cash flows multiplied by t

56
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,010
and multiplied by t plus 1.

57
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,280
So for year 1, I will take the present value

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,800
that we compute it here.

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,350
I will multiply it by year, 1 in this case,

60
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,290
and multiply it by 1 plus another 1.

61
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,290
And I will do this calculation for each of these payments.

62
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,788
And then I will add it up.

63
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:02,830
And so you can see that to compute the convexity,

64
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,960
I need to take 1/2.

65
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,360
I need to divide it by the price of the bond,

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,960
and I need to divide it by 1 plus y squared.

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,180
And so first I will take the sum of these terms.

68
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,352
And then I will divide it by 2, I

69
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:21,370
will multiply it by the price.

70
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:28,990
And then we'll multiply it by 1 plus YTM squared.

71
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,970
And so this would exactly be the convexity of this bond.

72
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,860
So the convexity will be 12.38.

73
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,000
