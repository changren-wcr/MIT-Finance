00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,875
PROFESSOR: In this question, I will teach you

1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:06,430
how to find spot interest rates from given bond prices.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,430
In this question we're given three bonds--

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,320
Bond A, Bond B, and Bond C. Bond A has 0% coupon

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,680
and has one year until it matures.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,530
Bond B has a 3% coupon rate and has two years until it matures.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,130
And bond C has a 3.5% coupon rate

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,090
and has three years until maturity.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,620
Bond prices are given as such.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,280
So Bond A costs $97.60 right now.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,470
Bond B costs $96.

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,130
And Bond C costs $98.

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,500
So the goal is to take this information

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,420
about the bonds in green here and find spot interest

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,000
rates for Years 1, 2, and 3.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,030
So this is the question.

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,980
The first step that we'll do here

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,030
is that we will write the prices of these bonds

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,930
as the function of interest rates.

19
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,850
So let's start with bond A.

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:10,350
So the price of Bond A, PA would equal to $1 face value

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,410
that this bond pays at the end of Year 1 divided

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,620
by 1 plus interest rate r1.

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,730
So this is the one-year spot interest rate.

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,010
One thing to know here is that all of the bonds

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,090
have $100 face value.

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,820
And all of these bonds are risk free.

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,020
So we are talking about spot interest rates, risk-free spot

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,010
interest rates.

29
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,420
So this is for bond A.

30
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,610
The next step is to write the price

31
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,240
as the function of the coupon and interest rates for bond B.

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,210
So Bond B has two years until maturity and pays 3% coupon.

33
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,150
This means that if we are the holder of this bond

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,950
we will get $3 at the end of year one, which

35
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,480
is our first coupon.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,540
We'll get $3 at the end of year two, which

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,950
is our second coupon.

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,920
And then we will get the face value of $100 paid

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,650
to us at the end of year two.

40
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,310
So now what we do is we're discounting these coupon

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,510
payments and the face value to present using

42
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,220
the appropriate discount rates.

43
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,690
So the first $3 we get at the end of Year 1.

44
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,830
So therefore we're discounting it by discount rate r1.

45
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,080
And the second payment, the last coupon in the face value,

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,050
we're getting at the end of Year 2.

47
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,720
And therefore, we're discounting it to present.

48
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,680
We're using r2 as the discount rate.

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,430
Hence power of 2 here because this payment

50
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,460
comes at the end of Year 2.

51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,190
The final step is to do the same thing for Bond C.

52
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,280
So the price of Bond C, this bond has three years

53
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,430
until maturity, base coupon 3.5%, so 3.5 dollars

54
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,660
discounted by 1 plus r1.

55
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,620
So this is our first payment.

56
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,060
Our second payment is the next coupon $3.50 discounted

57
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,790
to present at discount rate r2 raised to the power of 2

58
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,760
because this payment occurs in Year 2.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,680
And finally we get our last coupon

60
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,560
at the end of year three.

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,082
We get face value of this bond as well at the end Year 3.

62
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:21,540
And we're discounting it to present

63
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,932
using r3 as a discount rate.

64
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,390
And we're raising it the power of 3

65
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,630
because this payment occurs at the end of Year 3.

66
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:34,840
Now the goal is to find spot interest rates r1, r2, and r3.

67
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,350
I've written down the prices of these bonds right here.

68
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,430
So they are given to us.

69
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,830
So what we effectively have here is

70
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,910
that we have a system of three equations with three unknowns.

71
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,730
And notice that this is an easy system to solve in the sense

72
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,540
that the first equation has only one unknown, r1.

73
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,320
So we can solve this equation, plug this r1

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,560
into the second equation, at which point

75
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,570
this ratio will become known.

76
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,290
And this will just become an equation with one unknown, r2.

77
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,460
At which point we can solve this equation for r2,

78
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,540
plug our known r1 and r2 into the last equation,

79
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,950
and solve this last equation for r3.

80
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,950
And so this is exactly what I'm going to do now.

81
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,270
So I'm going to start solving the first equation for r1.

82
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:33,440
So r1 is going to be equal to $100 divided by $97.50 minus 1.

83
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,630
So this would give me the first spot interest rate, r1.

84
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,630
So I solved this first equation for the first spot interest

85
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,980
rate, r1.

86
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,210
And the answer is r1 equals to 2.56%.

87
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,640
Now the next step is to take this known r1

88
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,670
and put it into the second equation.

89
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,230
I've erased the third equation here right now so that I

90
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,750
have more space to work here.

91
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,760
So what I will do here is that I will plug this

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,612
into this equation.

93
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:05,820
And I will get the following.

94
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,770
So I'll get 96 equals to $3 divided by 1

95
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:27,430
plus 2.56% plus 103 divided by 1 plus r2 raised to power of 2.

96
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,060
This is a known number that we can compute.

97
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,770
And so this just becomes an equation

98
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,020
with one unknown, which I can solve for r2.

99
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,480


100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,550
I just solved this equation for r2.

101
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,490
So r2 equals to 5.2%.

102
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,220
Now the last step is to find r3.

103
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,440
So I've written down back the bond pricing

104
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,183
equation that we had before for Bond C.

105
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:55,600
And so right now what I will do is

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,690
that I will take again r1 that we computed before

107
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,710
and I will put it down here.

108
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,880
And I will also do the new r2 that we found.

109
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,340
And I'll put it into this last equation

110
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,640
as well, at which point again this will become just one

111
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,480
equation with one unknown.

112
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,610
So let's do it.

113
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:31,570
So $98 equals to 3 and 1/2, 1 plus 2.56% plus another 3.5,

114
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:38,290
that's our second coupon, divided by 1 plus 5.2%

115
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:52,220
squared plus 103.5 Divided by 1 plus r3 raised to power of 3.

116
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,360
So this we can compute.

117
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,320
This we can compute.

118
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,610
And again, this just becomes one equation with one unknown.

119
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,920
So the goal right now is to solve this equation for r3.

120
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,380
So I just solved this equation for r3

121
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,700
and I found that r3 equals to 4.22%.

122
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,910
And that's how we find spot interest rates.

123
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,700
So r1 equals to 2.56%.

124
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,410
r2 equals to 5.2%.

125
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,560
And r3 equals to 4.22%.

126
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,880
This is the answer to this question.

127
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,630
So this is how we find from given bond prices.

128
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,760
This is how we find spot interest rates.

129
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,110
When we start with finding the closest or the shortest

130
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,660
interest rate from the first given bond and then

131
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,723
we continue working and finding the second

132
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:40,890
and the third interest rate.

133
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,240
So if we're given a fourth bond and we were given four periods,

134
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,880
we would continue doing that, and just solving this equation

135
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,720
and stripping these spot interest rates.

136
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,280
Now the last step what I will show

137
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,000
is that I want to actually use this discount rate

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,540
and make sure that I solve this question correctly in the sense

139
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,380
that if I were to price those bonds using this term

140
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,830
structure spot interest rates, that I would actually get

141
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,200
the prices that we were given.

142
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,560
And I will show this to you right now.

143
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,680
So let's compute the prices given the interest

144
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,010
rate that we just found.

145
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,680
So the price of Bond A would equal to,

146
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,320
again, it's a zero-coupon bond, one year to maturity.

147
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,150
So it's $100 divided by 1 plus r1.

148
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,750
So r1 right now equals to 2.56%.

149
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,640
So if we compute this price of this Bond A,

150
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,450
what we will find is that it equals to $97.50.

151
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,360
The price of Bond B would equal to the first coupon,

152
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,150
so $3 divided by 1 plus r1 which is

153
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:49,370
2.56% plus the last coupon plus the face value

154
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,690
divided by r2 which is 5.2% raised to the power of two

155
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,680
because this cash flow occurs at the end of Year 2.

156
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,560
So if we compute this price right now

157
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,310
with this interest rate, what we will find

158
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,970
is that the price of this bond is indeed

159
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,200
$96, the number that was given to us in this question.

160
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,360
Finally, the bond price C equals to the first coupon payment

161
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,610
3.5 dollars because this bond, again, has 3.5% coupon rate,

162
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,000
divided by 1 plus 2.56%.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,540
This is our r1.

164
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,670
Second coupon, $3.50 divided by 1 plus the second discount

165
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,420
rate, r2, Plus the last coupon payment,

166
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,810
3.5 plus the face value received at the end of Year 3

167
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,860
it's counted by 1 plus r3.

168
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,140
That's 4.22% raised to the power of 3

169
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,990
again because this cash flow occurs at the end of Year 3.

170
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,960
So if we compute this price, we will find

171
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,580
that it also equals to $98.

172
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,830
So what we've done, we've confirmed

173
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,360
that the discount rates that we've found from given bond

174
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,250
prices, if we plug them back in and try

175
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,300
to price those bonds with these discount rates,

176
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,930
it will, indeed, find the numbers or the bond prices that

177
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,050
were given in this question, which means that we have solved

178
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,530
this question correctly.
