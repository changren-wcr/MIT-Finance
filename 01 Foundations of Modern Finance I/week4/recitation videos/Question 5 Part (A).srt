00:00:00,952 --> 00:00:02,720
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,610
learn how to compute duration for different types of bonds.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,040
Assume that the yield curve is flat at 2%.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,550
Compute the Macaulay duration and modified duration

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,890
for the following bonds.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,790
Bond A is a zero-coupon $100 face value

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,850
bond maturing in 20 years.

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,280
Bond B is a 5% coupon, $100 face value perpetual bond.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,040
We will assume that the coupons are paid annually.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,740
And C is a 5% coupon bond with $100 face

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,000
value maturing in 20 years.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,630
We will also assume that the coupons are paid annually.

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,360


14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,530
Let's start with question a.

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,420
And compute the duration for a zero coupon bond

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,410
that matures in 20 years.

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,590
Let's start with Macaulay duration.

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,810
So by definition, Macaulay duration

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,700
is given by the following expression.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,670
So it's 1 divided by the price of the bond multiplied

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,490
by the sum where we take each of cash

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,200
flows that the bond pays in year, in years T and divide it

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,620
by 1 plus yield raised to the power of t multiplied

24
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,220
by the period in which this cash flow was paid, so year t.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,970


26
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,210
For zero-coupon bond, all of the cash

27
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,050
flows except for the very terminal cash flows are zero.

28
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,060
So in this case, cash flows in year small t,

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,600
where small t is equal or less than capital T would

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:52,400
be zero and cash flow in year cap T is $100.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,900
So therefore, the Macaulay duration expression,

32
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,290
the whole sum, would be just consisting of one term.

33
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,210
This is the terminal term.

34
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,900
So we get 1 over P multiplied by $100 divided

35
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,830
by 1 plus yield raised to the power of capital T multiplied

36
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,650
by capital T. So this is the terminal year

37
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,670
in which the only payment that this bond pays actually occurs.

38
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,500
So now, notice that the price of the bond for a zero-coupon bond

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,740
is given by just simply $100 divided by 1 plus yield raised

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,970
to the power of capital T. And so what I will do right now

41
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,750
is that I will plug in this price equation

42
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,790
into the duration equation.

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,640
And so you could see that, that would just

44
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:48,340
equal to 1 over P multiplied by P and multiplied by capital T.

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,350
And so that would just give us capital T.

46
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,940
So therefore for a zero-coupon bond,

47
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,710
the Macaulay duration would always

48
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,370
equal to the maturity of the bond.

49
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,160
And this is a very important property for zero-coupon bonds.

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,370
So in this particular case, since our bond

51
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,850
has 20 years to maturity, the Macaulay duration

52
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,000
for this bond in part A of this question equals to 20 years.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,610


54
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,410
Now the next step is to find the modified duration, which

55
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,480
by definition is the Macaulay duration divided

56
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,800
by 1 plus y, which is again yield to maturity on this bond.

57
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,620


58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,310
The modified duration of this bond

59
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,450
then is given simply by taking 20, which is the Macaulay

60
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,990
duration, divided by 1 plus 2%.

61
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:54,180
And this gives us 19.61%.

62
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,370
So to summarize, the Macaulay duration

63
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,000
for this bond is 20 and the modified duration is 19.61%.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
