1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,640
PROFESSOR: Let me show you how we can automate solving

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,890
this arbitrage question.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,860
The first step that I will do is I will write down

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,890
the system of equations that we had in the following matrix

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,520
form.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,160
So I'll have matrix A. This is a 4 by 4 matrix.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,430
Then, I will have a column vector of x's.

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,560
This is our unknowns, our positions

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,680
that we're taking in this corresponding box.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,320
And this would equal to the payoffs

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,570
that we get in years 0, 1, 2, and 3.

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,530
So you can see that this system of equations written

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,570
this way in the matrix form actually gives us

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,460
the system of equations that we had before.

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,760
Now, we have to solve this for A.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,945
So all we really have to do is that we have to invert matrix A

17
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:50,750
and then, multiply it by the payoffs vector--

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,020
vector b, in this case.

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,360
And let me show you how to do this using Excel tools.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,300
You can, of course, do it in any other software

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,310
that you are more accustomed to using.

22
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,280
So here, what I've done below is that I

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,070
have written down this system, these numbers,

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,070
into just Excel arrays.

25
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,980
And what I will do-- so this is my matrix A,

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,160
and this is my matrix B. So the goal right

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,950
now is to invert these highlighted cells,

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,150
and then multiply them by this vector b.

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,280
So the first, I will use minverse function that

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,160
inverts this 4 by 4 matrix.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,930
To do this, first I have to prehighlight the location

32
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,220
where I want these numbers to be inputted by Excel.

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:50,810
And then, I'm writing the function, so minverse.

34
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,850
And then, I'm selecting array, where this--

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,480
where I inputted these numbers.

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,360
And then, this is the-- the key here

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,370
is to hit the following three keys at the same time,

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,978
so I have hit Shift and Control.

39
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:06,770
So I'm holding Shift and Control right now,

40
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,630
and then I'm hitting Enter.

41
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,190
So this way right now, Excel--

42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,470
what's it's done, it inverted this matrix.

43
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,080
And so right now, what I have here on the screen

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,573
is that it's inverted matrix A.

45
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,990
So now, all I have to do is that I

46
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,730
have to multiply this inverted matrix by vector b.

47
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,650
So here, again, I will prehighlight

48
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,530
because I'm multiplying 4 by 4 matrix by vector 4 by 1.

49
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,560
So the resulting output would be 4 by 1 vector,

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,110
and this would be our vector of x's.

51
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,340
So I will use the following function, so mmult.

52
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,280
So this is a multiplication function that multiplies

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,620
two arrays of two matrices.

54
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,790
So select the first one, comma, and I will select vector b.

55
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,140
And now, I will also--

56
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,990
so I will hold Shift and Control.

57
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,710
And then, I will hit Enter.

58
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,760
And so this is the answer.

59
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,450
So I'm going to highlight it in yellow.

60
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,950
And you will see that this is exactly the numbers that we've

61
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,060
had before when we were solving this system of equations

62
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,540
by hand.

63
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,980
So again, we're taking long positions in bonds A, B, and C

64
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,480
and we're shorting.

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,280
We're selling bond D. So this is how

66
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,730
you solve the system of equations in Excel.

67
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,740
So overall, what we've learned in this question

68
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,280
is that we have learned how to tackle this type of arbitrage

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,173
problems.

70
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:38,590
So all we have to do is that we'll

71
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,110
have to assume that we're taking long positions

72
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,920
in the instruments that we have.

73
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,690
So here we have 4.

74
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,070
If we had 10, we would assume that we

75
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,760
are taking xa, xb, and so forth positions

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,830
in all of the 10 instruments.

77
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,560
And then, the keys to construct the payoffs that we get--

78
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,660
$100 in year 0--

79
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,725
and we get $0 payoffs in all of the subsequent years.

80
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:02,350
And then, what we have to do is that we

81
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,140
have to solve the system of equations,

82
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,960
as we've just done here.

83
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,650
And this way, we would know which positions

84
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,210
and which bonds to take in order to construct

85
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,910
a profitable trading strategy.
