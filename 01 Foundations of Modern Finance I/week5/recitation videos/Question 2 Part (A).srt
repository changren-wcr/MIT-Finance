1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,019
PROFESSOR: There is a company called Common App.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,830
It's a startup company that produces Common App.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,680
This company currently does not pay dividends.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,380
It's a startup company so it reinvests all of the earnings

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,510
back into its operations.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,250
But it is expected that this company is

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,100
going to start paying dividend in year five

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,070
and the expectation is that the dividend in year five

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,500
will be $1.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,570
After that it is expected that this dividend is

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,450
going to grow at the expected rate of 3%,

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,420
and this growth is going to continue into perpetuity,

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,440
in other words forever.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,560
We will assume that the appropriate discount

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,080
rate for the cash flows for the dividends from this stock

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,970
is 12%.

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,370
The question is, what is the current price

18
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,800
of a share of Common App?

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,630
Let's use Gordon growth model to compute the price of the stock.

20
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,950
First, I will put all the dividends on a timeline.

21
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,912
So recall that in the first four years

22
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:02,120
of the life of this company doesn't pay any dividends

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,703
because it's growing, it's reinvesting

24
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:06,278
all of its earnings, and starting in year five

25
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:07,570
it will start paying dividends.

26
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,100
So the first dividend will be $1.

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,350
From that point onwards the dividend

28
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,440
is going to grow at 3% rate.

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,680
So dividend in the year six for example,

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,230
is just $1 multiplied by 1 plus 3%.

31
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,800
I will do two steps in order to find the value of the stock

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,000
today.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,080
First I will compute the value of all of these dividends

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,240
that started in year five and continue

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,650
to perpetuity as of year four.

36
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,840
To do that I will simply use the growing perpetuity formula.

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,090
So in this case, the price of the stock in year four

38
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,410
is going to be equal to the dividend in the year five,

39
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,170
D5, divided by r minus g, g is the expected growth

40
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,180
rate in dividends, r is the discount rate.

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,470
So this is just a simple growing perpetuity.

42
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,660
So D1 equals to $1 and we're dividing it by 12 minus 3%,

43
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,990
this gives me $11.11.

44
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,250
So this is the price of the stock in year four.

45
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,040
Now to find the price of the stock right now,

46
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,760
we need to take the P4 and discount it to present.

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,340
So I'm simply taking P4 and I'm dividing it

48
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,900
by 1 plus r raised to the power four,

49
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,820
again, r is our discount rate, so 11.11,

50
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,990
divided by 1 plus 12%, raise to the power four,

51
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,760
this gives me the current price of $7.06.

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,010
So the current price of this Common App stock is $7.06.

53
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,000
