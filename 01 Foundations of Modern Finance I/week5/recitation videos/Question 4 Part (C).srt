00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,800
PROFESSOR: As an investor in the stock ABC,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,039
what is the expected return that you will

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,890
get from holding this stock?

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,480
Let's compute it using the dividend stream and the prices,

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,290
the expected the prices per share,

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,250
that we computed in this question.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,350
So let's start with this fundamental relationship

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,740
between the price today and the price

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,140
tomorrow plus the dividends that we get from holding

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,020
the stock discounted to today.

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,820
So what I will do right now is that I will

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,130
rearrange this equation for r.

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,050
This is our expected return.

14
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,980
So this is the first step, and this is the second step.

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,240
So the expected return equals to the dividend

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,660
that we expect to receive from the share tomorrow divided

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,140
by the price today plus price tomorrow minus price

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,660
today divided by price today.

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,470
So recall that this first part, D over p,

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,880
we referred to as dividend yield.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,440
And the second part, price tomorrow minus price today

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,870
divided by price today, this is what

23
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,380
we refer to as capital gains.

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,250
And I will use this relationship to compute the expected return

25
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,380
on the stock of ABC.

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,930
Let's start by computing expected return

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,920
that we will get between year zero and year one

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,200
from holding this stock.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,250
So it's next year's dividends divided by today's share

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,040
price-- so this is the dividend yield--

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,227
plus capital gain.

32
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:37,810
So this is the share price in the year

33
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,100
one minus the current share price divided

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,923
by the current share price, and this gives me 12%.

35
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:47,340
And I could just extend this array

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,270
and continue this calculation all the way to later years.

37
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,250
And we'll see that in every year,

38
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,080
it's just going to be 12%.

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,330
For example, in all of the subsequent years,

40
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,070
because the share price stays the same,

41
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,420
we only get dividends.

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,990
And the dividend yield in all of the subsequent years

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,790
is exactly 12%.

44
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,919
Now this, of course, should not surprise us

45
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,100
because the expected return is constant.

46
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,270
And it's 12%, and it actually equals the discount rate

47
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,240
that we used, which is the expected return on this stock.

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,045
So what we've done right now is that we are actually

49
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,420
doing this calculation backwards because we could've just

50
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,795
answered this question by saying,

51
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:29,680
well, we already know what is expected return

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,630
because we were discounting these cash

53
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,000
flows at the 12% rate.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,280
So the expected return has to be 12%.

55
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,200
But right now, we just computed this

56
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,520
by using the dividend yield and the capital gains

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,680
from the dividends and share prices

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,430
that we computed in this question.
