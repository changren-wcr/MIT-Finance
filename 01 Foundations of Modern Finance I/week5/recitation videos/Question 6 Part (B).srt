1
00:00:01,218 --> 00:00:03,010
PROFESSOR: Assume that the firm is planning

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,710
on making an investment which will improve profitability

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,540
of both divisions A and B. This project requires

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,320
an initial investment of $7 million right now

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,380
and will increase cash flow for both divisions by $0.5 million

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,200
starting in the year 3.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,760
This additional cash flow will grow

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,610
at the same rate as other cash flows

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,400
in each division, which means it will

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,160
grow at the rate of 3% in division A

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,460
and it will grow at 5% in division B.

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,740
Assume that the cost of capital for both divisions

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,740
is not affected by this project.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,090
If management decides to invest in this new technology,

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,255
by how much will the current market value of XYZ increase?

16
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:57,790


17
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,840
Well, let's compute the NPV of this project.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,930
The NPV of this project equals to the initial investment

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,630
that we have to make right now of $7 million

20
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,910
plus the new cash flow that this project will generate.

21
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,670
The first part of this equation is the present value

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,330
of the increase in the cash flows

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,142
that accrues to division A.

24
00:01:22,142 --> 00:01:25,870
In squared parentheses, we have $0.5 million.

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,650
This is the cash flow that will start in year 3.

26
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,720
And we're discounting it to present

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,180
by dividing it by 10% minus 3% because it's

28
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,350
a growing perpetuity.

29
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,630
This cash flow is going to grow at 3%,

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,810
and the discount rate here is 10%

31
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,205
because this is the risk of division A.

32
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,610
And since this cash flow starts in year 3,

33
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,760
by applying the growing perpetuity formula,

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,590
this gives us value in the year two.

35
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,230
So to find the present value, we're

36
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,400
discounting or dividing it by 1 plus 10% raised

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,500
to the power of 2.

38
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,900
I highlighted power of 2 here in different colors

39
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,229
so that we understand that the growing perpetuity formula

40
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,130
gives us the value in year two.

41
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,115
Similarly, for division B, the present value

42
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:17,740
of this additional cash flow is, again,

43
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,490
$0.5 million that accrues to division B.

44
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,780
And we're discounting it here at the cost of capital of division

45
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,790
B. And again, we're realizing that this cash flow of $0.5

46
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,810
million will grow in this division at 5% rate,

47
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,780
similarly to the growth rate in all of the other cash flow

48
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,123
as well.

49
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:41,290
So therefore, we have the growing perpetuity formula

50
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,018
in the squared parentheses.

51
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:44,560
And then, we're dividing it and we're

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,850
bringing it to present by, again,

53
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,770
using the appropriate cost of capital for division B.

54
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:59,960
Computing this net present value, we get $11.33 million.

55
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,250
So therefore, the new market value of firm XYZ

56
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,390
is $87 million--

57
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,830
what it was before--

58
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,080
plus the present value or the net

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,450
present value of this new investment project,

60
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,520
which is $11.33 million.

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:22,640
So this brings up the market value of XYZ to $98.33 million.

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,900
This is an increase of $11.33 divided by $87 million.

63
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,120
So this is an increase of 13.02%.

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,260
So by engaging in this investment project,

65
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,500
the management of the company increases its value by 13.02%.

66
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,000
