1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,230
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will consider a simple model

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,050
of investment and growth.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,460
Let me start by laying out main assumptions.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,090
First, assets don't depreciate.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,970
This means that, even without new investment

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,030
the current earnings, or more specifically earnings per share

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,110
is going to stay constant at the current level.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,640
Investment at time t starts generating earnings

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,960
in year t plus 1.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,670


11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:38,670
Investments generate perpetual earnings stream.

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,100
And finally, investment opportunities

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,450
are characterized by ROI, which is the Return On Investment.

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,360
Let me give you a very specific example of an investment

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,690
opportunity.

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,060
Suppose a firm invests $100 million

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:01,850
into a factory today in Year 0.

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,890
Let's say that the return on investments or ROI is 15%.

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,980
Then in the case of this firm, this investment

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,350
will start producing earnings in Year 1

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,060
and these earnings will continue forever.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,790
And these earnings will be $15 million

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,520
which you compute as the investment $100 million

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,090
multiplied by ROI, which is our return on investment.

25
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,980
So 100 multiply by 15%, this gives us $15 million.

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,100
And this is annual perpetual earnings

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,230
that this investment generates.

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,680


29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,410
Now let's work with the specific example.

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,970
We will consider a firm, let's call it ABC.

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,750
The profitability of ABC and its investment policy

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,370
are summarized in this table below.

33
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,310
The company is going to have, today, the book value

34
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,120
per share of $100.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,580
Next year, it is expected to generate

36
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,200
earnings per share of $20.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,440
And then the plow-back ratio, which

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,960
means the percentage of earnings per share

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,445
that the company retains and reinvests,

40
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:14,900
are given as follows.

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,850
So in Year 1, the company plans to retain 80% of earnings

42
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,760
and reinvest.

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,910
So that's our plow-back ratio.

44
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,830
In year 2 and 3, 50%.

45
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,630
And then they don't plan to retain any of the earnings.

46
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,180
They plan to pay them all out in the form of dividend.

47
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,600
And finally the last row indicates the return

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,260
on investments this company will generate on these new earnings.

49
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,690
So in Year 1, it's 20%, then 15%, then 10%.

50
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,160
And then it is going to continue at 10% forever.

51
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,220
We will assume that the appropriate discount

52
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,370
rate in this question is 12%.

53
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,920
Let's look at the relationship between the key variables.

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,890
I will denote by B sub t, the plow-back ratio

55
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,950
of the company in the year t.

56
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,520
Investment, as I denote here by I in the year t

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,440
would be the fraction of earnings per share

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,530
that we retain.

59
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,080
So this will be also investment per share.

60
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,010
So earnings per share multiplied by the plow-back ratio,

61
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,410
this will be our investments in the year t.

62
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,030
The next year's earnings per share, EPS and t plus 1,

63
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,880
would be this year's Earnings Per Share, EPS

64
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,620
in year t plus ROI, this is the profitability

65
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,480
of our investments multiplied by the amount that we reinvested,

66
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,070
I.

67
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,720
The book value per share will be the prior year's book

68
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,120
value per share plus this new investments

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,540
that we made this year.

70
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,610
And finally, dividends would be the part of EPS

71
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,420
that would be in retained so we pay it out to shareholders

72
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,590
in the form of dividend.

73
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,770
So more specifically it is EPS in year t multiplied

74
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,840
by 1 minus plow-back ratio b.

75
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,100
Recall that 1 minus b is the payout ratio that we sometimes

76
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,600
denote as small p.

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,329
This is the fraction of the EPS that we pay out

78
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,560
in the form of dividend.

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,640
Hence the name, the payout ratio.
