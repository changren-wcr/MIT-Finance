1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,900
PROFESSOR: iDoc is a health service company.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,830
It just paid dividends of $1.50.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,560
Over the next two years, iDoc is expected

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,500
to increase their dividends by 10% per year.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,470
After that, the expectation is that these dividends

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,830
will continue growing at 3% into perpetuity, so forever.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,620
We also know the appropriate discount rate for the dividends

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,650
of iDoc is 8%.

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,950
The first question asks us to find the share

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,970
price of iDoc right now.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,690
As the first step, let's put all of these dividends

12
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,450
on the timeline.

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,350
So the first dividends-- recall that iDoc just paid dividend

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,070
of $1.50, which means that in year one,

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,660
the dividend's going to be $1.50 times 1 plus 10%, right?

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,760
So between year zero and year one, it's going to grow by 10%.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Now, during the year two, it's going to grow by another 10%.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,310
So D2 is going to be equal to D1 multiplied by 1 plus 10%.

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,890
Since after that point--

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,310
so from year two until year three-- so this dividend,

21
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,920
the growth rate is going to come down from 10% to 3%.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,420
So from this point, the dividend-- so dividend 3--

23
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,550
is going to be equal to dividend 2,

24
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,460
so D2 multiplied by 1 plus 3%.

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,800
And now, from year three onwards,

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,390
this growth's going to continue at 3%.

27
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,750
So sometimes, this is referred to as a two-stage Gordon Growth

28
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,250
Model.

29
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,920
So we have the first growth stage,

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,110
where the dividends grow at 10%.

31
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,480
And then, we'll have the second stage where dividends

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,900
grow at a lower rate of 3%.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,050
This represents reality often quite well

34
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,040
because a lot of companies start at the high growth stage

35
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,940
when they're younger.

36
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,450
So in this case, this company grows at 10%.

37
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,090
And then, this growth slows down and becomes perpetual growth

38
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,590
rate.

39
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,009
So in this case, it is 3%.

40
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,180
When we deal with a multistage Gordon Growth Model,

41
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,450
the recipe to solve this question is as follows.

42
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,270
First, we will start at the terminal growth stage--

43
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,230
so in this case, the growth stage two.

44
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,610
What we'll do is that we'll find the share price at the start

45
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,190
of that terminal growth stage.

46
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,660
So we'll compute P2.

47
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,210
So P2 would equal to dividend that we'd get in year 3, so D3.

48
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,210
So again, this would be a next dividend share

49
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,740
price in the year 2.

50
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,230
So P2 is going to equal to D3 divided

51
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,700
by r minus this terminal growth rate, which is--

52
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,470
I'll denote here as g2.

53
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,080
So this is my 3%.

54
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,420
This is to differentiate this from the initial growth

55
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,280
rate of 10%.

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,300
And now, I can compute D3 and I can compute P2.

57
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,360
So D3 is going to be equal to--

58
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,850
recall that this is D2 multiplied by 1 plus 3%.

59
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,180
And we know that D2 is D1 multiplied by 1 plus 10%,

60
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,380
and D1 is initial $1.50 multiplied by 1 plus 10%.

61
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,960
So if we collect this altogether, so D3

62
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,960
would equal to initial 1.5 multiplied

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,100
by 1.1 multiplied by 1.1 one more

64
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,090
time and multiplied by 1.03.

65
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,030
So this will give me dividend in the year 3.

66
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,420
And so I'm dividing it by 8%, which is my discount

67
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,580
rate, minus this 3%.

68
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,740
This is the second growth stage growth rate.

69
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,140
So this gives me $37.39.

70
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,900
The final step in finding the current share price

71
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,970
in a two-stage growth model is to take the share price

72
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,990
at the start of the second and terminal growth stage, P2,

73
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,410
discounted to present, and take all of the dividends that

74
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,170
accrued to shareholders during the first growth stage

75
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,420
and discount them to present as well.

76
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,170
This together would give us the current share price.

77
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,290
In our case, this is the D1 discounted

78
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,190
to present plus D2 discounted to present plus P2, which

79
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,000
is the share price at the start of the second growth stage,

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,870
and discounted to present as well.

81
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,320
We know that D1 is the current dividends, $1.50,

82
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,970
multiplied by 1 plus 10%.

83
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,050
10% is our growth rate during the first stage.

84
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,700
D2 is the current dividend multiplied

85
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,930
by 1 plus 10% squared.

86
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,780
P2-- that we just computed as $37.39,

87
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,940
and we're discounting all of these cash

88
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,990
flows to present at the current discount rate of 8%.

89
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,780
This gives us the current share price of $35.14.

90
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,630
And this is how you find the current share price

91
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,560
in a two-stage growth model.
