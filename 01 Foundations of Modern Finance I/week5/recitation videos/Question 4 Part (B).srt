1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,800
PROFESSOR: Let's solve this question.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,420
And by solving this question, I mean finding the current share

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,050
price and understanding the dynamics of the key variables

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,500
here.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,130
So in this spreadsheet I put the information

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,660
that we're given in the question.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,900
And I would like to start computing and filling

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,150
in the blanks for all of the key variables that we have here.

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,800
Down at the bottom here, I've written the key equations.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,640
So let's start with investment.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,090
So by definition, investment in Year 1

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,670
would be the EPS multiplied by the plow-back ratio.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,800
So that's going to be $16.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,740
It does make sense because our EPS is 20.

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,450
We're retaining 80% of that.

16
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,490
So that's $16.

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,540
So our investments in Year 1 is $16.

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:58,370
Now we can compute EPS in Year 2 which would be EPS in Year 1

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:04,220
plus ROI in Year 1 which is 20%, multiplied

20
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,130
by the investment which is $16.

21
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,750
And so the earnings per share in Year 2 is going to be $23.20.

22
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:21,750
Now we can also compute the book value per share

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,030
in year one, which would be the prior book value per share

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,370
plus the investments that we made in Year 1.

25
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,190
And let's also compute the dividend, which

26
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,470
would be the earnings per share multiplied

27
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,650
by 1 minus the plow-back ratio.

28
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,576
So dividend in Year 1 is $4.

29
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:47,220
And now we can compute the same calculation.

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,350
So again investments in Year 2 will

31
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,090
be our new earnings per share multiplied

32
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,100
by the plow-back ratio.

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,190
So it's going to be $11.60.

34
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,450
Earnings per share is going to be $24.94, again computed

35
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,280
as the prior year's earnings per share

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,210
plus ROI multiplied by the investment.

37
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,280
Book value per share, again, is just

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,230
prior year's book value per share plus the new investment.

39
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,690
And the dividends, again, this is just

40
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,567
EPS multiplied by 1 minus plow-back ratio.

41
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,150
You can see that because in the Year 2

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,060
we are retaining half of the EPS.

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,620
And half of it we are paying out as dividends.

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,470
So of course, investment and dividends

45
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,010
are the same in in the Year 2.

46
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,530
And now all I can do is that I can just simply do this,

47
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,040
stretch all these arrays down.

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,240
And because we have these equations,

49
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,190
we will be able to compute the key variables going forward.

50
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,680
Now we could see that again.

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,130
So in Year 3 for example, where we retain half

52
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,060
and we pay out half of our EPS, so investment and dividend

53
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,733
is the same.

54
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,150
Then of course starting in Year 4,

55
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,170
because we don't retain any of the earnings,

56
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,940
the investment is 0.

57
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,740
And therefore, earnings per share

58
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,870
stays constant starting from Year 4 onwards.

59
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,830
And in fact, dividends equal earnings per share

60
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,665
starting from Year 4.

61
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:32,040
And it does make sense because we

62
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,460
don't retain any earnings we pay them all out in dividends.

63
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,670
And you could also see that because investment is 0

64
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,450
so our book value per share stays

65
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,390
constant forever after Year 3.

66
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,410
Now let's look at the relationship between the EPS

67
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,390
and ERT plus 1, and EPS and ERT, and understand

68
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,630
where this equation comes from.

69
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,280
So what I will do here right now is that I will actually

70
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,510
write down year by year earnings per share that

71
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,520
comes from the existing assets and from these new investments

72
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,560
that we're making.

73
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,630
So what I mean is that in Year 1, so there is Year 1 EPS.

74
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:24,140
So for example, if we have not invested anything at all,

75
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,920
our EPS would have stayed at $20 forever.

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,530
Because this is what was given to us.

77
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,570
And so this $20 is something that

78
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,730
is generated by the existing assets,

79
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,530
by the book value per share that we

80
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,150
had prior to making these new investments.

81
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,170
Now the remaining EPS comes from, again,

82
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,340
these new investments.

83
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,290
So in Year 2, we're getting additional earnings

84
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,600
per share from the $16 investments

85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,430
that we made in Year 1.

86
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,360
So here I will denote what this is.

87
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:13,840
And so this is just 20% multiplied by $16 investment.

88
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,770
And so, because we said that these investments are such that

89
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,460
they produce earnings per share in perpetuity.

90
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:32,320
So this $16 and 20% ROI on this investment produces $3.20.

91
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,690
And these earnings will continue in perpetuity.

92
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,640
So here I'm doing just 10 years, but they

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,350
will continue into perpetuity.

94
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:46,180
So similarly, in the Year 2, we invest $11.60 and our ROI is

95
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,680
15.

96
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,700
So starting from Year 2, the new additional EPS

97
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,880
that we get from that investment is just, again,

98
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,900
this ROI multiplied by the investment.

99
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,400


100
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,940
And again, by the same logic, this EPS will continue forever.

101
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,060
And the final investments here we're making in the Year 3

102
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,090
where we're investing $12.47.

103
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,940
And our ROI at that point is 10%.

104
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,340
So we're generating, we're starting generating

105
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,730
this new EPS in Year 4.

106
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,390
And this equals to the investment times ROI.

107
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:35,010


108
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,360
And again, this continues forever.

109
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,500
So what I've done in this last column

110
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,060
is that so here I'm going to add up all of these EPS.

111
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,730
So in the Year 1, or I'll just sum them all up,

112
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,740
and of course in Year 1 we just have the initial $20.

113
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,030
And then we're adding up all of the investments that our--

114
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,970
all of the earnings per share that our new investments

115
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,860
generate.

116
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,470
And we could, of course, see that the column that I just

117
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:15,260
computed here, and let me color it in red,

118
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,590
it's the same exact as the EPS that we've computed here

119
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,710
by using this expression.

120
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,960
You can see that this is just mechanically happens

121
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,570
because we're just--

122
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,160
once this investment generates the EPS of 3.20 in the first

123
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,860
year, in Year 2, we're continuing adding it up

124
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,580
because we are writing down those recursive relationship.

125
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,520
And so therefore this equation does make sense.

126
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,320
But this was just to illustrate that these new investments,

127
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,710
indeed, generate perpetual earnings.

128
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,210
And this is how we are computing the EPS in year t plus 1

129
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,400
and relating it to EPS in the year t.

130
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,830
And this equation is indeed giving us

131
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,740
the correct earnings per share given the assumptions

132
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,940
that we made in this model.

133
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,440
Finally, let us compute the share price.

134
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,710
We could see that starting from Year 4,

135
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,350
the dividends are constant.

136
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,320
And therefore from Year 4 onwards,

137
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,710
this is just a simple perpetuity.

138
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,780
So for example, we can start by finding the share

139
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,270
price in Year 9.

140
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,820
So I will take the dividends in Year 10

141
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,510
and I'll just divide it by r.

142
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,522
This is our discount rate.

143
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:34,980
Again, this is just because this is

144
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,480
a perpetuity and the current share price or share

145
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,570
price in the Year 9 is the present value

146
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,660
of all of the dividends the start from Year 10.

147
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,280
And because this is a perpetuity,

148
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,680
this is the value of share in the Year 9.

149
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,780
And then we can just backfill that all the way to Year 0

150
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,830
by doing this.

151
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,540
So for example, in Year 8, what would be the share price?

152
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,720
Well, the share price would be the dividends

153
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,130
that we get in Year 9 plus the share price

154
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:16,820
it will be in Year 9 discounted by one year to Year 8.

155
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,850
So I can just write down this fundamental relationship

156
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:27,260
between the price of one share in Year 8 and Year 9.

157
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,000
So of course, not surprisingly, it

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,550
has to be the same, because there was an alternative way,

159
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,510
we could have just written down the same perpetuity present

160
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,610
value formula and it will have given us the same answer.

161
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,410
So that all makes sense.

162
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,070
But what this allows me to do is that this just

163
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,760
allows me to stretch this array all the way to 0.

164
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,600
And this will automatically compute the share price for me.

165
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,780
Because again, what I'm doing is that in every year,

166
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,632
for example, in the Year 1, the way I'm comparing the share

167
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:59,090
price, I'm taking the dividend they

168
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,990
will get in Year 2 and the share price that will be in Year 2

169
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,030
and then I'm just discounting it to Year 1.

170
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,970
So because this is, again, fundamental relationship

171
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,740
that ties the price right now with the dividend and the price

172
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,110
next period discounted to the period

173
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,170
before, this has to be correct.

174
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,810
And so therefore the current share price of the stock

175
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,300
