1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,720
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will consider a constant growth

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,680
model.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,370
Let's take a firm, ABC.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,460
This firm is expected to produce earnings per share

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,910
in Year 1 that equals to $20.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,660
ABC's return on investment or ROI is 20%.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,790
And this ROI is expected to remain constant at this level

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,380
forever.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,540
Notice the difference between this question

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,870
and question 4 where ROI was not constant.

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,680
So for this particular firm ROI is currently 20%

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,890
and it is expected to be constant.

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,120
ABC's current payout ratio is 55%

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,710
and it is also expected to remain at that level forever.

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,420
The appropriate discount rate is 12%.

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,140
We will answer two questions.

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,710
First, we will derive the share price of the stock

18
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,110
and then we will derive its present value

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,060
of growth opportunities.

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,820
Let's follow the approach we have established in Question 4.

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,880
I have put EPS that we expect to get from this firm in Year

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,400
1, $20 earnings per share.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,850
Now I will put plowback ratio.

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,340
Recorded plowback ratio is 1 minus the payout ratio.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,840
So that means that we are plowing back 45% of EPS

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,060
in the Year 1.

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,610
And this plowback ratio remains constant forever.

28
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,200
ROI equals to 20%.

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:44,000
And again, this rate will remain constant forever.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,830
Now let's compute the investment as EPS times the plowback

31
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,960
ratio.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,345
The dividends is simply the EPS multiplied

33
00:01:56,345 --> 00:02:02,250
by 1 minus the plowback rate or the payout rate.

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,040


35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,620
And then EPS in the Year 2 will be

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:17,936
the prior year's EPS plus ROI multiplied by the investment.

37
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:21,750


38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,850
And so we can just trace these arrays all the way forward

39
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,900
and get these numbers.

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,850
So we'll get investments and we'll get dividends.

41
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,730
Now let's look at the dividend stream.

42
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,850
Unlike the previous question, Question 4,

43
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,280
where we've stopped plowing back and we've

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,180
started paying out all earnings per share

45
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,900
as dividends at some point, So here we

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,050
continue plowing back at a constant rate.

47
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,760
So in this case, dividends always seem to grow.

48
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,192
And they don't stop.

49
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:03,150
So this is the difference between this question

50
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,070
and the question that we had before.

51
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,070
Now let's compute dividend growth rate

52
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,020
and see at what rate dividends grow in this model.

53
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,830
So I'll compute the growth rate between the year 2 and 1.

54
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,850
So I'll take dividend in Year 2 minus the dividend in the Year

55
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,140
1.

56
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,440
And I'll divide it by the dividend in the Year 1.

57
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,440
And so this seems to be 9%.

58
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,870
And I can just extend this array to see

59
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,050
what is the dividend growth rate for the subsequent years.

60
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,500


61
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,140
And what we see here, very interestingly,

62
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,450
that the dividend growth rate seems to be constant and be

63
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,460
at the rate of 9%.

64
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,570
And I'm doing it only for the first 10 years.

65
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,877
But if we were to extend this all the way to Year 100,

66
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:56,960
we will actually find out that the dividend growth

67
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,240
rate remains at 9%.

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,570
And so this is a very interesting fact of this model

69
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,500
that constant-- there is constant growth

70
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,870
rate in dividends here.

71
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,330
Now let's see if we can analytically

72
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,500
derive the dividend growth rate in this model.

73
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,360
Let b be the plowback ratio.

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,990
And so then the dividends in year t

75
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,370
is 1 minus the plowback ratio, again the payout ratio,

76
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,400
at times earnings per share in that year t.

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,890
Similarly, next period's dividend is this.

78
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,540
So I colored b here in color red just

79
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,072
to denote that this b, the plowback ratio,

80
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:44,030
is not going to change.

81
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,660
It's going to be constant.

82
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,470
So this b here is the same in period t plus 1

83
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,520
and in period t.

84
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,590


85
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,620
Now recall that earnings per share in year t plus 1

86
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,000
equals to the prior period's earnings per share plus ROI

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,350
times investment.

88
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,560
So again, here ROI is constant.

89
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,940
So I deleted the subscript t from ROI.

90
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,070
And then investment, of course, is just

91
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,453
EPS times the plowback ratio.

92
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,245
And again, this plowback ratio is constant.

93
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:20,460


94
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,120
Then we can write down the EPS in the year

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,450
t plus 1 as EPS in year t multiplied by

96
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,450
1 plus ROI times b.

97
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,650
And now we can plug this in to our dividend equation

98
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:40,800
for year t plus 1 which would be 1 minus the plowback

99
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,690
ratio times EPS in year t multiplied by 1 plus ROI times

100
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,280
b.

101
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,370
And now we can actually compute the dividend growth

102
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,170
rate, which is dt plus 1 minus dt divided by dt.

103
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,920
And I will express that as Dt plus 1 divided by dt minus 1.

104
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,300
And now into this equation, I will plug in our expressions

105
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,100
for dt plus 1 and dt.

106
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,540
So we just derived what was the Dt plus 1.

107
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,520
So it's 1 minus b multiplied by EPS in year t multiplied

108
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,580
by 1 plus ROI times b.

109
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,940
And dt is just 1 minus b times EPS in year t.

110
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,660
So you could see that 1 minus b and EPS cancels out.

111
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,170
Then what we have is just 1 plus ROI times b minus 1,

112
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,780
which is just ROI times b.

113
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,050
So in this model as long as the firm

114
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:44,920
maintains constant plowback ratio and has constant ROI,

115
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,970
the dividend growth rate will be time independent.

116
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,170
So it will be constant.

117
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,050
And it will be the product of the return

118
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,880
on investment this firm has and the plowback ratio.

119
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,760
And that's a very important equation that we just derived.

120
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,980
Now going back to our spreadsheet,

121
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,480
it should not surprise us right now

122
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,370
that the dividend growth rate here is 9% and it is constant.

123
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,590
Indeed, if I were to compute it just given

124
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,802
the payout ratio and ROI is just simply

125
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:19,030
the plowback ratio which is 1 minus the payout

126
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,830
ratio multiplied by ROI.

127
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,140
And so indeed is just 9%.

128
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,740
And this growth rate will remain constant,

129
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,510
as we just analytically showed.

130
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,600
And so then just to find the current share price,

131
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,520
realizing the dividends here grow at a constant rate, 9%,

132
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,070
and this will be a perpetual constant growth rate as long

133
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,650
as, again, the plowback ratio and ROI stay constant,

134
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,570
so all we need to do to find the current share

135
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,260
price because it's the growing perpetuity so we're taking

136
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,850
the dividend that we get in year one

137
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,010
and we're dividing it by r which is our discount rate 12 percent

138
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,040
minus the dividend growth rate of 9%.

139
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,250
And so the current share price of the stock is $366.67.

140
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,000
