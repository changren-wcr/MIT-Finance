00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,030
PROFESSOR: The second part of the question

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,900
asks us to find share price of iDoc in the Year 1.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,990
To help us solve this problem, I will put everything

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,330
on the timeline again.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,910
So dividend 2 is going to be equal

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,467
to a 1.5 times 1.1 squared.

7
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:21,550
And we already computed the share price in Year 2.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,500
So the share price in Year 2 is 37.39.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,380
So to find the share price in Year 1, all we need to do

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,220
is that we need to take this payments in Year 2

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,140
that would get as stockholders and to discount them to Year 1.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,820
So we're taking D2 plus P2 and we're dividing it by 1 plus r.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,680
And this would give us P1.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,920
So putting this all together, we get 1.5 times 1.1 squared.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,950
So this is D2 plus 37.39 this is the share price in Year 2,

16
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,650
and we're dividing it by 1 plus 8%.

17
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,270
This gives us $36.30.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,910
So the share price in the year one would be $36.30.

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,060
Now again, let me re-emphasize that this is ex-dividend

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,090
share price.

21
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,150
So it does not take into account the dividend

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,310
that this company iDoc is expected to pay in the Year 1.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,440
So this is ex-dividend price in the Year 1.

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,970
And you can see that we are only counting Dividend 2

25
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,150
and the share price in Year 2.

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,180
So P1 equals to 36.30.

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,020
Let me show an alternative way of solving this question.

28
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,960
Let's start with the fundamental equation

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,640
that ties the share price today with the share price in Year 1.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,190
So the share price today must equal to the dividend

31
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,070
that we get in the Year 1 plus the share price in Year 1

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,920
discounted to present, so divided by 1 plus r.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,610
If we rearrange this equation for P1,

34
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,760
so P1 is going to equal to P0 multiplied

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,403
by 1 plus r minus Dividend 1.

36
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:02,320
So we can use this equation because we already

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,562
found the current share price of P0

38
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:07,020
in the first part of this question.

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,350
So I will take this P0 that we before,

40
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,890
so 35.14, multiplied by 1 plus r.

41
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,470
So recall again that r is 8%.

42
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,250
And minus the Dividend 1 that we expect to receive in Year 1.

43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,280
So this is 1.5 multiplied by 1.1.

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,940
So computing this value gives us $36.30.

45
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,505
And so this is exactly the same value

46
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:35,220
as we've got in here by just computing the share price as--

47
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,920
share price in Year 1 as discounted

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,320
some of the dividend in Year 2 plus the share price

49
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,380
and Dividend 2 discounted to Year 1.

50
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,650
So either this way or this way, we've got exactly the same

51
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,490
share price of 36.30.

52
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,000
