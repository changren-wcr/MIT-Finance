00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:02,390
PROFESSOR: In this question, we'll

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,300
consider a firm that has multiple divisions

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,270
and we will see how investments affect

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,430
the market value of the firm.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,480
Consider Firm XYZ that has two lines of business,

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,310
organized as divisions A and B. Both of these divisions

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,720
are risky and generate risky cash flows.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,630
Division A expects to generate a cash flow of $2 million

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,090
next year, and this cash flow will

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,830
grow at a rate of 3% each year forever.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,620
Division B expects to generate a cash flow of $2 million

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,790
next year as well, but the cash flow from this division

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,670
will grow at 5% forever.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,800
So division B has a higher growth rate compared

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,010
to division A. Currently, the total market value of XYZ

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,130
is $87 million.

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,680
The cost of capital for the first line of business is 10%.

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,390
The first question asks, what is the cost

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,345
of capital for the second line of business?

20
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:08,220
This by itself is a very interesting question

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,450
because it makes us realize that divisions in a firm

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,290
can be different and they may have different business risk,

23
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,930
as we discussed early in the class.

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,360
And so therefore, for this particular firm,

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,140
division A has a level of risk that corresponds

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,570
to the 10% cost of capital.

27
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,820
But division B may have a different cost

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,630
of capital, which this question asks us to compute.

29
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,030
So let's compute it.

30
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,920
Let's first start with this equation

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,380
that tells us that the value of the firm

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,995
has to be equal to the sum of the value of the two divisions.

33
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:47,120
So these are market values.

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,870


35
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:56,280
Now, each division produces a perpetual cash flow that

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,080
has a constant growth rate.

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,000
So it can compute the value of each division

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
as just simply the present value of growing perpetuity.

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,430
So both of these divisions next year

40
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,180
will produce a cash flow of $2 million.

41
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,020
And we know the discount rate for the first division, 10%,

42
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,330
minus the growth rate of 3%.

43
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,050
This would be the present value of the cash flow

44
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,792
that is generated by the first division.

45
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:24,000
We have the similar equation for the second division,

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,250
$2 divided by rb minus 5.

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,040
So 5 is the growth rate for the second division.

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,360
And rb is the discount rate, which we actually don't know.

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,640
But we know that the market value of this firm right

50
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,740
now is $87 million.

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,418
So therefore, we have this equation.

52
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:42,960
And it looks like there is only one unknown in this equation,

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,440
so we can solve it for rb, which is, again, the discount

54
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,600
rate for division B.

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,210
Solving this equation gives us rb of 8.42%.

56
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,490
So this means that the second division is

57
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,020
less risky than the first one.

58
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,600
And therefore, its cost of capital

59
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,900
is lower than the cost of capital of division A, which

60
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,500
was, again, 10%.

61
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,000
