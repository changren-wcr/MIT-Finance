1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,970
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,470
start with the basics of the dividend discount model.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,330
Supposed that now is year zero.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,850
There is a firm called ABC and it is expected to pay $2.50

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,900
dividend per share in next year or in Year 1.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,750
In the Year 2, you expect this dividend to remain at the same

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,420
level or at $2.50.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,427
You also expect that ABC stock price will be $35 in Year 2.

9
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:31,260
We will assume that the appropriate discount

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,820
rate for the stock is 10%.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,340
The first question asks, what price

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,860
would you be willing to pay for a share of ABC stock

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,170
today if you planned to hold the stock for two years?

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,200
Question b, suppose instead you plan

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,210
to hold the stock for one year.

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,400
What price would you expect to be

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,650
able to sell a share of ABC stock for in one year?

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,000
And finally, question c, given the answer in part b,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,120
what price would you be willing to pay for a share of ABC stock

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,280
today if you planned to hold the stock for one year?

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,770
And then we will compare this answer

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,320
to the one we've got in part a.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,770
So let's start with the first, with part a.

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,230
It'd be useful to draw just a timeline for us

25
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,230
to visualize what we'd get by buying this stock.

26
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,207
So we're paying the current price or P0 right now.

27
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:33,040
And then by holding the stock for two years,

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,550
we get the following thing.

29
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,750
So we get dividend, the first dividend at the end of Year 1.

30
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,750
Again so here we're just assuming that the stock

31
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,390
pays annual dividends.

32
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,690
Then we also get dividend at the end of Year 2.

33
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,670
And then we sell the stock at the price at the end of Year 2

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,350
at P2.

35
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,560
So therefore to find the current price of the stock P0,

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,170
we just have to discount the two cash flows that we

37
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,900
get in Year 1 and 2 to present.

38
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,310
And so let us do that.

39
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,310
So this is the equation.

40
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,750
So P0 would equal to D1 divided by 1 plus r plus D2 plus P2

41
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,290
divided by 1 plus r squared.

42
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,650
We can put the numbers in.

43
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,560
So we get $2.50 first dividend.

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,440
We also get $2.50, the second dividend.

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,560
And we expect that the price at the end of Year 2

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,380
is going to be $35.

47
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,000
We are given the discount rate, which is 10%.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,100
So all we have to do is to compute this value right now.

49
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,590
So the current price will be $33.26.

50
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,040
Now let's turn to part b, suppose

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,480
that instead you plan to hold a stock only for one year.

52
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,660
For how much you expect to be able to sell it in one year?

53
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,360
So the question asks us what is our expectation, what would

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,302
be the stock price in Year 1.

55
00:02:58,302 --> 00:02:59,760
Well, we have a certain expectation

56
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,200
for the dividend in Year 2 and for the price in Year 2.

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,450
So for us to estimate what would be the price in Year 1,

58
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,250
we're taking the cash flows that we

59
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,150
get from the stock in the Year 2 so this is the second dividend

60
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,210
and the price in Year 2.

61
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,800
And we would discount it to Year 1.

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,320
So we're taking D2 plus P2 and dividing it by 1 plus 10%.

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,290
If you put the numbers in, it tells us

64
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,810
that the stock price in the Year 1,

65
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,030
or our expectation of how much we can sell, it,

66
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,680
will be $34.09.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,270
Now finally, let's turn to part c of this question.

68
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,190
So given our answer in part b right now,

69
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,780
so given the price P1 that we just computed,

70
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,640
what would be the price that you're

71
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,350
willing to pay for a share of this stock today?

72
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:58,470
If you again expect to be able to sell it in the Year 1 at P1?

73
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,390
Well, then from this perspective,

74
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,570
from this perspective of a one-year investor,

75
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,940
the current price should be just the cash flow

76
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,740
that you get from the stock in Year 1.

77
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,830
So it's your first dividend 2.50 plus P1.

78
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,040
So this is for how much you're expecting

79
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,899
to be able to sell this stock discounted to present.

80
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,570
So D1 plus P1 divided by 1 plus r.

81
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,400
Again, r here is 10% And so if we put the numbers in we get

82
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,220
$2.50 plus $34.09.

83
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,970
So this is the P1 that we computed in part

84
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,880
b, divided by 1 plus 10%.

85
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,750
And this gives us $33.26.

86
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,290
So in fact, in part a of this question and in part c,

87
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,890
we got exactly the same answer.

88
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,270
So it's $33.26.

89
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,340
We have demonstrated that the current price

90
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,630
P0, that the one-year investor and the two-year investor

91
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,400
willing to pay for this stock is the same.

92
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,460
This is because the one-year investor also

93
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,940
cares about the dividend and price in Year 2.

94
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,140
Because these determine the price at which

95
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,940
she can sell the stock at the end of Year 1

96
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,940
to an investor with similar beliefs.

97
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,060
Now this last bit is very important.

98
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,566
These two investors must have similar beliefs.

99
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:24,360
If they don't, for example they differ

100
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,830
in their expectation what would be

101
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,280
the price of the stock in a Year 2,

102
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,050
then of course they would disagree

103
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,210
about the current stock price.

104
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,860
Therefore, the very important lesson

105
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,040
that this question demonstrates is that disagreements in value

106
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,070
are due to difference in beliefs and not

107
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,140
in the investment horizon.

108
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,500
Because if these two investors have exactly the same beliefs

109
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,070
about the future dividends and the future prices of the stock,

110
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,820
they will assign exactly the same value today

111
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,050
regardless of the investment horizon.
