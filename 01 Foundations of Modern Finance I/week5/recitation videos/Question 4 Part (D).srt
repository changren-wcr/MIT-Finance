1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
PROFESSOR: Let's compute the present value

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,975
of growth opportunities of this firm ABC.

3
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:08,600
Recall that we define the present value

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,835
of growth opportunities as the current price.

5
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:12,210
So this is the price that we just

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,020
computed in this question given our investment opportunities

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,220
and our investment policy minus what would have happened

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,370
if we didn't invest and we just continued status quo

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,680
from year 1 onwards.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,930
So if we haven't invested anything

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,260
and we paid out all of our earnings

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,420
starting from Year 1 as dividends,

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,220
our earnings per share would have stayed

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,580
constant at $20 level forever.

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,890
And this would have been our dividends.

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,480
So our dividends per share would have

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,420
been $20 starting from Year 1 and continuing onwards.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,460
So therefore, the present value without growth

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,660
or without us investing in these new opportunities

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,460
would have been just EPS in Year 1 divided by r.

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,450
So that's the present value of this perpetuity.

22
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,780
So in our case, this is $117.02.

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,210
So this is the price with our current investment

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:18,220
policy minus 20 divided by 12% and this gives us $10.36.

25
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,430
So the current value of ABC's growth opportunities,

26
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,550
of course on a per share basis because this whole calculation

27
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,230
on a per share basis, is $10.36.

28
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,230
In other words, each shareholder here

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:39,530
benefits by increasing his or her share price by $10.36

30
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,400
from this investment policy that this firm undertakes.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,310
Now let us do a very interesting counterfactual analysis here.

32
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:55,730
What happens if we did not retain any earnings in Year 3

33
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:01,370
and we would have paid out the entire EPS in Year 3

34
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,050
as dividends?

35
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,000
In other words, what if this number that I

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,060
colored in green right now, instead of being 50%

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,949
would have been 0%?

38
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,265
What would have happened to our share price?

39
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:15,240
Would it increase?

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,320
Would it stay the same?

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,110
Or would it decrease?

42
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,850
The answer depends on, of course,

43
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,350
what is the return on investment that our new investments

44
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,050
generate in this particular year.

45
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,460
And in this case, this is 10%.

46
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,100


47
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,820
Remember that we're discounting our cash flows at 12%

48
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,790
and this is the expected return, this is the risk

49
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,180
that our investors associate with the cash

50
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,800
flows that this company generates.

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,410
So therefore, if we are only earning 10% on our investments,

52
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,980
this is below the level of risk that

53
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,480
is assessed by our investors.

54
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,280
So it stands to reason that we are losing value

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,980
by investing in projects that generate

56
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,190
the return on investment that is below the expected

57
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,640
return on this stock.

58
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,208
And so in fact if I put 0 here again.

59
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,500
So this would just indicate that instead of reinvesting

60
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,880
we're just paying everything out to shareholders,

61
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,710
we could see that our share price actual increases.

62
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,025
If I put 0 here instead of 177.02,

63
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:25,870
our current share price would be 178.50.

64
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,780
And then, of course, if we do the same the year before.

65
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,010
So we've reinvested 50% in Year 2

66
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,280
But are ROI is actually very good.

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,620
It's 15% relative to the expected return of 12%.

68
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,330
So if I put 0 here, now of course the share price

69
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,620
has to drop because we're not investing in very attractive

70
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,820
investment opportunities.

71
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,780
So let's see what happens if it put 0% here, the share price

72
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,510
drops to $176.19.

73
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,450
To summarize, the optimal investment policy

74
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,970
is to invest in investment opportunities that

75
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,940
have a return on investment or ROI

76
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,480
that is above the expected return of the discount rate

77
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,180
that we're using to discount dividends from this stock.
