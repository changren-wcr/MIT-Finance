1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,430
PROFESSOR: Let's compute the present value

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,750
of growth opportunities of this company ABC.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,940
Let's first develop intuition.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,780
Recall that our ROI is 20%, so all our investments

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,890
generate perpetual return of 20%.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,070
And the discount rate for the dividends of the stock

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,160
is 12%, which means the expected return is

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,800
12% is lower than the return on investment

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,900
that this firm generates.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,700
So therefore, we should be expecting

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,440
that this company has positive present value of growth

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,870
options.

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,740
And so let's compute it.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,505
We will do exactly the same calculation

15
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:45,130
as we've done in the previous question.

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,290
So I will take first and compute the no growth share price.

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,390
So if this firm would not blow back any of the earnings,

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,210
starting in year one and starting paying them out

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,420
as dividends in year one.

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,810
In this case, the dividend level and EPS

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,650
would continue staying at 20% per share.

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,910
And therefore, the no growth share price

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,470
is going to be just simply 20 divided by 12%.

24
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,590
Because it's just going to be a regular perpetuity

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,640
of 20% of $20 forever.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,580
And so this is no growth share price.

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,540
And so the present value of growth options by definition

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,600
is the current share price minus no growth share price.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,190
And so in this case it's going to be $200.

30
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,610
You could see that this is the company that

31
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,110
derives a lot of its current share

32
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,570
price, a lot of its current market value

33
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,790
from these growth opportunities.

34
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,800
And indeed it should again make sense

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,390
because their return investment is very high, it's 20%.

36
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,020
So in fact we can compute what fraction of the current share

37
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,020
price comes from these growth opportunities, which

38
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,860
is then doing this calculation.

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,640
So taking the present value growth options

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,820
and dividing it by the share price.

41
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,650
And we can say that almost 55% of this stock price

42
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,640
is derived from the future growth opportunities.

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,690
And the remaining 45% come from the existing assets.

44
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,840
We can also check to see what happens if ROI would

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,180
have been lower and not 20%.

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,470
For example, if ROI instead would had been 15%,

47
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,940
we would intuitively expect that the present value

48
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,590
of growth options of this company would have been lower.

49
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,140
And therefore, the fraction of share price

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,030
that is attributable to growth options

51
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,330
would have been lower as well.

52
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,730
So let's try doing that.

53
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,780
To put 15% here, we see that the presence of our growth options

54
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,990
and the fraction of those growth options in the share price

55
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,690
drops to 20%.

56
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,630
And of course, if ROI would be 12%, which

57
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,420
would have been the same as the cost of capital

58
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,540
for this company, the discount rate that we're using, 12%.

59
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,270
In this case, intuitively, the presence of our growth options

60
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,560
should have been 0.

61
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,880
And so if I hit Enter, it indeed shows me that PVGO is 0

62
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,060
and the share price is the same as it

63
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,980
would have been if this company did not

64
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,480
log back any of its earnings.
