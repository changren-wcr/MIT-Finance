1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,520
PROFESSOR: Now to practice, let me show you an alternative way

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,760
of solving this problem.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,940
Let me first start computing the share

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,180
price as growing perpetuity, again, using Gordon growth

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,480
discount model, but starting from dividends that we

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,510
get from year six onwards.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,310
So what I will do is that I will find

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,960
the share price in year five as dividend 6 divided

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,070
by r minus g.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,760
So this is the value.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,730
This is the share price ex-dividend

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,770
at point in time five that captures

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,540
the value of all of the dividends

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,140
that start in year six and continue forever.

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,530
So recall that D6 is $1 multiplied by 1

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,910
plus 3% percent.

17
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,150
So it is dividing that by r minus g.

18
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,240
So this gives me the share price of this stock

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,430
in year five of $11.44.

20
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,540
Now, to find the current price of the stock, what I will do

21
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,020
is that I will take the share price in year five,

22
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,858
plus I will add the dividend that we get in year five.

23
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,150
Recall-- and this is important.

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,820
Recall that share price in year five,

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,500
the way we're computing it here, it's

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,250
an ex-dividend share price.

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,910
So it does not take into account the dividend

28
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,960
it received in year five.

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,330
So this value only counts dividends

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,018
starting from year six onwards.

31
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:25,060
So therefore, to compute the current share price,

32
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,493
I'm taking the ex-dividend price in year five,

33
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:30,910
I'm adding the dividend that I will receive in year five--

34
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,290
this is $1--

35
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,330
and I'm discounting all of this to present.

36
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,570
So D5 plus P5 divided by 1 plus r, raised to the power of 5.

37
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,140
So this gives me $1 plus $11.44--

38
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,780
again, this is the share price in year five--

39
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,150
divided by 1 plus 12%, raised the power of 5.

40
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,650
And this gives me $7.06.

41
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,700
So unsurprisingly, we've got exactly the same answer

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,433
as we've gotten before.

43
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,850
This is just to illustrate that as long as you're doing it

44
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,210
consistently, you can have, potentially,

45
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,300
multiple ways of solving the same problem that gives you

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,620
exactly the same answer.

47
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,200
Again, the key is to make sure that you're counting

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,500
all dividends properly.

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,000
