1
00:00:00,786 --> 00:00:03,940
PROFESSOR: We now apply our discounted cash flow formula

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,060
to develop a canonical relation model for stocks.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,040
This is the Gordon model.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,550
The Gordon model is also known as the constant growth model.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,800
And it's based on two key assumptions.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,460
First, we assume that the discount rate, or the expected

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,160
return on the stock, is constant across periods.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,270
Second, we assume that the growth rate of dividends,

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,570
in expectation, is constant as well.

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,300
Dividends grow at the average rate

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,130
equal to g, which exceeds the discount rate r.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,240
They grow at the same rate in perpetuity.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,680
With these two assumptions, we can

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,950
derive the value of the firm at time 0

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,740
over the price of the stock in relation

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,420
to the initial dividends.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,320
If we substitute into our discounted cash flow

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,160
formula the relation between dividends across time, where

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,440
a dividend at time t plus 1 is expected

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,190
to be equal to the dividend at time t times 1

21
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,940
plus the growth rate, we can see that we are dealing

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,260
with a growing perpetuity.

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,220
And the value, the present value of this growing perpetuity,

24
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,540
is equal to the expected cash flow at time 1,

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,340
D1, divided by r, the discount rate, minus g, the growth rate.

26
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,290
This is the Gordon model.

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,410
P0, the price of the stock, is equal to D1

28
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,230
divided by r minus g.

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,130
Let's look at an example.

30
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,810
Suppose that the current dividend on the stock is 1.

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,550
This is D0 equal to $1.

32
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,930
We expect dividends to grow at a 6% rate per year forever.

33
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,240
So g is equal to 6%.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,880
The expected return on this stock is 20%.

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,530
So r is 0.2.

36
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,770
In this case, the dividend at time 1, D1,

37
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,420
is expected to be equal to 1, initial dividend, times 1

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,110
plus the growth rate.

39
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,770
So that's $1.06.

40
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,350
And the price of the stock is therefore

41
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,670
$1.06 divided by the difference between the expected return

42
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,970
and the growth rate, which is 0.2 minus 0.06,

43
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,410
which gives us $7.57.

44
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,350
We can use this formula as a relation between prices

45
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,310
of securities, their expected dividends, expected returns,

46
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,320
and growth rates of dividends.

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,830
The Gordon model, the constant growth model,

48
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,550
relates the price dividend ratio to expected returns and growth

49
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,750
rates.

50
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,010
We can apply it in various ways.

51
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,830
For example, we can look at market prices

52
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,390
and infer what the market expects future returns to be

53
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,430
or what the projected growth rates for dividends are.

54
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,190
As an example, let's consider a situation

55
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,760
where we're using valuation ratios to forecast future stock

56
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,350
returns.

57
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,350
Northern company is a utility firm.

58
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,170
Its dividends are going to grow, in expectation,

59
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,610
at a constant rate forever.

60
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,640
A utility firm, being a stable business,

61
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,150
is a good candidate for applying this kind of constant growth

62
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,010
model.

63
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,000
The current dividend price ratio,

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,710
which is also called dividend yield, D0 over P0,

65
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,770
is equal to 4%.

66
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,190
Analysts are forecasting the long run growth of dividends

67
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,610
to be 5% per year.

68
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,660
Based on the Gordon model, we can express the expected stock

69
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:42,020
return in terms of the ratio of D1 to P0 and the growth rate.

70
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,500
Specifically, expected stock return

71
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,120
is equal to D1 over P0 plus g, the growth rate of dividends.

72
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,110
Because D1 is proportional to D0,

73
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,990
we can replace D1 with D0 times 1 plus g, the growth rate.

74
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,190
As a result, we can compute the expected return on the stock.

75
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,930
It's equal to 1.05 times the dividend yield

76
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,100
of 4% plus the 5% growth rate.

77
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,640
It's 9.2%.

78
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,190


79
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,529
One thing to note is the relation

80
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,709
between expected returns, and dividend yield,

81
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,240
and dividend growth.

82
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,360
What we see is that the expected return on the stock

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,840
is based on the growth rate of dividends and the dividend

84
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,122
yield.

85
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:33,580
In the second example, we are going

86
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,470
to forecast firm growth rate.

87
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,620
The company here is Kendall Square Cuisine.

88
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,960
It's a new health food franchise.

89
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,730
For those of you who don't know, MIT

90
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,170
is located in Kendall Square.

91
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,280
This company owns 10 restaurants as of now.

92
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,720
And each of these restaurants is expected to generate $1 million

93
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,770
in profits every year forever, in perpetuity.

94
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,400
This company, KSC, is expected to grow its market

95
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,577
share over time by opening new restaurants.

96
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,160
We are going to assume that it's going

97
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,520
to grow at a constant rate which is not known.

98
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,650
Each new restaurant is going to be just

99
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,210
like the old restaurants.

100
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,600
They're going to generate $1 million in profits every year

101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,110
forever.

102
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,380
We're assuming that when the company opens a new restaurant,

103
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,000
the cash flows start the following year.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,270
So if it were to open the restaurant this year,

105
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,960
the first cash flow is going to arrive a year later.

106
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,200
KSC is a publicly traded firm.

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,875
And its current market capitalization is $200 million.

108
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,250
We are assuming that the discount

109
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,690
rate, the expected return on its stock, is 10% per year.

110
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,650
And that will remain constant forever.

111
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,380
The question is, at what rate does the market

112
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,530
expect KSC to grow in terms of growing

113
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,730
its number of restaurants over time?

114
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,470
For our company, this means that the growth rate

115
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,580
g is equal to 0.1, which is the expected return,

116
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,530
minus the total dividend next year, which is $10 million--

117
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,380
remember that the company currently owns 10 restaurants,

118
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,670
and each of them is going to generate $1 million next year--

119
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,440
divided by the initial price, $200 million.

120
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,870
The end result is that the expected growth

121
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,320
rate, which is priced into the value of the firm, is 5%.

122
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,680
In other words, based on the current valuation

123
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,420
of this company, the market must be expecting the growth

124
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,220
at the rate of 5%.

125
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,720
So each year, the company is going

126
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,740
to increase its number of restaurants by 5%.
