00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,150
PROFESSOR: We now know how to price equities in relation

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,940
to their future dividends and discount rates.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,150
Expected future dividends are an important input

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,980
into equity pricing.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,830
Forecasting dividends is a complex problem.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,490
Our approach here is to relate dividends of the firm

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,320
to other fundamentals.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,960
In particular, we are going to relate firm's dividends

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,750
to its profits.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,910
For simplicity, we assume that the firm

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,860
is all equity financed.

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,040
It does not have debt and makes no interest payments.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,770
We start with firm's profits, its earnings per share,

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,760
which we define net of depreciation and taxes.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,510
Dividends are related to earnings by the payout ratio.

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,480
The payout ratio is simply a ratio of dividends per share

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,270
to earnings per share.

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,240
This ratio tells us what fraction of firm's earnings

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,360
is paid out to its investors.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,150
The remaining profits are reinvested into the firm.

21
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,240
Algebraically, dividends per share

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,310
are equal to earnings per share times the payout ratio.

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,150
Next, we think about how to forecast earnings.

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,360
The key input into the forecast is retained earnings.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,920
Retained earnings are equal to the difference between earnings

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,310
and dividends and represent the portion of the firm's cash

27
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,300
flows reinvested into the business.

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,190
The fraction of the earnings retained by the firm

29
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,770
is called the plowback ratio.

30
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,220
It is the ratio of retained to total earnings

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,790
and is equal to 1 minus the payout ratio.

32
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,230
For example, if a firm generates $2.00 per share in earnings

33
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,110
and pays out $0.80 to its investors,

34
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,210
then the payout ratio is 40% and the plowback ratio is 60%,

35
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,710
with $1.20 reinvested into the firm.

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,680
We should note, as an aside, that by accumulating

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,780
retained earnings over time, we can

38
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,170
keep track of the firm's book value of equity, which

39
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,990
is an accounting measure of firm value.

40
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,340
Unlike the market value of equity,

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,970
which is a forward looking measure of firm value,

42
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,250
the book value is backward looking

43
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,250
and is simply a summary of the history of firm's investments.

44
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,400
Firms' investments generate incremental cash flows

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
in the future.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,540
We assume, for simplicity, that an investment at time t

47
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,410
generates a constant, perpetual stream of additional cash flows

48
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,682
starting from the next period, t plus 1.

49
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:39,170
We will also assume that, without additional investments,

50
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,420
firms expect that future earnings remain constant.

51
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,140
We make both of these assumptions for simplicity

52
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,670
in order to focus on the conceptual elements

53
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,320
of this analysis.

54
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,880
One can replace these assumptions

55
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,390
with a more realistic and complex model of how investment

56
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,875
generates incremental earnings.

57
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,260


58
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,590
Consider the following example.

59
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,790
A company, Texas Western, or TW, is expected to earn $1.00 per

60
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,420
share next year.

61
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,210
The firm plans an expansion to increase its earnings

62
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,220
by 8% per year.

63
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,180
Without these additional investments, earnings of TW

64
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,560
are expected to remain constant forever.

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
Each additional dollar of investment generates

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,160
incremental perpetual cash flow of $0.10 starting

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,700
in the following period.

68
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,990
We assume that all new investment is

69
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,810
financed by retained earnings.

70
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,110
The discount rate is 10%.

71
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,940
We assume that this discount rate applies to all future cash

72
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,210
flows of the firm.

73
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,800
Our task is to determine the price of TW shares and the two

74
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,350
alternative growth strategies.

75
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,890
In the first case, TW pays out all of its earnings

76
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,320
forever and does not invest.

77
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,910
In the second case, TW expands and grows its earnings forever

78
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,410
at 8% per year.

79
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,960


80
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,780
We start with the case of no investment.

81
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,640
In this case, the firm pays out 100% of its earnings.

82
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,899
Without investment, earnings of TW remain at the same expected

83
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,290
level of $1.00 per share forever.

84
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,140
Because the payout ratio is 100%,

85
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,120
dividends per share are also expected to be $1.00 forever.

86
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,410
Applying the 10% discount rate to future dividends, we find,

87
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,470
using the perpetuity formula, that the initial price

88
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,900
of the stock is $10.00 per share.

89
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,690
Next consider the case of perpetual growth.

90
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,800
TW aims to grow its earnings at the rate of 8% per year.

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,940
The first question we must answer is, at what rate

92
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,790
should TW reinvest its earnings to achieve

93
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,200
the 8% rate of growth?

94
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
In other words, we want to determine the required plowback

95
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,840
ratio.

96
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,350
Suppose that, at time t, TW invests fraction

97
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,890
b of its earnings.

98
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,770
This investment raises all future earnings

99
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,900
by 10% of the total amount invested,

100
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,670
which is the plowback ratio times its earnings in period t.

101
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,020
As a result, earnings per share at time t plus 1

102
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,890
are equal to the EPS in the previous period times 1

103
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,020
plus 0.1 times the plowback ratio.

104
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,830
We conclude that to achieve an 8% growth rate,

105
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,540
the firm must use the plowback ratio of 80%.

106
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,320
The payout rate must then equal 20%.

107
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,950
Under the permanent expansion at the 8% rate,

108
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,300
dividends per share in the first year are expected to be $0.20,

109
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,290
which is 20% of the expected earnings.

110
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,320
Using the constant growth model, the initial price

111
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,130
of the stock of TW is equal to the expected dividend,

112
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,430
next period, divided by the difference between the discount

113
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,940
rate and the expected dividend growth rate.

114
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,360
The initial stock price is then $10.00 per share.

115
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,320
The price of the stock is the same as in the no growth

116
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,700
scenario.

117
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,530
Why are the two values the same?

118
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,610
The reason is firm's future investments

119
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,520
do not add anything to the firm value.

120
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,140
Each time TW invests $1.00, it generates a perpetual cash flow

121
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,040
stream of $0.10, starting a period later.

122
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,850
The NPV of this investment with the discount rate of 10% is 0.

123
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,100
As we will learn in the following section,

124
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,400
this means that TW has no growth opportunities.

125
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,370
Because our assumptions imply that all new investments are

126
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,970
0 NPV, the value of TW does not depend on its growth strategy.
