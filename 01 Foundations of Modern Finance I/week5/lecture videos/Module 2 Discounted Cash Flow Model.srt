1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,390
PROFESSOR: We will now develop a basic valuation model

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:09,390
for equities called Discounted Cash Flow Model, or DCF Model.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,770
Let's look at the prices of several financial companies.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,740
These are large banks like J.P. Morgan, Bank of America,

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,640
and so forth.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,890
In the table, you can see prices per share

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,550
as well as earnings per share and the valuation ratios,

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,190
such as the price to earnings ratio of price to sales ratio.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,660
What is interesting about this is

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,180
that these firms are very different in terms

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,510
of their overall size, or market cap.

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,580
Some of them extremely large, like Bank

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,170
of America and JP Morgan Chase, some are a lot smaller.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,880
But when we look at their valuation ratios,

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,390
such as the price to earnings ratio,

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,270
those ratios are fairly close to each other.

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,320
What this suggests, what this pattern is telling us,

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,560
is that there is something that all of these financial firms

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,580
seem to have in common as far as their valuation is concerned.

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,980
The market is pricing these stocks

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,490
at a similar multiple in relation to their earnings.

22
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,190
Let's compare this to the automakers.

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,150
Now we are looking at various car manufacturers, Toyota,

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,650
Volkswagen, BMW, and so forth.

25
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,880
Again, these companies are very heterogeneous in terms

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,770
of their overall size.

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,820
Their valuation ratios also tend to be closely related

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,350
to each other.

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,750
They are lower than those for the banks.

30
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,650
So what is going on?

31
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,010
Why is it that car manufacturers are

32
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,040
priced on average at the lower level

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,010
as a fraction of their earnings, as a P/E multiple,

34
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,840
compared to banks?

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,450
What determines valuation of different types of stocks?

36
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,160
That's the question that we want to answer.

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,050
We're going to start with very basic theoretical observations.

38
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,130
Let's look at the present value of a security

39
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,690
a stock in this case and relate it to the cash flows,

40
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,230
the dividends.

41
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,550
This is going to give us the discounted cash flow model.

42
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,520
Our notation is going to be Pt for the expected stock

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,840
price at time t, this is the ex-dividend price,

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,610
the price of the security immediately

45
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,830
after it pays off the dividend.

46
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,016
Dt is the expected dividend at time t.

47
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:27,450
And Rt is the expected stock return over period t.

48
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,430
We start with an accounting identity,

49
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,050
the definition of returns.

50
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,040
1 plus the expected return is equal to the total cash

51
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,980
flow at time 1, which is the dividend

52
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,820
plus the price of the security, P1, divided

53
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,390
by the initial price, P0.

54
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,480
This is the definition of expected return, R1.

55
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,150
We can rewrite this formula to express

56
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,570
the price of the security at time 0 in relation

57
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,580
to the expected dividend a time 1,

58
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,760
the expected price at time 1, and the expected return.

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,450
The price at times 0 is equal to D1 plus P1, the expected

60
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,860
period for time 1 discounted at R1,

61
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,260
the expected rate of return.

62
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,470
The lesson here is that the price

63
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,020
can be computed as expected cash flow discounted at the discount

64
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,790
factor, which is equal to the expected

65
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,200
return on the security.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,010
This relation is an accounting of mathematical identity.

67
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,590
It doesn't rely on any economic assumptions.

68
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,250
It is simply true because of how we define returns

69
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,570
on securities.

70
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,130
Now let's use our pricing formula and iterate forward.

71
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,770
We are going to substitute out P1.

72
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:50,400
We will replace it by the discounted value of D2 plus P2.

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,620
What we obtain as a result is the relation within the price

74
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,510
at time 0 and the dividend at time 1, the dividend at time 2,

75
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,090
and the price at time 2.

76
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,270
Again, the price at time 0 is a discounted value of future cash

77
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,040
flows at time 1 and 2.

78
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,350
To simplify, let's assume that expected returns

79
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,450
during every period are the same, they're equal to R.

80
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,000
We can continue this process, continue moving forward,

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,480
substituting out the price using our one period DCF

82
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,760
formula to obtain the following equation, the price at time 0

83
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,120
is equal to the sum of the expected dividends

84
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,350
during future periods discounted at the rate of return R

85
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,580
plus the residual term, which is the price at time capital

86
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,500
T discounted at the rate of return, again,

87
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,560
our expected return of the stock.

88
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,690
The price of the stock is therefore

89
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,690
equal to the discounted value of future dividends

90
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,390
plus the discounted value of the terminal price, Pt.

91
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:02,300
The discount factor equals the expected stock return.

92
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,810
If we take this sum to a limit by letting capital

93
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,260
T go to infinity and make an additional assumption

94
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,430
that the discounted value of the terminal price, p capital T,

95
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,050
converges to 0, we obtain an infinite horizon discounted

96
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,570
cash flow formula, which tells us

97
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,420
that the price of the stock at time 0

98
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,650
is equal to the discounted value of future dividends from 1

99
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,300
to infinity, where each expected future dividend is discounted

100
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,620
at the expected rate of return on the stock.
