1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:04,960
PROFESSOR: Next, we consider multi-stage growth models.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,840
The Gordon model, the constant growth model,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,970
is a useful approximation.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,190
It's also a useful building block

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,680
for constructing more realistic models.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,810
But of course, the assumption of constant growth

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,350
forever is typically not a good approximation

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,620
to how real firms behave.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,260
It is more realistic to think of the company

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,750
as going through different stages of growth

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,160
throughout its lifecycle.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,330
When the firm is young, it may start small and grow rapidly

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,270
by capturing an increasing market share.

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,160
Over time, as the company grows larger and larger,

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,190
it's going to be harder to maintain the same growth rate.

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,030
There may be some initial competitive advantages

17
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,070
that the firm has.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,130
Over time, competition is going to catch up.

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,940
Also, as the company gets large in terms of its market share,

20
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,280
increasing the market share further is going to become

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,810
progressively difficult. So in the long run,

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,080
we cannot expect large, established firms to grow

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,580
at the same rate as young growth firms.

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,620
The way to model this is to assume

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,470
that in the early stages, the company may

26
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,510
go through a so-called growth stage

27
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,570
with a relatively high growth rate, which will eventually

28
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,920
slow down.

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,200
And long term, the company is going

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,450
to reach maturity, at which point

31
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,690
the growth rate is going to be relatively low

32
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,240
and is going to converge to some kind of average

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,730
for the same type of firms, perhaps average for the sector.

34
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,360
Now, let's consider an example.

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,480
Northern Company is expected to pay $1 per share in dividends

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,170
next year.

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,770
This number is expected to grow at a 10% rate for the next 5

38
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,120
years.

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,370
After that, the growth rate of the company

40
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,080
is going to slow down.

41
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,400
And it's going to be 2% from that point on, forever.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,380
The cost of capital of this company,

43
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,150
or the discount rate on its cash flows, is 8%.

44
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,550
The question is, what is the current share

45
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,260
price of the Northern Company?

46
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,680
The following table projects dividends per share

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,600
for this firm over the next several years.

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,640
You can see that at time 1, the dividend is expected to be $1.

49
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,830
And this is going to grow at a 10% rate.

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,970
So it's going to be 1.1 in year 2, 1.21 in the year 3,

51
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,360
and so forth, until we hit year 6.

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,420
And after that, the growth rate is going to slow down to 2%.

53
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,180
We are going to value this stock by dividing

54
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,770
the timeline into two portions.

55
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,290
The first segment is going to be from year 0 up to

56
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,350
and including year 6.

57
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,470
The second segment is going to start in year 7

58
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,390
and go all the way to infinity.

59
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,270
We are going to price these two portions of cash flow

60
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,920
separately.

61
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,650
So let's start with the residual piece, which

62
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,040
is D7, D8, and so forth.

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,940
We are going to compute the price of this residual segment

64
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,310
from the point of view of time 6.

65
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,430
From the perspective of time 6, what we're dealing with

66
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,810
is a Gordon model.

67
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,640
The growth rate of the company starting from P at 7

68
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,010
is constant.

69
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,800
We can therefore apply the Gordon formula.

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,930
The price of the stock at time 6 is

71
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,920
equal to D7, the expected cash flow at time 7, which

72
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,480
is 1.64 divided by r, the discount rate, minus g,

73
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,020
the growth rate, which at that point is 2%.

74
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:50,450
So 1.64 divided by 8% minus 2% is $27.38.

75
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,500
That is the residual value of the stock at time 6, P6.

76
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,220
Now, we can use our DCF formula at time 0.

77
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,580
The price of the stock at time 0 is equal to the sum,

78
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,320
from 1 to 6, of the dividends discounted

79
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,710
at the 8% rate, which is the expected return,

80
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,340
plus the residual term P6 discounted

81
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,260
at the same 8% rate over 6 years.

82
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,630
When we compute the sum, the end result is $23.07.

83
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,190
And that is the value of the firm

84
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,050
under this two-stage growth assumption.
