00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,010
PROFESSOR: We started this week by observing

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,400
that valuation ratios seem to be systematically

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,190
different across different types of firms.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,800
Financials and automakers are trading

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,470
at different valuation ratios, or different P/E ratios.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,870
We can now see that one reason why

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,570
firms may trade at different P/E ratios

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,810
is because of differences in their growth opportunities.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,370
Let's take a closer look.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,540
Suppose that the ROE of the firm is constant over time.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,300
The price of the stock has two components.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,430
One component represents the value of the firm

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,950
without growth and the second component

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,300
reflects the value of future growth opportunities, PVGO.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,070
The value of the firm without growth

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,290
is given by the expected earnings

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,540
at time 1, which are going to continue

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,440
in perpetuity without growth, divided by the cost of capital

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,270
R. The present value of growth opportunities

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,140
is the discounted value of the NPV of future investments

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,769
that the firm makes.

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,710
Now let's define the P/E ratio formula.

23
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,690
The P/E ratio under our definition

24
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,560
is the ratio of the price of the stock at time 0 to the expected

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,470
earnings at time 1.

26
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,090
Our definition is different from the common definition used

27
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,520
in the business media, where the price of the stock at time 0

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,160
is divided by the lagged earnings, which

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,660
are also measured at time 0.

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,960
Now let's use our formula.

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,200
The price of the stock is equal to the expected earnings

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,350
divided by the cost of capital plus the present value

33
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,910
of growth opportunities.

34
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,180
Suppose that the firm does not have any growth opportunities.

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,160
PVGO is 0.

36
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,300
In this case, the P/E ratio is equal to 1 over r,

37
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,950
1 over the cost of capital.

38
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,400
If the present value of growth opportunities is positive,

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,840
the P/E ratio is equal to 1 over r plus the ratio of PVGO,

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,550
the earnings at time 1, or specifically expected earnings

41
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,560
at time 1.

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,100
What we see is that for the firm with higher present value

43
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,590
of growth opportunities, the P/E ratio

44
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,140
is higher, which means that P/E ratio reflects

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,950
how rich the firm is in growth opportunities.

46
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,850
This is one of the reasons why we observe different valuation

47
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,730
ratios, different price to earnings ratios,

48
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,340
across different industries and across different types

49
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,690
of firms.

50
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,510
This reflects different growth prospects

51
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,840
that these firms are facing.
