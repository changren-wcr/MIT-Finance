00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:01,690
PROFESSOR: In this segment, we will

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,330
learn how to think about growth opportunities,

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,170
how to value them, and how much opportunities for future growth

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,250
contribute to the price of the stock.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,170
First, define what the growth opportunities are.

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,350
Growth opportunities are future investment opportunities

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,180
that generate a positive NPV.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,580
Such investment opportunities contribute positively

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,760
to the firm value.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,420
Stocks of companies with access to future growth opportunities

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,479
are considered growth stocks.

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,910
The term growth stock is used casually

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,500
to refer to firms which would not

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,690
be called growth stocks under our formal definition.

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,680
For example, a firm with growing sales

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,310
is not necessarily investing at a positive NPV,

17
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,970
as we have seen in our example of Texas Western.

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,330
Same goes for the firms with growing assets or growing

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,170
dividends.

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,690
The bottom line-- a growth firm is

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,920
a firm able to make positive NPV investments in the future.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Our objective is to figure out how to value such growth

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,830
opportunities.

24
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,320
Consider the following example.

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,560
Expected earnings per share of ABC Software

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,410
will be $8.33 next year.

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,820
ABC will pay out 60% of its earnings as dividends forever.

28
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,690
Assume that new investments will generate

29
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,700
a perpetual expected cash flow stream of $0.25

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,530
for each dollar invested.

31
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,200
The discount rate for all cash flows is 15%.

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,900
We need to figure out what portion of firm value

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,310
reflects the value of its growth opportunities.

34
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,700
To do that, we compute the price of the stock

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,230
in two different ways--

36
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,920
with and without growth.

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,700
We define the present value of growth opportunities, or PVGO,

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,700
as the difference between the actual stock price

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,650
and the price that would apply without growth,

40
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,560
which would correspond to 100% payout and no investment.

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,366
We first compute the stock price with growth.

42
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,910
The expected dividend per share in the first year

43
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,390
is 60% of expected earnings, which is $5.

44
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,370
Under the parameters of the problem,

45
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,770
both earnings and dividends of the firm

46
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,850
are expected to grow at the 10% rate.

47
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,500
To see this, compute the expected earnings

48
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,950
in the second period.

49
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,600
Investment in the first period is 40% of the firm's earnings,

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,480
or $3.33 per share.

51
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,070
Each dollar investment raises future earnings by $0.25.

52
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,850
So the first period investment raises second period earnings

53
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,000
by $0.83 relative to the first period.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,340
This implies a 10% growth rate.

55
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,250
The same argument applies to all future periods.

56
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,530
So both earnings and dividends are

57
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,455
expected to grow at the 10% rate forever.

58
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:05,050


59
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,860
The price of the stock is given by the constant growth formula.

60
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,760
Stock price at time 0 equals the expected dividend

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,610
in the first period divided by the difference

62
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,860
between the discount rate and the dividend growth rate.

63
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,680
This means that the initial stock price is $100 per share.

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,960
Under the no growth policy, the firm

65
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,050
pays out all of its earnings as dividends.

66
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,780
In this case, dividends in the first period

67
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,730
are $8.33 per share.

68
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,170
The value of the stock is given by the constant growth formula.

69
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,110
Without growth, this is simply the expected dividend

70
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,140
next period over the discount rate,

71
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,960
which equals $55.56 per share.

72
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,280
The difference between the stock price with and without growth

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
is $44.44.

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,990
This represents the present value

75
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,100
of growth opportunities of ABC.

76
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,480
Next, we take a closer look at how future investments of ABC

77
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,180
add to the firm value.

78
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,660
At time 1, ABC invests 40% of its earnings, which

79
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,630
equals the $3.33 per share.

80
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,920
With each dollar producing $0.25 in addition of future earnings,

81
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,000
the time 1 investment generates additional expected earnings

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,750
of $0.83 in all future periods, starting with period two.

83
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,380
The NPV of the time 1 investment is the present value

84
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,800
of the perpetual stream of $0.83 per year.

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:48,630
Net of the initial investment of $3.33, which adds up to $2.22.

86
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,300
At time 2, the same logic applies.

87
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,480
Because the magnitude of the firm's investment rises by 10%,

88
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,170
all resulting cash flows grow by 10% as well.

89
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,070
And so does the NPV of its investment.

90
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,670
We conclude that the NPV of the time 2 investment

91
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,450
is 10% higher than the NPV of the time 1 investment

92
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,940
and equals $2.44.

93
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,270
Applying the same valuation process to all future years,

94
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,200
we find that firm investments generate a stream of NPVs

95
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,300
growing at 10% per year.

96
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,080
The total present value of ABC's future investment

97
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,080
is then given by the constant growth formula.

98
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,250
The initial cash flow is the NPV of the time 1 investment.

99
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,930
The discount rate is 15%, and the growth rate is 10%.

100
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,110
This implies the present value of growth opportunities

101
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,300
of $44.44 per share, which is the same value we uncovered

102
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,150
by comparing the price of the stock with and without growth.
