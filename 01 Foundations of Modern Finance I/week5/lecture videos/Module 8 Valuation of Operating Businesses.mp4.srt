1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,240
PROFESSOR: So far, we talked about the valuation of stocks.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,710
But the same techniques can be used

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,410
to value the entire business.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,390
We don't need to be focusing just on equities.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,960
So let's start with the discounted cash flow formula.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,030
The present value of the business

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,130
is equal to the discounted expected value of the free cash

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,170
flows that the business generates

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:32,570
between time 1 and time capital T plus the present value

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,480
of the remaining cash flows, which we call PV capital

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,470
T discounted back to time zero.

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,770
What you see here is that we are splitting the timeline

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,240
into two portions.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,240
We're discounting cash flows between time 1 and time capital

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,980
T separately.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,260
And then we are discounting the residual,

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,370
which we call the horizon value a time capital T.

18
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,340
We are focusing on the free cash flows, which

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,850
is net cash flows that can be attributed to the business

20
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,590
that we are evaluating.

21
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,780
In order to apply this formula, we

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,830
need to forecast cash flows from time 1 to time capital T.

23
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:15,330
And we need to predict the horizon value, PV capital T.

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,940
In our previous analysis, we focused

25
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,030
on the forecasting of payouts, dividends, or in this case,

26
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,080
we can use the same techniques for free cash flows.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,970
What we now need to do is figure out

28
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,030
how to predict the horizon value PV capital

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,810
T. This is the focus of our current discussion.

30
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,370
There are several alternative methods

31
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,680
that one could use to forecast the horizon value.

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
We are going to look at three alternatives.

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,850
The first method uses P/E multiples.

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,350
What this means is that we are going

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,710
to forecast the profits that this business generates at time

36
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,380
capital T. And then scale them by the P/E multiple, which

37
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,370
is a typical price-to-earnings ratio that is applied to stocks

38
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,240
that we view as comparable to the business

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,000
that we're evaluating.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,310
The second approach is similar in nature.

41
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,810
We're also using comparables.

42
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,480
We're also looking for the valuation

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,920
ratios of similar firms, similar traded businesses.

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,630
But instead of the P/E ratio, we're

45
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,850
using the price-to-book ratio, which

46
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,860
is the ratio of the market price of equity to its book value.

47
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,280
The last approach is what we call the DCF approach.

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
In this case, we do not use valuation multiples.

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,730
We are determining the horizon value using the discounted cash

50
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,850
flow formula by making particular assumptions

51
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,070
about future growth of the business after time capital T.

52
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,090
Now, what is the logic behind using multipliers

53
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,700
versus the DCF approach?

54
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,640
The multiplier approach is a particular type

55
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,990
of relative valuation.

56
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,970
It is a relative valuation approach

57
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,740
where we are looking for companies

58
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,990
that are similar to the firm under consideration.

59
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,650
And we're asking how much the market

60
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,620
is paying for those businesses in relation

61
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,960
to either their book value or the profits

62
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,120
that they're generating.

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,070
The challenge with using this approach

64
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,070
is that businesses generally are not the same.

65
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,000
It is not easy to find two firms that

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,180
are very close comparables.

67
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,060
What we're doing here is a hybrid approach,

68
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,130
where we are forecasting cash flows

69
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,470
over the first several periods explicitly.

70
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,150
And we're discounting them.

71
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,300
And then we're applying the multiples approach

72
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,620
at time capital T.

73
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,870
The logic of this is that even though it

74
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,170
may be quite difficult to find very good comparable firms

75
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,720
at time zero, this gets progressively easier as we

76
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,660
are looking into the future.

77
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,670
And the reason for that is that there

78
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,500
tends to be a certain degree of convergence

79
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,780
between different types of firms in expectation.

80
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,440
So the firms that look very different at time zero

81
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,420
in expectation look less different.

82
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,300
And therefore, the multiples approach

83
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,980
becomes more and more accurate.

84
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,650
Now, one can say that the multiples approach is not

85
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,740
a pure fundamental approach to valuation because rather

86
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,399
than discounting cash flows, we're using multiples.

87
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,540
At the end of the day, the DCF formula,

88
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,170
the multiples approach, are different versions

89
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,600
of relative valuation.

90
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,450
If we want to use a pure DCF approach,

91
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,150
we're going to make assumptions about future growth

92
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,260
of the firm.

93
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,580
For example, if we assume that beyond certain horizon

94
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,210
the firm exhausts its growth opportunities, for instance,

95
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,920
competition catches up.

96
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,580
And the firm can no longer make positive NPV investments.

97
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,460
We can figure out what the horizon value is.

98
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,750
It is going to be equal to the free cash flow at time capital

99
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,980
T plus 1 under the no-growth assumption discounted

100
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,450
as a perpetuity without growth.

101
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,960
So it's free cash flow time t plus 1

102
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,200
divided by the opportunity cost of capital.

103
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,610
Consider the following example or the data given in the table.

104
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,680
We have a business here, which starts

105
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,480
with the asset value of 5.

106
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,510
Think of it as 5 million.

107
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,690
And it grows over time.

108
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,280
For each period, from 1 to six, we

109
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,610
can see how the asset value evolves.

110
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,070
How this business generates earnings.

111
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,260
And we can see net investment.

112
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,700
That investment is the investment into the business

113
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,250
in the form of CAPX, capital expenditure,

114
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,810
net of depreciation.

115
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,680
Earnings here are also measured net of depreciation.

116
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,220
Now, the free cash flow that this business generates

117
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,900
is equal to earnings minus its net investment.

118
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,010
This is the cash flow that is left after the firm reinvests

119
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,700
back into the business.

120
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,440
We make an assumption about the discount rate.

121
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,130
The discount rate is constant at 15%.

122
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,260
And therefore, we can compute the discount factor,

123
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,870
which is then applied to cash flows in different periods.

124
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,410
This is given at the bottom of the table.

125
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,450
In our example, the company is going

126
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,580
through two stages of growth.

127
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,450
In the first few years, growth rate is relatively high.

128
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,020
And the firm is reinvesting a lot back into the business.

129
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,440
And therefore, the free cash flow may in fact be negative.

130
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,780
This does not mean that the firm is losing money.

131
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,690
It simply means that the firm is investing more

132
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,440
than the cash it is generating.

133
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,140
After the first few years, growth rate

134
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:46,270
slows down and investment declines accordingly.

135
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,550
The present value of this business

136
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,310
can be computed as the present value of the free cash

137
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,140
flows of the first several years for 1

138
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,390
to capital T plus the present value of the horizon value

139
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,780
at time capital T. We will now use our three

140
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,990
alternative approaches to estimate the present value

141
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,300
of the business.

142
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,190
Let's start with the multiples approach, the P/E multiples,

143
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,280
in particular.

144
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,450
We are going to discount free cash flows from 1 to 4.

145
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,090
And then apply the multiples approach

146
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,020
to figure out the horizon value at time 4.

147
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,930
The present value of the free cash flows from 1 to 4

148
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,770
is minus $1.42.

149
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,580
This reflects the fact that the firm in the early periods

150
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,840
is investing more than the cash flow it is generating.

151
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,200
To estimate the horizon value, PV4,

152
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,620
we need to apply the P multiples for comparable firms

153
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,100
to the expected earnings of the firm at time 5,

154
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,440
one period forward.

155
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Expected earnings generated at time 5 are estimated at $1.75.

156
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,190
Let's assume that the P multiple for comparable firms

157
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,760
is equal to six.

158
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,640
In which case, we are going to multiply the expected

159
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,360
that earnings at time 5 by a factor of six

160
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,810
to estimate the horizon value at time 4, PV4.

161
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,580
The present value of this horizon value is $10.50,

162
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,705
which is the value at time 4 discounted at the 15% rate back

163
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:34,440
to time zero, which is $6.

164
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,669
Next, let's estimate the firm value, the business value,

165
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,610
using the price-to-book multiples.

166
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,490
The logic is very similar to the previous calculation.

167
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,030
Except now, instead of using the ratio of price-to-earnings

168
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,920
for comparable firms, we are going

169
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,950
to use the ratio of price-to-book, the market

170
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,090
value of equity divided by the book value.

171
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,480
Again, we're estimating the horizon value at time 4.

172
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,990
The book value at time 4, the value of the assets, is $11.75.

173
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,680
And this gets scaled by the average book-to-price ratio

174
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,120
for comparable firms, which we assume to be equal to 1.2.

175
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,190
As a result, our estimate of the horizon value is $14.10.

176
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,640
And discounted back to time zero at the 15% rate,

177
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,070
this gives us $8.06.

178
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,180
Our final calculation uses the pure DCF approach.

179
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,330
Under this approach, we have to establish a point in time

180
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,720
beyond which the firm is expected to have no remaining

181
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
growth opportunities.

182
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,075
For the sake of the argument, suppose that that period is T

183
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:45,350
equal to 5.

184
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,930
From that point on, the firm is going

185
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,850
to produce no positive NPV.

186
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,380
And therefore, at time 5, we comprise the horizon value

187
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,410
using the no growth formula.

188
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,980
Let's do that.

189
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,270
Between periods 1 and 5, the free cash flows of the firm,

190
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,580
after being discounted back to time zero,

191
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,430
adapt to minus $0.95.

192
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,710
The present value at time 5 can be

193
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,690
computed as the earnings, which is what the firm would pay out

194
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,750
with the no growth assumption.

195
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,470
Discounted at the cost of capital, 15%.

196
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,390
Because without growth, the firm would

197
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,460
be expected to pay $1.88, which is the earning set times 6

198
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,180
in perpetuity.

199
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,680
At the end of this, we find that the horizon value at time 5

200
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,130
is estimated to be $12.55.

201
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:46,270
And discounted back to time 0, this gives us $6.24.

202
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,600
Notice that we are using different horizons,

203
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,120
capital T under these alternative relation

204
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,200
approaches.

205
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,270
This is just to highlight the fact

206
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,900
that there is no reason to pick the same horizon when

207
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,080
we're using the multiples approach versus DCF.

208
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,240
The logic is not identical.

209
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,690
Under the multiples approach, we are comparing the firm

210
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,610
to other similar firms.

211
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,340
We simply want to find the point in time when we think

212
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,800
this comparison is accurate.

213
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,550
Under the pure DCF approach, we are finding a point a time

214
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,210
beyond which we feel comfortable forecasting firm growth.

215
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,450
In this particular example, we are finding a point in time

216
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,530
beyond which the firm has no remaining growth opportunities.

217
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,330
And therefore, the value of the firm

218
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,360
can be computed under the no growth assumption.

219
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,270
We now pull together our estimates.

220
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,270
Using the P multiples, we estimate the present value

221
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,980
to be $4.58.

222
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,790
Under the price-to-book multiple approximation,

223
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,120
we find the present value to be $6.64.

224
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,060
And using the pure DCF approach, the value is $5.29.

225
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,340
The solution using the P/E multiples

226
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,430
gives us the most conservative estimate of the firm value.

227
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,410
Now, firm valuation is not a simple problem.

228
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,360
And our estimates are based on a number

229
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,780
of simplifying assumptions.

230
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,520
What we get from this analysis is the sense

231
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,890
of the range of likely values.

232
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,960
This range can be fairly wide, which is

233
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,370
what our analysis illustrates.

234
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,280
In order to apply these results, we have to look further.

235
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,310
We have to study sensitivity of these numbers

236
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,040
to their underlying assumptions.

237
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,170
At the end of the day, what we find

238
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,330
is that valuation is not a simple problem.

239
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,640
However, we now have the tools to tackle it.
