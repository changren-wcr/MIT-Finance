1
00:00:00,595 --> 00:00:01,970
PROFESSOR: In this lecture, we're

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,890
going to talk about the relation of stocks.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,730
We're going to start with a quick overview of equities,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,000
stocks and securities, and the markets where they trade,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,420
and then introduce the basic tools for equity valuation.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,710
Now, stocks are relatively well known financial securities.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,450
Common stocks represent equity or ownership positions

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,440
in the corporation.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,290
They allow for a distributed form of ownership

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,820
of public companies.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,680
When your own shares of a stock, let's

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,860
say, your own shares of IBM, you effectively

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,200
are one of the owners of the company.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,290
You may own a small fraction of the company in proportion

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,490
to the number of shares, but you are one of the owners.

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,260
And this is how large public companies

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,110
can be owned by large groups of investors

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,630
through their ownership of stocks.

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,750
Stocks deliver payments to their owners

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,310
in the form of dividends, which are cash payments and share

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,310
repurchases, which are transactions

22
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,490
in the market where the company buys back its own shares.

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,470
These are different types of transactions.

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,150
They have different properties, but the end result is the same.

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,340
By paying dividends or by buying back shares,

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,830
the company is able to distribute cash back

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,650
to its owners, back to the shareholders.

28
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,690
If you compare ownership of stocks to ownership of bonds,

29
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,060
payments to the bond holders are contractual.

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,000
They're fixed in the definition of the security.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,800
They're not discretionary.

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,610
In contrast, payments to the stockholders are discretionary,

33
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,670
and they're uncertain.

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,000
The timing of these payments and their amount

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,550
are not guaranteed, and are subject to the discretion

36
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,850
of the management and to various types of risks,

37
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,650
business risks to which the company is

38
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,680
exposed, market conditions changing, and so forth.

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,880
Stocks have several important basic characteristics.

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,710
One is that stocks are what we call residual claims.

41
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,300
Stockholders get paid after the company has paid its creditors.

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,640
In other words, stocks are relatively

43
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,610
junior in the capital structure of the firm compared

44
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,250
to debt obligations.

45
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,670
The company has to repay its bonds.

46
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,410
If there is money left after that,

47
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,780
it can pay the stockholders.

48
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,870
Stocks are limited liability instruments.

49
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,680
What this means is that when you buy a share of a company,

50
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
you can lose as much as the entire investment, but no more

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
than that.

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,440
For example, if you own a fraction of a company by owning

53
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,770
shares and the company is the subject of a lawsuit,

54
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,920
whatever the settlement may be, you cannot lose more than

55
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,060
your investment.

56
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,640
Your own personal assets are not on the line.

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,370
This is what is called limited liability.

58
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,530
Limited liability is an important feature

59
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,950
of many financial securities, and as you can see,

60
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,330
it is a key to allowing for distributed ownership.

61
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,440
Stocks also confer voting rights to their owners.

62
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
Stockholders can participate in corporate governance.

63
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,960
They can vote on important corporate events.

64
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,720
For example, they can vote during elections

65
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,640
for the board of directors.

66
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,910
They can vote on large corporate actions,

67
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,860
like mergers and acquisitions.

68
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,630
They can vote on executive compensation and so forth.

69
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,730
Day to day operations of the firm are run by the management.

70
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,620
Firm owners, the shareholders, are not

71
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,050
involved in these tactical decisions,

72
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,040
but they can be involved in strategic actions,

73
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,260
such as mergers and acquisitions.

74
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,310
And they can participate by voting.

75
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,770
How exactly the votes are distributed in relation

76
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,920
to share ownership depends.

77
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,110
It varies firms to firm, but typically, it

78
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,730
is one share, one vote.

79
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,620
The more shares you own, the more votes you control.

80
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,200
When we think about trading of stocks,

81
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,240
we can conceptually think about two types

82
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,360
of markets, the primary market and the secondary market.

83
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,000
The primary market transaction is

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,800
a transaction between the firm and its investors shareholders.

85
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,170
For example, if it's a relatively young firm,

86
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,740
it doesn't trade in the public markets.

87
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,738
It is raising money from investors.

88
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:24,280
For instance, it may be raising money

89
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,800
from a venture capital firm.

90
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,560
It engages in a primary market transaction.

91
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,700
It would issue shares and sell them to a VC company

92
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,960
to raise capital.

93
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,510
At a later stage as the firm matures,

94
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,030
it may get listed for public trading,

95
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,820
and then it would sell its shares to the broader

96
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,740
group of investors.

97
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,233
This event is called an initial public offering, the IPO.

98
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,650
That's when the shares of the firm

99
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,990
get listed on one of the standard exchanges.

100
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,500
This is also a primary market transaction.

101
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,130
The company is selling shares to its investors.

102
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,830
At a later stage in the lifecycle, the firm,

103
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,630
the company can raise more capital

104
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,060
from investors in the form of equity.

105
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,070
It may sell additional shares.

106
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,710
This is called a secondary equity offering, an SEO.

107
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,140
Again, it's a transaction between the firm

108
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,060
and its investors.

109
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,580
These types of transactions when the firm is raising money

110
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,070
from investors are typically facilitated

111
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,760
by financial intermediaries, like investment banks.

112
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,850
They help to make sure that this process goes smoothly,

113
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,150
the firm is able to raise the desired amount of capital,

114
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,300
and the shares go into the hands of the right types

115
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,560
of investors.

116
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,830
These transactions are called underwriting.

117
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,340
When we think about the secondary market,

118
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,960
this is the market where shares get traded between investors.

119
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,170
This market does not involve the firm itself.

120
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,300
This is a resale market.

121
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,390
This is what most of the investors are familiar with,

122
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,390
and this is where most of the trading takes place.

123
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,390
By now, there are many competing exchanges

124
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,550
where trading takes place, as well as

125
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,800
additional trading venues.

126
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,860
Some of the best known exchanges and those controlling

127
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,950
the largest percentage of the trading volume in the United

128
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,650
States and globally are NYSE, New York Stock Exchange, CBOE,

129
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,430
the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, and NASDAQ.

130
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,770
These exchanges are regulated by the SEC.

131
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,260
They are subject to regulatory oversight,

132
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,570
and they have to maintain certain standards

133
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,610
and provide investor protection.

134
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,180
There are also other ways to buy and sell securities.

135
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,470
These are called, broadly, alternative trading systems.

136
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,830
These include electronic communication networks,

137
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,790
which provide trading venues outside of the exchanges.

138
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,250
They include dark pools and so forth.

139
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,410
These types of trading venues are not exchanges.

140
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,340
They're not subject to the exact same regulations.

141
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,710
They still are subject to regulatory oversight,

142
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,180
but the rules are different.

143
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,000
They typically register them as broker dealers,

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,800
and they're not required to provide

145
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,920
the same level of transparency, for example, as exchanges do.

146
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,290
They also tend to operate during other hours

147
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,850
when exchange may be closed, alternative training venues

148
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,610
would be open, and they generally

149
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,290
have different economic trade offs, different cost structure.

150
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,830
A significant fraction of trading

151
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,370
nowadays goes through these alternative trading venues.

152
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,830
As you can see from the graph, as you

153
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,300
look at the distribution of trading

154
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,510
across the largest exchanges, the stock market

155
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,340
nowadays is highly fragmented.

156
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,970
There are many competing players, and none of them

157
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,110
dominates the market in terms of the trading volume.

158
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,950
There are several leading exchanges.

159
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,620
Some of them are owned by the NYSE group.

160
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,930
Some are owned by CBOE.

161
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,640
They may conduct 5%, 10% of the daily volume of trade,

162
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,970
on average, in various securities, but none of them

163
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,170
control the majority of trading in the equity market.

164
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,650
Over time, the volume of trading has been rising.

165
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,020
If you look over the 30 year period from 1984 until now,

166
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,740
the overall volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange

167
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,680
increased almost tenfold.

168
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,080
Part of this increase can be explained by the fact

169
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,540
that the overall market is growing,

170
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,940
and that can be seen from the rising level of the stock

171
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,174
market index.

172
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:37,299
That's not the whole story.

173
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,950
However, trading nowadays is largely electronic,

174
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,190
and the volume of trading has been rising sharply

175
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,930
over the last two decades.

176
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,520
And this partly reflects the rise of high frequency trading

177
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,150
strategies, which accounts for a significant fraction of trading

178
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,500
volume in equity markets.

179
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,000
