00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,410
LEONID KOGAN: I am Leonid Kogan.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,577
JIANG WANG: I am Jiang Wang.

3
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:06,370
Welcome to Foundations of Modern Finance.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,692
We are the instructors for this course.

5
00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:10,150
LEONID KOGAN: In this course, we'll

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,910
introduce you to the core principles and some

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,570
of the most important techniques in modern finance.

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,360
The global financial system is complex

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,150
with multiple participants including households,

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,490
businesses, financial intermediaries,

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,770
and the governments, among others.

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,950
Yet, the diverse problems faced by these actors

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,439
can be understood and addressed using a unifying

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,030
framework and a relatively small set of fundamental principles.

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,560
This framework forms the foundation of modern finance,

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,420
and it is our purpose in this class

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,270
to equip you with the concepts and tools necessary to handle

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,090
a wide range of financial problems.

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,910
JIANG WANG: Here, we would like to give a brief description

20
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,620
about the structure and content of the course.

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,380
Part one of the course has four sections.

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,800
Section A provides an introduction to finance.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,340
Sections B, C, and D then cover the basics

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,790
of financial market, risk analysis and evaluation,

25
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,070
and corporate finance.

26
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,250
The introductory section provides the foundation

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,810
for the whole course.

28
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,430
In lecture 1, we will develop a comprehensive and coherent

29
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,180
analytical framework to formulate

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,580
the fundamental financial challenges firms and households

31
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,850
face and lay down the general principles we

32
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,060
will use to tackle them.

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,480
In lecture 2, we will establish the key idea

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,430
in solving the central problem in finance,

35
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,610
which is how to value assets, cash rolls and projects.

36
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,090
In particular, we will develop a general methodology

37
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,470
for asset valuation, the arbitrage pricing approach,

38
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,570
by using prices of assets traded in the financial market.

39
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,690
We will then further develop this general asset valuation

40
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,220
methodology into powerful tools for the pricing of assets

41
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,600
or cash flows--

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,230
in particular, how to use the appropriate discount

43
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,110
rate properly adjusted for timing and risk

44
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,490
to obtain the present value of a cash flow.

45
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,290
LEONID KOGAN: In part B, we introduce

46
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,230
some of the largest and most important financial markets

47
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,300
and securities, fixed income securities and common stocks.

48
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,340
We discuss the main characteristics

49
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,670
of these securities and the markets where they trade.

50
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,620
We then develop valuation techniques

51
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,520
for fixed income assets and for equities.

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,730
Although these assets are quite different in their properties,

53
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,560
our approach to their valuation is

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,500
based on the same fundamental principle.

55
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,980
We value financial securities relative to other assets,

56
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,720
based on the principle of absence

57
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,170
of arbitrage or no free lunch.

58
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,000
We maintain this common perspective

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,050
as we explore some of the topics specific to each asset class,

60
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,380
such as bond duration or forecasting of stock dividends.

61
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,310
By the end of this section, you will learn the principles

62
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,910
and the core valuation methods used in fixed income and equity

63
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,890
markets.

64
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,370
In section C, we explore the notion of risk

65
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,460
which is central to many problems in finance.

66
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,940
In lecture 6, we'll look at how to model investment decisions

67
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,000
under uncertainty and how to measure risk quantitatively.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,710
We introduce modern portfolio theory and risk management

69
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,990
through diversification.

70
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,900
In lecture 7, we introduce the arbitrage pricing theory,

71
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,950
which is a powerful framework for pricing for national assets

72
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,230
based on their risk profile.

73
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,850
This pricing framework is heavily

74
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,090
used across financial markets, including both equity

75
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,480
and fixed-income markets.

76
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,960
In lecture 8, we introduce the fundamental important concept

77
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,970
of market efficiency.

78
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,890
The concept of market efficiency refers

79
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,920
to the ability of markets to incorporate information

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,780
into prices.

81
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,510
This concept is central to modern finance

82
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,790
and connects to numerous other topics,

83
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,840
from firm financial policies to asset management.

84
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,200
In this lecture, we define the notion of market efficiency

85
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,709
and discuss its uses and limitations, as well as

86
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,790
relevant empirical evidence.

87
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,770
JIANG WANG: The last section of part 1

88
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,820
lays the foundation for modern corporate finance.

89
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,660
In lecture 9, we will establish value maximization

90
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,770
as the main goal in corporate financial decision making.

91
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,260
We will then apply the general framework

92
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,220
for financial analysis to major corporate financial decisions,

93
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,700
including capital budgeting, financing, payout,

94
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,980
and risk management.

95
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,270
Lecture 10 focuses on the real investment or capital budgeting

96
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,200
decisions of the firm, its most fundamental and important

97
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,030
decisions.

98
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,480
Here, we apply the asset valuation tools developed

99
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,320
earlier in the course to project valuation and capital

100
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,420
budgeting.

101
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,270
LEONID KOGAN: I have received my PhD in finance from MIT,

102
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,640
and I have been teaching here for the past 20 years

103
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,940
in various programs, including the Master of Finance,

104
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,930
the MBA, the Doctoral Program, and Executive Education.

105
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,940
The scope of my teaching at MIT includes

106
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,960
the Foundations course, on which this online class is based,

107
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,430
as well as advanced electives and doctoral courses

108
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,020
on capital markets and financial engineering.

109
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,270
My research spans a range of topics

110
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,780
in asset pricing, macro finance, and financial engineering.

111
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,780
JIANG WANG: Let me say a few words about myself.

112
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,180
I'm the Mizuho Financial Group professor

113
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,120
at MIT, where I have been for over 30 years.

114
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,260
I've taught various finance courses in the MBA,

115
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,530
Master of Finance, PhD, and executive programs

116
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,490
at Sloan, including introductory courses, like this one,

117
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,540
for many years.

118
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,720
My research is mostly in the area

119
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,940
of asset pricing, investment and risk

120
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,580
management, financial regulation,

121
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,010
and international finance.

122
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,640
We will be working together with you throughout this course

123
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,420
and hope you will enjoy it.
