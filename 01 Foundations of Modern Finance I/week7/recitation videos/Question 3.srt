1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,950
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,700
learn how to identify arbitrage opportunities.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,300
in the context of factor models.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,720
We will consider two factor models and three

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,230
well-diversified portfolios, A, B, and C with the following

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,420
characteristics.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,060
This table gives us expected returns and factor loadings

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:28,480
on the first and second factor for the three portfolios.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,710
We'll construct an arbitrage strategy,

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,910
such that generates $1,000 today and has

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,860
zero payoff in the future.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,310
We will assume that there is a risk-free instrument.

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,660
And the current risk-free rate is 1.5%.

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,560
Let us start constructing our arbitrage strategy by assuming

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,920
that we buy or go long portfolios A, B,

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,100
and C, as well as the risk-free bonds

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,660
in the following amounts, XA, XB, XC, and Xrf.

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,430
This will be the dollar amount that

19
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,400
was spent on these securities.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,420
We will allow these amounts to be negative,

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,250
which would indicate that we are shorting these securities.

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,220
So this table summarizes our positions.

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,800
So in the last column, I indicate the amounts

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,390
that we invest in each of these four securities.

25
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,870
And at the bottom, I put the risk-free bond.

26
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,590
And I put the expected return, which is 1.5%.

27
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,170
And, of course, the factor exposures

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,130
on both factors for the risk-free security are zeros.

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,280
Recall that we want to construct a trading strategy that

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,130
gives us $1,000 today.

31
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,730
So therefore, we can write down the following equation.

32
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,310
So the money that we spend right now

33
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,710
on taking positions in these four securities

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,010
should equal to $1,000.

35
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,010
So notice the negative signs on all X's here,

36
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,040
because we assumed that we are buying

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,390
all of these four securities.

38
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,060
Now, of course, we can immediately

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,680
see that some of these X's have to be negative.

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,650
In other words, we have to be shorting

41
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,790
some of these securities.

42
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,580
Otherwise, there is no possibility

43
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,150
that we would earn a positive $1,000.

44
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,780
Now what does arbitrage mean in this particular context?

45
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,770
Number one, it means that our expected returns

46
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,400
from our portfolio will be 0.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,170
Two, it means that we have no exposure to systematic risk.

48
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,940
And three, since we are working with

49
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,960
well-diversified portfolios, which by construction have

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,095
no idiosyncratic risk, it means that we do not have exposure

51
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:46,470
to idiosyncratic risk, because we

52
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,920
are working with three well-diversified portfolios

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,070
and with a risk-free bond.

54
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,040
So as long as all of these three conditions are satisfied

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,050
and the third one is satisfied by construction,

56
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,230
so as long as the first two are satisfied,

57
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,740
it means we will have arbitrage opportunity in this market.

58
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,940
Let's start with the first condition, zero expected

59
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,830
return.

60
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,940
The equation that is written here indicates that the future

61
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,790
value of our portfolio is $0.00, which means that we are earning

62
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,030
0% expected return.

63
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,160
The first part of this equation for example

64
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,150
XA times 1 plus expected the return on portfolio A,

65
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,340
this is just the future value of portfolio A. Similarly,

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,170
XB is the dollar value that we invested in portfolio

67
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,240
B, that is one plan plus expected return portfolio B,

68
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,920
is the future value of this portfolio

69
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,580
and so similarly for portfolio C and similarly

70
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,780
for the risk-free bond.

71
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,850
If we plug-in the numbers that were given in this question,

72
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,710
so we know the expected returns on the three portfolios,

73
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,620
and we know that the risk-free rate is 1.5%,

74
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,750
this gives us this equation.

75
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,080
So this is an equation with four unknowns-- so

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,390
our X's, XA, XB, XC, and Xrf.

77
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,030
Now the second arbitrage condition

78
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,709
is that we have no exposure to systematic risk.

79
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,370
In this particular model, we have two systematic risk

80
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,290
factors, 1 and 2.

81
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,270
And so this would mean that we have no exposure

82
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,990
to both of these systematic risk factors.

83
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,960
Technically speaking, it means that the factor loadings

84
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,430
of our portfolio on both of these factors should be 0.

85
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,850
And so this is the first equation.

86
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,050
So the factor loadings of the portfolio P on factor 1 is 0.

87
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,390
We can expand and write this down,

88
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,360
because the beta of the portfolio P

89
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,980
is the weighted average of the betas of the portfolios A, B,

90
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,450
and C here.

91
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,410
Recall that, of course, the beta of the risk-free bond is 0.

92
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,677
So it is 0 here.

93
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,760
With P in this equation, it's just the total value

94
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,750
of the portfolio.

95
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,610
And so, therefore, we have this equation.

96
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,250
So weighted average of the betas of well-diversified portfolio

97
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,510
A, B, and C should equal to 0.

98
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,560
We can see that the total value of portfolio VP cancels out.

99
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
So it's irrelevant here.

100
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,018
And so, therefore, we are left with the following equation.

101
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:31,940
So beta 1 of portfolio A, which is 0.95 multiplied by XA,

102
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,490
plus factor loading of portfolio B on the first factor, which

103
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,460
is 0.85 times XB plus the factor loading of portfolio

104
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,490
C on the first factor 1.2 times XC.

105
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,470
So this should equal to 0.

106
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,490
Similarly, we can write down exactly the same equation

107
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,080
for the second risk factor.

108
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,460
So this is the equation.

109
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,940
So the only thing that changes here,

110
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,970
the fact that all of these betas are the factor loadings

111
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:11,080
of portfolios A, B, and C on the second risk factor.

112
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,400
And so plugging in the betas of each of these portfolios,

113
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,115
we get this equation.

114
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:20,070


115
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,070
We now can combine all of the equations into one system.

116
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,960
We have a system of four equations and four unknowns.

117
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,530
The first equation says that we're making $1,000 today.

118
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,860
The second equation says that we have $0.00 and 0% expected

119
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,030
return.

120
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,640
And the third and fourth equation

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,920
says that we have no systematic exposure

122
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,280
to the first and second risk factor.

123
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,490
Now, we already learned how to solve

124
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,860
a system of linear equations in Excel, for example.

125
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,770
Refer to recitation number four question 2.

126
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,830
So repeating the same steps, we can solve this

127
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,680
and get the following answer.

128
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,840
So XA is going to be equal to negative $235,480.

129
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,770
XB would equal to $24,360.

130
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,980
XC equals the $169,167.

131
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:28,730
And Xrf equals to $40,953.

132
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:35,030
This means that we are going short portfolio A.

133
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,430
And we are buying portfolios B and C

134
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,890
and also buying the risk-free bond.

135
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,320
So this effectively means that portfolio A

136
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,980
had too low of an expected return

137
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,740
given its systematic risk.

138
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,860
And so, therefore, we're shorting that portfolio.

139
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,810
And we're buying portfolios B and C. Importantly,

140
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,170
this illustrates the fact that to avoid arbitrage

141
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,640
opportunities in the market, expected returns

142
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,640
on well-diversified portfolios, and their exposure

143
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,890
to systematic risk should be consistent with one another.

144
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,750
Otherwise, as it's illustrated here,

145
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,450
there will be an arbitrage opportunity.

146
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,420
And this condition that guarantees

147
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,390
no arbitrage in this market is what

148
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,440
gives us the APT pricing equation, which

149
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,409
is a very important result.

150
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,000
