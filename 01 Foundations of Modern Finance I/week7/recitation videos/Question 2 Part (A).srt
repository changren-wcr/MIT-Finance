1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,480
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,170
work with a large portfolio of stocks

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,215
with the goal to understand what happens to the idiosyncratic,

4
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:12,470
the risk of a portfolio as the number of stocks

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,970
in the portfolio increases.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,400
We will start with a portfolio that consists of 30 stocks.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,890
We will work with in the framework of a two factor

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,210
model.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,340
And we have the following factor loadings and standard deviation

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,170
of idiosyncratic risk for individual assets for these 30

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,400
stocks.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,870
So the factor loading on the first factor, beta 1,

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,350
for each of the assets, for each of the 30 stocks, equals to 1.

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,210
Now the factor loading on the second factor for these 30

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,570
stocks will differ.

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,640
So for the first 10 stocks, from i from 1 to 10,

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,950
the factor loading will be 1.

18
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,730
For the next 10 stocks, from i equals to 11 to 20,

19
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,480
the vector loading will be 1.6.

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,540
And for the remaining 10 stocks from 21 to 30,

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,740
the factor loading on the second factor will be 2.1.

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,540
This is the idiosyncratic risk of our individual stocks.

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,610
For the first 10 stocks, idiosyncratic standard

24
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,160
deviation is 5%.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,320
For the next 10 stocks, from 11 to 20, it's 6%.

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,450
And for the remaining 10 stocks, it is 8%.

27
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,000
So first, what we will do here is

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,050
that we'll form an equally weighted portfolio out

29
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,580
of these 10 stocks.

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,080
And in the first question, we'll try

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,455
to understand what are the factor

32
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:42,540
loadings on factor 1 and 2, in this equally

33
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,950
weighted portfolio.

34
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,990
Let's compute factor loadings of this equally

35
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,580
weighted portfolio.

36
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,250
Let's start with the factor loading 1 or beta 1,

37
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,720
of portfolio p.

38
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,900
By definition, this is just the weighted average

39
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,430
of betas of individual assets in our portfolio.

40
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,700
The weights are the weights of each of the individual assets

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,360
in the portfolio.

42
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,840
So all of our w's, would just simply equal to 1 over n1,

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,120
where n1 is the number of stocks, 30,

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,300
because we're working with equally weighted portfolios.

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,910
And so therefore, this expression

46
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,920
becomes just the sum from 1 all the way to 30

47
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,790
to the number of stocks, 1 over n1,

48
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,540
which is the weight of each individual stock, multiplied

49
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,170
by the beta of individual stocks in this portfolio.

50
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,220
Now recall that of beta, all of the loadings,

51
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,850
so if individual stocks on factor 1,

52
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,040
is just simply equal to 1.

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,780
So all of this beta i1, they're equal to 1.

54
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,710
And so therefore, the sum becomes just this.

55
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,670
So we're adding up from 1 to 30, 1 over 30.

56
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,605
So this just gives us 1.

57
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,480
And you could see that this is very intuitive

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,930
because each individual stock is beta

59
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,630
that it goes to 1 with respect to the first factor.

60
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,640
So for equally weighted portfolio,

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,340
for that matter, for any portfolio that we form out

62
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,720
of these assets, the beta, 1, of this portfolio

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,780
will always be equal to 1, just because individual assets, all

64
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,980
of them have betas equal to 1.

65
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,613
Now for beta 2 of the portfolio is

66
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:20,030
going to be a little bit different

67
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,420
because individual stocks have different loadings

68
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,530
on the second factor here.

69
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,200
So let's compute it.

70
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,530
Same expression, this is just definition.

71
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,600
Equally weighted portfolio, so all of our wi's are 1 over n1.

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,130
And now we are adding up all of these beta, i2.

73
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,710
So we have 10 stocks for which beta i2 is 1.

74
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,660
So 10 times 1.

75
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,490
The other 10 stocks of which beta 2 is 1.6.

76
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,470
So 10 times 1.6 plus 10 times 2.1.

77
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,610
So this is the beta for the last 30 stocks in this portfolio.

78
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,900
So if we add up all this, we divided by 30.

79
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,520
Again, so this is the number of stocks.

80
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,160
So this expression would equal to 1.57.

81
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,430
So the loading on the second factor of this portfolio p,

82
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,020
equally weighted portfolio, would equal to 1.57.

83
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,000
