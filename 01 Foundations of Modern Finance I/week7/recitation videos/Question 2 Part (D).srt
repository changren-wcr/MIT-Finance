1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,500
PROFESSOR: Now let's see what happens to the idiosyncratic

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,610
volatility of a portfolio as we increase the number of stocks.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,150
We will increase it from 30 to 300

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,360
and we'll compute the idiosyncratic volatility, again

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,370
of this equally weighted portfolio.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,300
I will maintain the assumption that the first 100 stocks have

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,120
idiosyncratic volatility of 5%, the next 100 stocks 6%,

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,370
and the remaining 100 stocks of 8%.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,670
So this is a standard deviation of epsilon I

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,530
of these individual stocks.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,130
Now let's see what changes in the expression

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,510
that we've had before.

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,260
So one thing that changes is n1, so instead of 30, it

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,590
becomes 300 and so I'm raising, I'm

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,580
squaring 300 right now instead of 30.

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,190
And now I'm adding up instead of adding up

17
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,850
30 idiosyncratic variances, I'm adding

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,570
up 300 idiosyncratic variances because I have 300 stocks.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,990
And so the first 100 stocks have idiosyncratic variance

20
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,519
of 5% squared.

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,170
So the remaining, or the next 100 stocks 6%

22
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,250
squared, and the last 100 stocks 8% squared.

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,618
So adding this all up gives me this variance.

24
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,160
You can see that already this variance is quite a bit smaller

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,320
than this one because it has an extra 0 here.

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,600
And so now if I compute the volatility

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,870
of the standard deviation of this portfolio P,

28
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,200
by taking the square root of the variance that I just computed,

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,390
this gives me 0.37%.

30
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,740
So you could see that the variance dropped quite sharply

31
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,690
from 1.18% for a portfolio that had 30 stocks,

32
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:47,990
to 0.37% for a portfolio that has 300 stocks.

33
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,740
And so the key lesson here is that it's exactly this drop.

34
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,680
In the limit we know that idiosyncratic volatility

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,150
of the portfolio, of equally weighted portfolio,

36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,750
is going to go to zero.

37
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,290
You can see here that if I increase n1 to further

38
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,060
to 3,000, again, maintaining the same assumption here,

39
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,000
the volatility of this equally weighted portfolio

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,610
is going to drop further to 0.12%.

41
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,050
So if we continue increasing, it's going to go down,

42
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,080
it's going to go down to 0.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,580
And this is the key lesson of this example.
