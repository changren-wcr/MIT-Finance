00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,500
PROFESSOR: Let's find idiosyncratic volatility

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,260
of an equally weighted portfolio.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,190
So we're after standard deviation of epsilon P

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,722
and we'll start with the variance

5
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:12,430
and then we'll take the square root of it

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,600
to find the standard deviation.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,990
So let's start with the variance.

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,810
By definition since idiosyncratic risks

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,890
of individual assets are uncorrelated,

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,600
the variance or idiosyncratic risk of the portfolio P

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,960
would equal to the sum of the individual idiosyncratic

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,640
variances of each individual stocks, multiplied

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,360
by the squared weights that we have in the portfolio.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,760
And so recall that again, all Wis are just 1 over 30,

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,390
or 1 over n1, and so therefore, each of these wi squared, which

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,610
is equal to 1 over n1 squared.

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,450
And now what we are left with is just

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,137
the sum of idiosyncratic variances of individual stocks.

19
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:03,220
And this is the structure.

20
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,303
So the first 10 stocks have the standard deviation

21
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:08,620
of 5%, idiosyncratic standard deviation of 5%.

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,300
The next 10 stocks 6% and the remaining 10 stocks 8%.

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,700
So if we add up all of them.

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,350
So we get 10 times 5% squared, so this is the variance

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,570
of these first 10 stocks.

26
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,660
Then 10 times 6% squared, so this is the total variance

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,820
of the second stocks.

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,810
And then 10 times 8% squared, so this is the variance

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,480
of the remaining 10 stocks.

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,800
Again, so n1 equals t0 30, so 1 over 30 squared,

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,610
putting this all together gives us 0.00014.

32
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,600
And so this is the variance or idiosyncratic variance

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,850
of this portfolio P.

34
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,870
To find the standard deviation, we're

35
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,190
just taking the square root of this number that we found here

36
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,500
and we get number 1.18%.

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,370
So the idiosyncratic volatility of this equally

38
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,610
weighted portfolio P equals to 1.18%.

39
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,270
Notice how much lower it is compared

40
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,330
to the individual idiosyncratic variances

41
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,860
of each individual assets.

42
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,950
The lowest one is 5% and so this portfolio right now

43
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,040
has very low variance, idiosyncratic variance

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,190
of just 1.18%.
