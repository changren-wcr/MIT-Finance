00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,980
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:09,550
learn how to find factor risk premia or factor risk prices.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,440
Let's consider the following three factor model.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,600
We are given four well-diversified portfolios--

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,370
A, B, C, and D--

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,300
with the following characteristics.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,980
So we are given the expected returns and factor loadings

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,850
on all three factors.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,530
So now, given this information, in particular the returns

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,920
and factor loadings, the goal is to find factor risk

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,185
premia for all three factors.

12
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:40,230


13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,500
We can start with APT pricing equation that tells us

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,450
that the expected excess return on a portfolio p

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,350
should equal to the factor risk premia multiplied

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,390
by their factor loadings.

17
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,270
So for example, in our case, when we have three factor

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,320
model, it's the price of the first factor

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,220
lambda 1 multiplied by the loading on this first factor

20
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,070
of portfolio p, so beta p1.

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,220
Plus the price of the second risk factor

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,500
multiplied by the loading of this portfolio

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,110
p on the second risk factor, plus the price

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,860
of the third risk factor times the loading.

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,922
So we can write this down specifically for portfolio A.

26
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:26,380
So in this case, it's going to be expected return portfolio

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,580
A minus the risk-free rate, equals to, again,

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,590
the prices of the factors multiplied

29
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:38,990
by the risk exposure of this portfolio A to these factors.

30
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,170
So more specifically, we can plug in the numbers

31
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,628
that we are given in this question.

32
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:46,510
So for portfolio A, the expected return was 21.65%.

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:52,750
And the factor loadings were 0.95 from the first factor,

34
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,160
1.2 on the second, and 0.85 on the third.

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,140
And now, what we can do, we can write down

36
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,120
the same exact equations for the remaining three portfolios.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,930
So here, we have four equations written

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,770
for each of the portfolios.

39
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,810
And so these are the APT pricing equations.

40
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,950
And so if we look at this carefully,

41
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,970
we will see that we have four equations and four unknowns.

42
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,560
Therefore, we can write down the following system of equations.

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,690
We can write down the system of equations

44
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,300
in the following matrix form.

45
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,070
And now, all we have to do is we have

46
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,120
to solve this equation for the three lambdas, which, again,

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,930
the prices of the three corresponding risk factors

48
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,430
and the risk-free rate.

49
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,830
So solving this equation gives us the following numbers.

50
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,850
So the price of the first risk factor is 6.5%.

51
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,420
The price of the second risk factor is 10%.

52
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,200
The price of the third risk factor is 3.5%.

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,460
And the risk-free rate here is 0.5%.

54
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,500
And this is how you find factor risk

55
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,670
premia from known expected returns and factor loadings.

56
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,280
Notice that, in this case, we have a three factor model,

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,850
and we don't know risk-free rate.

58
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,920
So therefore, we need expected the returns and factor loadings

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,640
on at least four well-diversified portfolios

60
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,840
to find all the risk premia and the risk-free rate.

61
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,740
If we were already given the risk-free rate,

62
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,640
we only needed three well-diversified portfolios

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,200
to find factor risk premia.

64
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Now, finally, once we know the factor risk

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,030
premia and the risk-free rate in this economy,

66
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,700
we can price all the other well-diversified portfolios

67
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,930
as long as we know their factor loadings.

68
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,020
And knowing the factor loadings and the factor risk premia,

69
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,470
we should be able to find their expected returns.
