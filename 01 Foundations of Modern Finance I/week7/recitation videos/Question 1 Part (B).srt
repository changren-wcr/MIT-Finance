00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,660
PROFESSOR: Let's compute correlation

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,700
between the returns on stock A and stock

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,420
B. I will start with the covariance.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,880
So the covariance between returns on stock A and stock

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,310
B will be given by this expression.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,520
I got this expression by taking the expression

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,960
that we get from the factor model

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,620
from the return structure.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,330
So the return on stock A is given by this equation and so

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,030
the return for stock B.

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,030
The first, so this expected value is not

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,530
going to matter because this is just

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,160
a scalar and the idiosyncratic component epsilon

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,720
is not going to matter here as well for the covariance term

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,080
because by definition the covariance between returns

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,410
on stock A and B is 0 [NOTE: Professor meant covariance between idiosyncratic components of returns], is just the definition

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,040
of idiosyncratic risk.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,580
And there is no correlation between factor returns

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,700
and idiosyncratic risk for either of the two stocks.

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,790
Again, just by the definition of what is factor return

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,380
and what is the idiosyncratic risk.

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,310
And so therefore, we are left with the following expressions,

23
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,710
so the covariance of the returns on stock A and B

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,920
would be given by just effectively these two

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,459
expressions.

26
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:09,230
So for the first stock we get beta A with respect

27
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,840
to factor 1, multiplied by f1, then the second beta multiplied

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,960
by factor 2.

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,640
And for stock B we get beta B1 multiplied by f1 and beta B2

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,250
multiplied by f2.

31
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,340
Now this covariance in turn is going

32
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,640
to equal to this simple expression for the reason

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,460
that again we're assuming that the returns in factor f1 and f2

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,610
are uncorrelated, so the covariance is 0.

35
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,290
If it is not, then this expression,

36
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,830
we will have to take into account this covariance as

37
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,210
well.

38
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,880
Again, assuming that this is 0, so what's left

39
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,780
is just simply the variance of f1 multiplied by the factor

40
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,820
loadings of stock A and B on factor 1, so beta A1,

41
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,090
beta B1 multiplied by the variance of f1,

42
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,810
plus the same for the second factor.

43
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,830
So beta A2 times beta B2, multiplied

44
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,890
by the variance of factor f2.

45
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,190
Computing this, again, so we know betas,

46
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,750
we know the variances of factor of f1 and f2.

47
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,880
So this gives us 0.021.

48
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,018
And so this is the covariance.

49
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,560
The final step is take the covariance

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,350
and compute the correlation.

51
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,610
Correlation by definition equals to the covariance

52
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,790
of returns on A and B divided by their standard deviations.

53
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,350
We have computed standard deviations

54
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,370
in the first part of this question

55
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,810
so we know these numbers.

56
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,050
So we're taking this covariance that we just

57
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,960
computed, dividing it by the standard deviation

58
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,940
that we computed in part A and this gives me 0.341.

59
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,940
So therefore the correlation between the returns

60
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,500
on stock A and stock B is 34%.

61
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,000
