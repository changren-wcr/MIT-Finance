1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,680
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will work with data

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,650
and we will learn how to implement arbitrage pricing

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,350
theory model in practice.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,090
We will consider a two factor model

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,480
that has the market and the price of gold as the risk

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,310
factors.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,530
The price of gold can be a risk factor in its own.

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,070
Or it can correlate with other risk factors.

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,050
For example, inflation.

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,850
To proxy for these two risk factors,

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,460
we will use factor mimicking portfolios.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,480
For the market factor, we will use the returns

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,160
on the market portfolio.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,250
And for the price of gold, we will use the returns

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,090
on the Spider Gold Shares ETF.

16
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,650
On your screen, you can see a snippet

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,130
from the fact sheet of this ETF, which is traded

18
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,400
under the ticker symbol GLD.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,690
We will implement this model by using returns on eight firms.

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,860
Four of these firms up from the gold mining industry.

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,790
And the other four are from the technology industry.

22
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,610
These firms are listed on your screen.

23
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,100
In this file, I have monthly return data

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,470
on each of these eight stocks.

25
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,390
So for each of them, the sample covers January 2005 all the way

26
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,580
through December 2019.

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,940
So for each of these stocks, we have 15 years

28
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,710
worth of monthly return data.

29
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,120
So the return for a given month on each of the stocks

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,900
is given in column C. The column next to it,

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,370
column D contains the risk free rates.

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,150
Column E contains the return on the market portfolio.

33
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:36,400
And column F contains the returns on the GLD ETF.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,220
And all of this data is organized by firm.

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,620
So this is the first firm, then I have the second firm

36
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,230
and so forth.

37
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,530
So I have eight of these blocks corresponding

38
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,700
to each of the stocks.

39
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,520
Now, recall that, to implement the APT model

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,910
in our particular case where we have two risk factors--

41
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,980
the market and the price of gold--

42
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,060
we have to run the following regression.

43
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,170
So we have to regress the excess return

44
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,130
on the excess return on the market portfolio

45
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,040
and the excess return on the gold ETF.

46
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,800
And this regression has to include the constant, as well.

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,810
So therefore, to run this regression,

48
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,480
first I am computing excess return on each of the stocks

49
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,160
by taking the return and subtracting the risk free rate.

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,560
Next, I'm computing the excess market return

51
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,660
where I'm taking the return on the market portfolio.

52
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,810
And again, subtracting the risk free rate.

53
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,630
And then I'm doing the same thing for the GLD ETF.

54
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,530
So I'm computing the excess return on this ETF

55
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,350
by taking its return and subtracting the risk free rate.

56
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,100
Now, we are ready to run this regression.

57
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,100
There are several ways of running linear regression

58
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,000
in Excel.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,920
I'm going to be using a function that is called LINEST.

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,650
So because this is a multiple regression,

61
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,930
I will be estimating three coefficients.

62
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,320
So the lowering on each of the two risk

63
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,472
factors and a constant.

64
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,430
So the way I'm going to implement this function

65
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,640
is it's an array function.

66
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,878
So I am highlighting these three cells

67
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:17,170
and I will write the following.

68
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,640
So I'll say LINEST.

69
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,220
And the first input into this function

70
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,150
would be the left hand side variable,

71
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,250
which is our excess return on the stock.

72
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,100
So this column.

73
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,810
And the next input will be the metrics of the right hand side

74
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,120
variables, which would be these two.

75
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,890


76
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,400
Then for constant and for statistics, I will say yes.

77
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,940
Because I do want to have a constant estimated,

78
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,820
because this is the way to run this regression.

79
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,875
And then I will also say 1 for the loss parameter.

80
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,750
And then recall that this is a rate function.

81
00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:00,400
So I have to hit Shift, Control, and Enter at the same time.

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,910
Now, notice that the way this function works is it

83
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,420
actually gives the estimate of the coefficients

84
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,480
from this regression as the lost number.

85
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,570
And the first number is actually in the reverse order of the way

86
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,310
they appear in the matrix.

87
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,600
So the first estimate is the estimate on gold.

88
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,560
And the second is the estimate on the market.

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
Now let's estimate this regression

90
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,880
for the remaining firms.

91
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,050
I'll show you how to estimate it for the next firm.

92
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,300
And then, I will let you do the rest of the exercise yourself.

93
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,420
So I'm, again, highlighting the three cells.

94
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,210
I'm writing LINEST.

95
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,450
I'm going down to the portion of the file

96
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,440
where half the returns in the corresponding stock.

97
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,600
So I'm highlighting my y's first.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,460
Next, I'm highlighting my x's.

99
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,110
So it's these two columns.

100
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,690
Then I'll say 1 and 1.

101
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,550
And then I will hit Shift, Control, Enter.

102
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,450
And you will see that this process estimates

103
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,850
the coefficients again on gold market and the intercept.

104
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,120
Now I have estimated all eight regressions

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,710
and these are the results.

106
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,600
So these are the loadings on the gold factor for gold mining

107
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,100
companies.

108
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,993
And these are the loadings on the market factor.

109
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,660
These are the loadings of the technology

110
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,960
stocks and the gold factor.

111
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,793
And these are the loadings of the technology

112
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:33,860
stocks on the market factor.

113
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,940
Next, let's average the factor loadings for gold mining stocks

114
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,980
and for technology stocks.

115
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,350
What I'm doing in this highlighted table

116
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,780
is I'm averaging the loadings of the gold stocks

117
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,940
on this first gold factor.

118
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,310
And the second number here is the average

119
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,740
of the loadings on the market factor.

120
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,310
Down below, this is the average of the loadings of the tech

121
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,110
stocks on the gold factor.

122
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,030
And this is the average of their loadings on the market factor.

123
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,240
Now, let's think and interpret these results.

124
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,090
First, notice that the loading of gold mining

125
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,250
stocks on the gold risk factor is large and positive.

126
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,490
This should make economic sense because, when the price of gold

127
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,890
goes up, presumably these companies

128
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,390
can generate higher revenue.

129
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,380
And, therefore, investors reward these firms

130
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,590
with higher returns.

131
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,500
For technology stocks, this loading

132
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,910
is negative, which means that, when the prices of gold

133
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,650
go down, on average the returns on technology stocks

134
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,910
go up and vice versa.

135
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,580
The loading of the technology stocks on the market risk

136
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,560
factor is close to 1, which means

137
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,540
that, if the stock market goes up by 1%, on average

138
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,350
the technology stocks go up by 1%, as well.

139
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,760
And the loading of gold mining stocks on the market risk

140
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,370
factor is around 0.2, which means

141
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,490
that they have much lower sensitivity of their returns

142
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,720
with respect to the market risk factor.
