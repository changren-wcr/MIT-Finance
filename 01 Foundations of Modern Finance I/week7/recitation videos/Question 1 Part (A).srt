1
00:00:00,772 --> 00:00:02,980
PROFESSOR: In this question, we will consider

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,000
a frame over a factor model.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,790
And I will teach you how to compute standard deviations

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,490
and correlations of returns on individual assets

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,600
or individual stocks.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,720
We will start with a two-factor model.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,420
So the volatility of the first factor,

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,860
or the standard deviation of factor 1 is 7%.

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,540
The volatility of the second factor is 5%.

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,820
There are two stocks, A and B. Stock A

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,110
has the following loadings.

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,940
So it has a loading of 1 on factor 1 and loading of 1.5

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,770
on factor 2.

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,990
The idiosyncratic volatility of the stock A is 25%.

15
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:44,270
Stock B has loading of 2, or its beta on the first factor

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,350
equals to 2.

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,340
And the loading on factor 2 equals to 3.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,510
The idiosyncratic risk of the volatility of the stock B

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,650
is 10%.

20
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,830
In the first question, we'll compute the standard deviations

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,870
of returns of these two stocks, so stock A and stock B. Let's

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,660
start with writing down the expression for the variance

23
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,540
of returns on stock A. The returns on stock A

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,770
are given by the following, again, factor

25
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,610
model, the following expression.

26
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,580
So we need to compute the variance of this.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,580
So this is a scalar because this is the expected

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,160
value of random variable ri.

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,528
So the variance of this is going to be 0.

30
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:27,570
So then we are left with these three expressions.

31
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,040
So we will have the variances of these individual terms

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,992
plus the pairwise covariances.

33
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,450
So let's start with the first term.

34
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,240
So the variance of this is going to be equal to beta,

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,570
or the first loading, beta 1 squared,

36
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,580
multiplied by the variance of the first factor of 1

37
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,580
plus the second beta, the second loading squared multiplied

38
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,340
by this variance, plus the variance

39
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,530
of these idiosyncratic components, so idiosyncratic

40
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,110
risk--

41
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,902
so this is the last part here-- so variance

42
00:01:56,902 --> 00:02:01,350
of epsilon A, plus pairwise correlations.

43
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,710
So the first one would be the covariance between the returns

44
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,509
on factor 1 and factor 2.

45
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:12,620
So this is 2 times the betas times the covariance

46
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,886
between the returns on factor 1 and the returns on factor 2.

47
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,520
And plus the covariance is between f1

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,060
and the idiosyncratic risk of stock A,

49
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,480
so epsilon A, and f2 and epsilon 2.

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,390
Now by construction, remember that this is a factor model.

51
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,000
So by definition, the covariance is

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,270
between the returns and factors and idiosyncratic risk.

53
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,350
This is why it is idiosyncratic risk.

54
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,980
So this covariance, it will be 0.

55
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,510
Now in addition to this--

56
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,280
so recall that when we discussed this in the lecture,

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,810
we said that in theory, returns and factors, of course,

58
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,370
could be correlated.

59
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,960
But here we'll assume that this covariance would equal to 0.

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,050
So that the returns on factors f1

61
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,160
and f2 in this particular example would be uncorrelated.

62
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,430
So I'll get rid of this term.

63
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,780
Now, let's compute the variance of returns on stock A.

64
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,420
Since we assume that the covariance or the correlation

65
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,050
between the returns on factor 1 and 2

66
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,080
is 0, so these two factors are uncorrelated,

67
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,405
we are left with just these three terms.

68
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:20,030
So to compute the variance for stock A,

69
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,420
we're taking first beta or the loading on the first factor,

70
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,820
squaring it, so 1 squared, multiply it

71
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,360
by the variance of the first factor.

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,940
So we're given a standard deviation, 7%.

73
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,940
So we're squaring the 7%.

74
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,250
Plus we have the second beta, 1.5, square it,

75
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,140
multiplying it by the variance of the second factor,

76
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,210
this is the standard deviation that we are given, squared.

77
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,600
Plus the variance of the idiosyncratic risk of stock A,

78
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,230
this is 25% squared.

79
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,780
Computing this gives us 0.073%.

80
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,160
So this is the variance.

81
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,470
To find the standard deviation of the returns on the stock A,

82
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,240
we are taking the square root of this variance, square root

83
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,560
of 0.073.

84
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,560
And this gives us 27%.

85
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,090
So therefore, the volatility of the returns on this stock A

86
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,850
is 27%.

87
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,640
We can repeat this calculation for stock B.

88
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,240
So it's exactly the same expression.

89
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,160
So I take the first beta or the loading on the first factor,

90
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,880
multiplying it with the variance of the first factor

91
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,950
the loading on the second factor squared, multiplying

92
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,180
by the variance of the returns of the second factor, so 5%

93
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,110
squared.

94
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,570
Plus idiosyncratic variance, it's 10% squared.

95
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,570
Computing this gives us 0.052%.

96
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,708
So this is the variance of returns on stock B.

97
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,250
To find the standard deviation, we're

98
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,870
taking the square root of this, which gives us 22.8%.

99
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,430
So the volatility of the returns on stock B is 22.8%.

100
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,087
Now notice that the volatility of returns on the first stock

101
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,920
is higher than the volatility of the returns

102
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,520
on the second stock, even though stock B seems

103
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,130
to be risky because it has, or at least

104
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,520
in terms of systematic risk, it has much higher loadings

105
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,670
on systematic returns factors.

106
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,200
But, of course, what makes stock A overall riskier

107
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,380
than stock B is the fact that it has much higher idiosyncratic

108
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,180
volatility, 25% versus 10% for stock B.

109
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,050
So that directly feeds into overall higher risk for stock A

110
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,450
compared to the overall risk for stock B.
