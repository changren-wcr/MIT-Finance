1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,410
PROFESSOR: Now what I will do right now,

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,150
I will increase the number of stocks from 30 to 300.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,970
I will maintain the assumption that the loadings

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,760
on the first factor for each of these 300 stocks

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,440
right now is still one and I will maintain the same loading

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,480
structure on the second factor but I

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,210
will assume that for the first 100 stocks

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,590
the second beta, beta 2 is equal to 1.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,110
For the next 100 stocks, so from 101 to 200, the beta is 1.6,

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,872
and from 201 to 300, so for the last 100 stocks, beta 2 is 2.1.

11
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:42,330
Right now I want to understand what

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,070
happens to betas of the portfolio, the factor loadings,

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,190
of this equally weighted portfolio on factor 1

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,440
and factor 2.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,000
And so let's see, for the first factor

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,130
we get, it's exactly the same expression

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,620
because it's an equally weighted portfolio,

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,010
so all that changes is just n1.

19
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,262
So before it was 30, right now it's 300.

20
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:10,140
And you can see that this expression again

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,330
is going to be equal to 1 because we're

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,440
adding 1 over 300.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,190
So this is the weight that we put in each individual stock,

24
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,270
300 times.

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,220
Before we were doing it 30 times.

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,752
And so this sum is just equal to 1.

27
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:24,210
And again, this should be intuitive

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,070
that if each of the individual stocks have factor loading of 1

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,980
on the first factor, then again, if we combine them

30
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,620
into a portfolio, the portfolio loading on factor 1

31
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,788
is going to be just simply equal to 1 as well.

32
00:01:37,788 --> 00:01:39,330
For equal weighted portfolio but then

33
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,880
again for any other portfolio as well.

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
Now let's see what happens to the factor loading

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,500
on the second factor.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
So this is the same expression as we

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,950
had before again, n1 right now is 300, but all we're doing

38
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,830
is that we are adding the second beta for each

39
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,440
of the individual stocks and so here we're doing,

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,920
we're adding it 100 times for the first asset,

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,600
so it's 100 times 1, then 100 times 1.6

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,360
for the second class of stocks and then

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,280
another 100 multiplied by 2.1.

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,530
So this is for the last class of stocks with this beta.

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,140
And so then all we're doing is that we're adding this up

46
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,290
and we're dividing it by n1, which right now is 300.

47
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,350
And you can see that this is just,

48
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,400
it's a simple scaling compared to the case

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,040
that we had before when we had 30 stocks, so we

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,830
were multiplying by 10 and were dividing by 30, right now

51
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,930
we're multiplying it by 100 and dividing it by 300.

52
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,110
So this doesn't change the final answer

53
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,580
that the beta, second beta the loading

54
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,910
of this portfolio in the second factor is 1.57.

55
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,530
So this doesn't change.

56
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,780
So the result here is that as we increase

57
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,160
the number of stocks in this portfolio from 30 to 300 factor

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,120
loadings stay the same.
