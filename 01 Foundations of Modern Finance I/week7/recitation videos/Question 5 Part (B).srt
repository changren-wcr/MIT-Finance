1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,190
PROFESSOR: Let's use our estimated APT model

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,645
to forecast future expected returns.

3
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:08,520
Let's assume that the returns on those stocks

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,030
satisfy the exact two factor APT model

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,070
with the stock market and the gold ETF as the two factors.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,260
Let's also assume that the estimated factor loadings

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,240
are exact.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,040
Suppose that we are given a forecast

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,100
for the expected excess monthly returns going forward

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,260
for the market of 0.75% and for the gold 0.15%.

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,600
Let's use the average factor loadings we've computed

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,760
and compute the expected excess return

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,800
for the technology sector and for the gold mining sector.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,820
To compute the expected returns on both of these sectors,

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,610
we need to take the factor risk premia

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,310
and multiply them by the loadings

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,360
that these two sectors have on the corresponding risk factors.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,440
So let's start with the expected return on the technology

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,240
sector.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,550
It will be equal the expected excess return

21
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,600
on the market multiplied by the loadings

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,220
that technology sector has on the market,

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,910
which is 0.98, plus the expected excess return on gold,

24
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,710
which is 0.15%.

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,780
This is the number given to us.

26
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,130
Multiplied by the loadings that the technology sector

27
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,470
has on the gold risk factor, which is negative 0.17.

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,770
And this would be our expected return

29
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,660
on the technology sector.

30
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,240
Similarly, for the gold mining sector,

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,730
we have the expected excess return on the market multiplied

32
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:52,620
by the loadings that the mining sector has on the market,

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,930
which is 0.19, plus the expected excess return

34
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,230
on the gold multiplied by the loadings

35
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,080
that the gold sector has on the gold, which is 1.75.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,892
And the result would be 0.4%.

37
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,509


38
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:12,890
To summarize, given the forecast of the expected excess monthly

39
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,350
returns on the market and gold, 0.75% and 0.15%,

40
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,560
the expected return of the technology sector

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,810
monthly return would be 0.71 and the expected monthly return

42
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,040
in the gold mining sector would be 0.4%.

43
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,000
