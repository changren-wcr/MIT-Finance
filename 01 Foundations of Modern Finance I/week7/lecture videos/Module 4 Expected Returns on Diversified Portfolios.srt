1
00:00:00,783 --> 00:00:02,200
PROFESSOR: We now develop a result

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,900
that relates expected returns on well-diversified portfolios

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,750
to their systematic risk.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,950
Let's start with an example, and use an arbitrage argument

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,790
to establish this kind of relation.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,290
In our example, there are two portfolios, A and B.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,470
And there is a single common source of risk,

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,770
that is a single common factor.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,470
We assume that the expected excess return--

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,900
recall that excess returns are measured relative

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,350
to the risk-free rate.

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,880
The expected excess return on portfolio A is 5%.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,730
And for portfolio B it is 8%.

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,760
The loading on the common factor is 1 for portfolio A

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,410
and 2 for portfolio B.

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,200
We want to argue that with this set of assumptions,

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,840
the market contains arbitrage.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,810
Let's consider the following arbitrage strategy.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,310
We're going to borrow $1 at the risk-free rate.

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,860
We are going to short $1 of portfolio

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,450
B and invest $2 into portfolio A.

22
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,640
By construction, this strategy doesn't require any capital.

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,360
We borrow $1, raise another dollar by shorting,

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,510
and invest the $2 in portfolio A.

25
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,150
Let's consider the payoff of this strategy next period.

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,390
The payoff from borrowing $1 is going to be minus 1

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,910
plus the risk-free rate.

28
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,260
The payoff from shorting portfolio B is minus 1

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,370
plus the risk-free rate, plus the risk premium on portfolio

30
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,700
B, plus the factor loading, which

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,780
is 2, times the realization of the factor, F.

32
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,090
This is multiplied by the scale of our investment, which is $1.

33
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,180
The payoff from our investment in portfolio A

34
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,870
is going to be 1 plus RF plus the 5% risk premium,

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,420
plus the factor loading, which is 1,

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,410
times the realization of the factor, F, multiplied by $2.

37
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,960
When we sum up all of these payoffs across the three

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,650
legs of our position, we find that the effect of the factor

39
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,830
disappears, that exposure cancels out,

40
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,200
and we're left with $0.02.

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,170
In other words, we started with no capital

42
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,290
and we constructed a portfolio with three positions in it,

43
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,970
which pays $0.02 next period with no risk.

44
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,910
This is arbitrage or free lunch.

45
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,820
The reason why we were able to find arbitrage

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,690
is that expected excess returns on our portfolios

47
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,330
and their factor loadings were not consistent with each other.

48
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,190
We will now generalize this result

49
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,970
and establish a relation between factor loadings

50
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,250
and expected returns, which is needed

51
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,830
in order to avoid arbitrage.

52
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,420
In particular, we want to show that expected excess returns

53
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,740
and factor loadings have to be linearly related.

54
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,080
For a single-factor model, this means

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,910
that for any portfolio, p, the expected excess return

56
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,410
has to be equal to its factor loading,

57
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,180
b sub p, times a constant, lambda.

58
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,880
This constant has to be common to all portfolios.

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,680
To see why this needs to be the case,

60
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,290
we're going to repeat the arbitrage

61
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,710
argument similar to the one that we just discussed

62
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,030
for our particular example.

63
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,890
Suppose that for another portfolio, portfolio q,

64
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,550
the risk premium is equal to its factor loading,

65
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,300
b sub q, times a different constant, lambda prime.

66
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,190
Lambda prime and lambda are not the same.

67
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,550
Assume also that b sub q, the loading on the factor,

68
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,370
is non-zero.

69
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,660
Now, we create a three-legged arbitrage.

70
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,772
We'll short $1 of portfolio p.

71
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:05,094
We buy bp over bq dollars of portfolio q.

72
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:11,190
And we borrow, bp over bq minus 1.

73
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,730
As you can see, this portfolio, this entire trade,

74
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,920
does not require any capital.

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,290
It is self-financing.

76
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,480
As we look at its payoff, we observe

77
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,680
that the payoff from the first investment, $1 in portfolio p,

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,090
plus the second investment, the investment in portfolio q,

79
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,770
plus the risk-free component, when

80
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,160
we sum them up, have the property

81
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,150
that there is no exposure to the factor remaining,

82
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,790
and the payoff is in fact a constant.

83
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:49,500
It's equal to lambda prime minus lambda times b sub p.

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,190
To avoid arbitrage, this constant

85
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,120
has to be equal to zero.

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,210
A zero-investment portfolio without risk cannot produce

87
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,260
non-zero payoffs.

88
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,950
We conclude that lambda prime and lambda

89
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,350
have to be the same to avoid arbitrage.

90
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,230
We have established an important result. That

91
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,800
in a frictionless market with a single-factor structure

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,270
of returns, in order to avoid arbitrage risk premium on all

93
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,020
well-diversified portfolios have to be given

94
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,220
by a product of the factor loading of the portfolio

95
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,350
and a common constant, lambda.

96
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,900
The factor loading represents the quantity

97
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,150
of risk in each portfolio.

98
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,750
It's a measure of systematic risk.

99
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,270
Lambda tells us how much compensation a portfolio

100
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,540
is going to earn per unit of systematic risk.

101
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,250
We call lambda the price of risk or the market price of risk

102
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,860
or the factor risk premium.

103
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,900
Our pricing result can be extended

104
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,910
to multi-factor models.

105
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,890
The result is very similar.

106
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,340
The risk premium on any well-diversified portfolio

107
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,490
is based on its factor exposures.

108
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,920
In particular, it is a sum across all

109
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,100
of the common factors, or the factor loading

110
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,640
times the corresponding factor premium or price of risk.

111
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,850
These factor exposures describe systematic risk

112
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,020
of the portfolio.

113
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,030
Now, in contrast to the single-factor case,

114
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,860
this is a vector.

115
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,480
A portfolio is characterized by a vector of its risk exposures.

116
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,740
We need to know how a portfolio loads on each of the factors

117
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,170
to fully describe its risk.

118
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,860
And each of these risk exposures carries its own risk premium.

119
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,340
Different factors don't earn the same compensation

120
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,560
for their risk exposures.

121
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,320
The intuition of this result is that we

122
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,920
could construct multiple portfolios with identical risk

123
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,120
exposures.

124
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,480
To avoid arbitrage, the expected returns have to be the same.

125
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,460
This means that expected return or the risk premium

126
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,890
on any diversified portfolio must

127
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:06,080
be determined by its exposure to the common factors.
