1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,050
PROFESSOR: We now extend the APT result to individual assets.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,530
Let's recap.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,950
So far, we established that absence

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,250
of arbitrage out of the assumption of factor models

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,260
implies that the risk premium on all well diversified

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,460
portfolios, have to be determined by their factor

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,800
loadings and the risk premium on individual factors.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,810
What economists say about risk premium

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,180
on individual securities?

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,460
It turns out that the same relation

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,600
has to apply to almost all individual securities.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,090
This result is what is called the arbitrage price and theory.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,040
And it was developed by Stephen Ross in 1976.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,400
To see the intuition for why APT relation must

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,160
hold for individual assets, at least

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,830
for most individual assets, suppose

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,850
that this relation is violated.

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,960
If APT relation is violated for many individual assets,

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,010
we should be able to find many securities for which expected

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,630
asset return is not equal to the sum of factor loadings

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,610
and factor risk premium.

22
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,090
There is going to be an extra term, which we call an alpha.

23
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,520
Alpha captures the degree of violation of the APT pricing

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,970
relation.

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,040
We also think of alpha as a measure of mispricing,

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,620
relative to the APT pricing formula.

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,670
Suppose that many assets have a non-zero alpha.

28
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,130
To be specific, let's say that many assets

29
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,610
have a positive alpha.

30
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,880
Our argument is going to be exactly analogous

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,870
if these alphas are negative.

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,880
Let's collect all of these securities

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,600
with positive alphas, and combine them into an equally

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,860
weighted portfolio.

35
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,500
Call this portfolio, p star.

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,880
The risk premium on this portfolio

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,340
is a weighted average of the risk

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,770
premium of individual assets.

39
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,400
As it is out, we see that the risk premium on this portfolio

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,110
is given by the average alpha across the securities,

41
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,250
plus the term that reflects the factor exposures,

42
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,720
or the portfolio P star.

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,440
In other words, we were able to construct a portfolio p

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,280
star for which the APT relation is violated.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,440
The risk premium on this portfolio

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,400
is not equal to the sum across the factors of the factor

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,640
loading times the risk premium.

48
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,790
There is an extra term, the non-zero alpha.

49
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,630
What this means is that if the APT relation is violated

50
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,450
for a large number of individual assets,

51
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,665
it is going to be violated for some

52
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:41,940
of all diversified portfolios and that

53
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,970
as we concluded before would lead to arbitrage.

54
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,430
We therefore conclude that the APT formula, the relation

55
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,090
between expected returns and factor loadings,

56
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,500
must hold for almost all individual assets.

57
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,000
