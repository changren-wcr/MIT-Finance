1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,300
PROFESSOR: We next introduce an important concept,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,780
a factor-mimicking portfolio.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,880
So far, our common factors didn't

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,820
need to be traded assets.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,550
They could be macroeconomic shocks.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,120
They could also be returns on financial assets.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,320
It turns out that we can replace any common shock

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,830
with a corresponding return on the financial portfolio.

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,400
This portfolio is called the factor-mimicking portfolio.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,020
Let's see how it can be done.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,050
Consider a case of a single-factor model.

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,230
We can visualize the APT relation graphically.

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,960
On the graph, on the horizontal axis,

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,160
we plot the factor exposure, b sub p.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,790
On the vertical axis, we plot the expected returns

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,350
on the portfolios, r bar p.

17
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,320
The relation between expected portfolio returns

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,730
and the factor loading is linear.

19
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,280
For the portfolio with zero-factor loading,

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,900
the return is equal to the risk-free rate.

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,590
This is the point on the vertical axis.

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,800
And for the portfolios with positive factor loadings,

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,360
average returns are positive and increasing with the magnitude

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,720
of the factor risk exposure.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,570
Consider one of these portfolios with a factor

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,850
loading equal to one.

27
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,990
Under the APT relation, the risk premium on this portfolio

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,100
has to be equal to the risk premium of the factor,

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,410
or lambda.

30
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,080
We can therefore see that the portfolio

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,130
with the factor loading equal to one or with the unit factor

32
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,520
beta can be used as a factor-mimicking portfolio.

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,430
The risk premium on this portfolio

34
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,260
is equal to the price of risk of the factor.

35
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,990
Moreover, because this portfolio is perfectly

36
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,990
correlated with the factor, we can use it

37
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,500
instead of the factor in the APT relation itself.

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,340
In other words, we can replace the factor

39
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,740
by its mimicking portfolio in our factor model.

40
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,110
Next, we generalize the argument of the case

41
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,090
of a multi-factor model.

42
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,750
We start with the model with the K factors.

43
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,540
And we consider K portfolios--

44
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,700
P1, P2, and so forth--

45
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,490
which are linearly independent.

46
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,700
Our objective is to construct mimicking portfolios

47
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,310
for each of the common factors.

48
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,370
Once we do that, the expected excess returns

49
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,540
on these portfolios are going to tell us the risk premia

50
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,760
for the associated factors.

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,420
To construct a mimicking portfolio for factor j,

52
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,420
we need to build a portfolio with the property

53
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,680
that its loading on factor j is equal to one.

54
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,460
And its loadings on all the other factors

55
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,100
are equal to zero.

56
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,930
This can be expressed algebraically

57
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,580
as a system of equations.

58
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,890
The factor loading of the portfolio

59
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,920
is equal to the weighted average of the factor

60
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,610
loadings of the individual assets or the portfolio

61
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,600
components.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:21,110
In our case, these assets are portfolios P1, P2, through PK.

63
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,820
So consider the exposure to factor one.

64
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,410
We have the weight of the first portfolio multiplied

65
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,330
by its loading on the first factor,

66
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,650
plus the weight of the second portfolio multiplied

67
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,990
by its loading on the first factor, and so forth.

68
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,530
The equation tells us that the loading

69
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,170
of the portfolio on the first factor is equal to zero.

70
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,110
We do the same for each of the factors.

71
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,080
Factor j is special.

72
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,560
The loading on that factor is equal to one.

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,070
The loadings on all the other factors are zero.

74
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,330
We have a system of equations with K unknowns and K

75
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,830
equations.

76
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,240
We can find a unique solution.

77
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,430
This allows us to construct factor-mimicking portfolios.

78
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,470
To see how a procedure would work,

79
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,089
let's apply it to our previous example.

80
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,140
We have two portfolios, A and B. And two common factors,

81
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,890
a growth shock and an energy shock.

82
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,990
Portfolio A has a loading of 1 and 1.25

83
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,220
are the two factors, respectively.

84
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,982
Portfolio B has the loadings of 2 and minus 0.5.

85
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:38,410
We want to build a factor-mimicking portfolio

86
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,570
for the energy shock.

87
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,910
This portfolio has a weight of wA on portfolio A and wB

88
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,550
on portfolio B.

89
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,790
It must have zero exposure to the growth shock,

90
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,490
and the unit exposure to the energy shock.

91
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,810
These two conditions can be expressed as two equations.

92
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,130
For the growth shock we have the weight

93
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,320
on portfolio A multiplied by the beta of that portfolio, which

94
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,500
is one, plus the weight on portfolio B,

95
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,860
multiplied by the beta of that portfolio, which is two.

96
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,240
And the sum of these exposures has to be equal to zero.

97
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,880
For the energy shock, we have similar logic.

98
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,560
1.25, which is the loading of portfolio A multiplied

99
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,320
by the weight of A in the portfolio minus 0.5

100
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,000
times the weight of B is equal to one.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,720
We solve the system equations to find

102
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,580
that the weight on portfolio A is 2/3, 0.67.

103
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,040
And the weight of portfolio B is minus 0.33.

104
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,190
Notice that these weights do not sum up to one,

105
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,440
and that is because in our construction

106
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,370
we are implicitly using a risk-free asset.

107
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,870
So as we add up the weights, the residual,

108
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,930
the difference between one and the sum of these weights

109
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,930
has to be invested in the risk-free asset.

110
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,340
In this particular example, we find a mimicking portfolio

111
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,545
for the energy factor which has weights of 2/3 on portfolio A

112
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:17,500
and minus 1/3 on portfolio B. And that

113
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,190
implies that the risk premium on the energy factor

114
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,870
is equal to 4%, which is exactly the same result that we

115
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,250
followed previously by computing the risk premia implied

116
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,590
by the expected returns on portfolios A and B.
