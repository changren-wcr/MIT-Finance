1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,520
PROFESSOR: We will now discuss the empirical implementation

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,250
of APT and consider a couple of important examples.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,330
As we implement APT empirically, we need to take three steps.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,240
First, we need to choose or identify the common factors.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,900
Common factors are the economic variables, or the mimicking

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,960
portfolios that we think affect a broad cross-section of asset

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,790
returns.

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,020
At that point, we need to make a choice.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,630
How many factors to use and which factors are important.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,330
There is no clear recipe for this choice.

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,720
There are several techniques that could be used.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,410
You could use prior information about common economic shocks,

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,660
macro-factors that may be relevant.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,280
You could use statistical techniques

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,310
to help us choose which common factors are

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,220
important for describing the cross-section of returns

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,300
and how many of them to use.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,270
The choice of the number and the nature of factors

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,640
is outside of the APT framework itself.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,850
So we need to use other considerations

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,840
to choose the factors.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,970
The second step is estimation of factor loadings.

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,430
We need to use statistical techniques

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,050
to figure out how various assets load on the common factors.

25
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,610
Typically, this is done by running

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,080
a time-series regression of portfolio returns

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,360
on the factors.

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,130
The third step is to estimate risk premia.

29
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,300
We do this usually by regressing returns

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,750
on various assets on the factor loadings.

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,880
This kind of cross-sectional regression

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,940
reveals the compensation for exposure

33
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,360
to each individual factor.

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,420
At the end, we end up with an assessment of which factors

35
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,230
are important for describing the cross-section of returns

36
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:59,270
and how much compensation is earned by various risk factors.

37
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,720
As the first example of the implementation of APT,

38
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,660
consider a macro-factor model.

39
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,750
This was the model developed by Chen, Roll, and Ross

40
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,270
in the 1986 article.

41
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,990
In this model, they have several common factors.

42
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,850
In addition to the market factor,

43
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,180
they consider a number of macroeconomic factors

44
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,600
such as shocks in industrial production,

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,680
changes in expected and unexpected inflation,

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,860
as well as changes in the risk premium, which they

47
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,150
proxy by the difference in returns between bonds rated

48
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,820
Baa and lower and long-term government

49
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,880
bonds and unexpected changes in the term premium which

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,120
are the differences in returns between long-term government

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,670
bonds and T-bills.

52
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:55,740
The data sample covers the period from 1953 to 1984.

53
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,820
The next step in the analysis is to estimate betas

54
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,000
on the asset of diversifiable portfolios.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,840
The portfolios they choose are equity portfolios

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,950
sorted on the market capitalization of the stocks.

57
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,590
They construct 20 portfolios, starting

58
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,130
from the 5% of the smallest firms

59
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,930
and going all the way up to the 5% of the largest firms.

60
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,530
They run a time series regression

61
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,860
of returns on each of these portfolios

62
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,720
on the corresponding factors.

63
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,410
In this regression, they use five years of monthly data

64
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,640
to estimate the current value of de facto loadings for each

65
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,970
of these portfolios.

66
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,250
As a result of this analysis, they

67
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,500
obtain estimates of factor betas for each of the factors,

68
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,440
for each of the portfolios in the data set each month.

69
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,460
Next, the paper estimates factor risk premia.

70
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,410
We have 20 diversified portfolios based

71
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,470
on the market cap of the firms.

72
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,030
For each of these portfolios we have

73
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,540
estimates of the factor loadings for each of the factors.

74
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,190
So each month we run the cross-sectional regression

75
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,880
of portfolio returns on the corresponding factor loadings.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,399


77
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,810
The slope, coefficients in this regression, the lambdas

78
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,080
estimate the factor risk premia.

79
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,690
After running this regression each month,

80
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,180
we average the results across time

81
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,870
to find an estimate of the average risk premium associated

82
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,450
with each of the factors.

83
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,420
The result of this analysis is that all

84
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,740
of the economic factors used in the model appear to be priced.

85
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,470
There is a compensation attached to exposures

86
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,780
to all of these factors.

87
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,550
We also see that various factors have different prices of risk.

88
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,340
And in fact, they are different inside.

89
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,870
Some of them are positive.

90
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,150
Others are negative.

91
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,380
The APT model itself does not tell us how and why these risk

92
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,120
premia are determined.

93
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,920
Why is it that one of the factors

94
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,110
has a large positive risk premium?

95
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,680
And the other has a negative risk premium?

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,540
To understand where these risk premia are coming from,

97
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,990
we need to think about the economics of risk exposures

98
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,630
and how they're compensated in the market.

99
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,690
Again, the APT as a pricing model

100
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,690
is not concerned with the sources of risk premia.

101
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,470
It simply tells us that expected excess returns

102
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,230
on various portfolios of various assets

103
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,430
have to be consistent with each other.

104
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,420
They have to be consistent with the factor risk premia.

105
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,410
Where these premia are coming from is outside of the model.

106
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,250
Having said that, we can make some sense of the magnitude,

107
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,160
and in particular the sign of the risk premia

108
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,930
associated with different factors.

109
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,310
For example, if we look at the Industrial production, that's

110
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,680
the MP factor in the model, we see

111
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,400
that the risk premium for this factor is positive.

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,460
What this means is that the securities that

113
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,400
tend to fall in value at a time when there

114
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,980
is a negative shock to industrial production

115
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,080
tend to earn relatively higher returns.

116
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,030
This is fairly intuitive.

117
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,940
The times when industrial production declines

118
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,390
are usually the times of economic downturns.

119
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,700
And assets that lose value precisely

120
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,290
at the same time when the entire economy is not doing well

121
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,980
are less desirable.

122
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,700
They have to earn a relatively high average rate of return

123
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,520
to compensate their investors for holding that kind of risk.

124
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,910
We can think in a similar way about exposures

125
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,460
to other kinds of risk factors and why

126
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,820
they're compensated positively or negatively with their risk

127
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,570
premia.

128
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,820
We observe another important result here

129
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,490
that the market factor, the first factor

130
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,300
in the table, that's the value weighted portfolio of stocks,

131
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,120
doesn't seem to be priced after we control

132
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,680
for the other economic factors.

133
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,060
What this means is that whatever economic shocks are driving

134
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,040
the market portfolio, it seems to be

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,500
captured by the other factors in the model.

136
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,760
And after controlling for the exposure to the other factors,

137
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,190
exposure to the market is not compensated

138
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,760
with an additional risk premium.
