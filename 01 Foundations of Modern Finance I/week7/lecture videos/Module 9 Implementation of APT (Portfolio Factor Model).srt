1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,750
PROFESSOR: Our second example is a famous model

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,180
developed by Fama and French.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,380
We're going to use a couple of papers from 1993 and '96

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,350
to describe their construction.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,440
In, this model, factors are not driven

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,450
by macroeconomic variables.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,520
Or rather, they're not explicitly defined

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,710
in terms of macroeconomic variables.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,440
But instead, factors are constructed

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,870
as portfolios of stocks.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,430
In other words, in this analysis,

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,420
we directly build factor-mimicking portfolios

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,735
rather than starting with the economically motivated factors.

14
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:40,390


15
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,540
Fama and French design their factor-mimicking portfolios

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,630
by sorting firms on two characteristics--

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,620
size and the book-to-market ratio.

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,750
Size in this case corresponds to the market capitalization

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,890
of the stock.

20
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,810
And the book-to-market ratio is the ratio of the book value

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,450
of equity to its market value.

22
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,900
The idea, the premise behind this construction,

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,290
is that firms with different characteristics-- small firms

24
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,230
versus large firms, high book-to-market firms

25
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,800
versus low book-to-market firms have different exposures

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,540
to important macroeconomic factors.

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,350
And therefore, by sorting these characteristics

28
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,630
and by building portfolios, we can

29
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,990
construct mimicking portfolios for the underlying macro

30
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,190
factors.

31
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,980
Of course, we don't quite know what these factors are,

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,280
but we can nonetheless use the mimicking portfolios

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,120
in a statistical manner to build factor models.

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,730
We end up with a three-factor model.

35
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,020
The first factor is the value-weighted market return

36
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,370
minus the return on the T-Bill.

37
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,360
We call it RM minus Rf.

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,650
The second factor, which is called SMB, small minus big,

39
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,600
is a long-short portfolio, which has long small-cap stocks

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,940
and short large-cap stocks.

41
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,280
The third portfolio, HML, or high minus low,

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,600
is a portfolio which has long high book-to-market firms

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,150
and short low book-to-market firms.

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,080
High book-to-market firms are what is called value firms.

45
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,660
And the low book-to-market firms are called growth firms.

46
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,400
So this is a value minus growth portfolio.

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,450
These portfolios-- the market minus the risk-free rate,

48
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,230
small minus big, and high minus low--

49
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,640
seem to earn significant risk premia.

50
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,130
Over the sample period considered in the paper,

51
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,000
the risk premium on the market is 0.43%,

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,180
the premium on the SMB portfolio is 0.27%,

53
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,610
and the premium on HML, the value factor is 0.4%.

54
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,220
All of these monthly numbers.

55
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,130
We can see that these premia are economically large

56
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,380
and they are also statistically significant.

57
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,300
We now consider an application of the three-factor Fama-French

58
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,290
model.

59
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,300
In their construction, they use stocks

60
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,760
from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ from a period from 1963 to '91.

61
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,820
And they built 25 portfolios.

62
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,455
These portfolios are sorted on size and book-to-market ratios.

63
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,980


64
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,980
For each of these 25 portfolios, they're

65
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,090
on the regression of the excess portfolio return, that's

66
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,970
the portfolio return minus the risk-free rate,

67
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,740
on the three common factors, the market factor, the SMB,

68
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,260
small minus big portfolio factor,

69
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,920
and HML, the value factor.

70
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,880
After earning these regressions, we

71
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,650
can evaluate the loadings on the factors to see to what extent

72
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,260
various portfolios have different loadings

73
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,970
on the common factors, and the intercepts or the alphas.

74
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,890
If the APT model describes risk premia on these 25 portfolios

75
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,560
accurately, these alphas should be close to zero.

76
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,690
In the first table which would take

77
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,899
from the Fama-French paper, we see the distribution

78
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,800
of average returns across the 25 portfolios sorted

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,380
on size and book-to-market.

80
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,210
What we see is that as we go from low to high values

81
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,520
of the market cap, portfolio returns decline.

82
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,800
In other words, small stocks tend

83
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,260
to earn relatively higher returns

84
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,780
compared to the large stocks.

85
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,760
Value stocks, which are the companies

86
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,790
with the high book-to-market ratio,

87
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,890
tend to earn relatively high returns

88
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,990
compared to the growth stocks.

89
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,180
In other words, there is a significant degree

90
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,080
of heterogeneity in average returns across these 25

91
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,890
portfolios.

92
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,000
This is what the APT model, the three-factor model,

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,690
is going to try to explain.

94
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,910
We observed that there is a significant amount

95
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,640
of heterogeneity in the factor loadings across the 25

96
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,450
portfolios.

97
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,330
While the loadings on the market appear

98
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,000
to be relatively similar, the loadings

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,840
on the SMB and the HML factor are quite different.

100
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,690
This is not surprising.

101
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,750
The SMB factor is a long-short portfolio

102
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,810
of small versus large firms.

103
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,320
Small stocks tend to have a positive exposure

104
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,050
to this portfolio return, and large stocks

105
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,570
tend to have a negative exposure.

106
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:45,110
Similar logic applies to the HML portfolio and their exposures

107
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,730
along the dimensions of high versus

108
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,010
low market-to-book ratios.

109
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,180


110
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,040
The important numbers for us here

111
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,040
are the R-squared in the regression of portfolio

112
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,180
returns for these 25 size and book-to-market portfolios

113
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,140
on the common factors.

114
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,070
These R-squared numbers are quite high.

115
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,460
They are often in excess of 90%.

116
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,730
What this is telling us is that the three factors--

117
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,790
the market, SMB, and HML--

118
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,880
are doing a very good job at capturing return

119
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,690
variation of these 25 portfolios, which is something

120
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,810
we would expect in a three-factor APT world

121
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,650
because each of these 25 portfolios is well-diversified.

122
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,140
And therefore, their returns should be well explained

123
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,020
by the common factors.

124
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,710
In this final table, we'll look at the intercepts in the time

125
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,990
series regression of the returns on each of these 25 portfolios

126
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,790
on the three common factors--

127
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,490
the market, SMB and HML.

128
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,554
If you compare this to the analysis of the Chen, Roll,

129
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:56,030
and Ross model, this is a different technique.

130
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,440
Instead of regressing asset returns cross-sectionally

131
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
on the factor loadings, we are running a time series

132
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,530
regression where we're regressing each portfolio

133
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,630
return on the common factors.

134
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,270
Under the APT model, the intercept

135
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,680
of this regression or the alpha should be equal to zero.

136
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,230
Of course, in any statistical exercise,

137
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,120
we have estimation errors.

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,220
And so the intercept in this regression

139
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,920
is not going to be literally equal to zero.

140
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,090
But we can think about statistical tests of how

141
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,160
different these are from zero.

142
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,500
We can also think economically how

143
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,470
significant these deviations from zero may be.

144
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,220
What we find is that for most of the 25 portfolios,

145
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,330
the intercept, the alpha, is in fact quite close to zero.

146
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,860
Economically and statistically indistinguishable from zero.

147
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,860
There are a couple of exceptions that we observe, particularly

148
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,710
for small stock portfolios.

149
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,100
So what this is telling us is that by and large,

150
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,600
the cross-sectional differences in returns on the 25 portfolios

151
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,960
can be well described by a three-factor model.

152
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,460
There are some violations that we're

153
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,230
observing for small stocks.

154
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,130
So perhaps, a three-factor model is not a perfect description

155
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,020
of expected returns here.

156
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,470
Nonetheless, it does capture to a significant degree

157
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,350
the amount of cross-sectional variation in the returns

158
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,710
across these portfolios.

159
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,510
We have looked at a couple of examples

160
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,090
of how the APT framework can be applied

161
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:35,110
to determine expected excess returns on various assets.

162
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,559
We didn't go into the technical details of how exactly

163
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,440
regressions are set up an estimated.

164
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,830
What we wanted to illustrate is the concept.

165
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,620
That risk premier of various common factors

166
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,390
can be inferred from the history of returns on financial assets.

167
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,030
There are multiple techniques that could be used for that--

168
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,090
cross-sectional regressions, time series regressions.

169
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,370
One of the bottlenecks of the APT

170
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,110
is that the theory doesn't tell us

171
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,090
where the factors are coming from

172
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,560
or how many factors we need.

173
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,820
Making those choices requires some understanding

174
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,190
of the economics of the problem and

175
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,800
further statistical analysis.

176
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,610
At the end of the day, APT is a framework

177
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,010
which is rather flexible and can be used

178
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,500
in a variety of circumstances.

179
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,150
It enforces the notion that absence of arbitrage

180
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,500
imposes a strong restriction of how expected excess returns are

181
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,120
related to risk exposures.

182
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,050
This logic is quite robust, and it shows up

183
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,510
across a variety of asset pricing models.

184
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,710
In this way, the APT framework provides a general template

185
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,400
of how risk premia or expected returns can

186
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,210
be related to measures of risk.
