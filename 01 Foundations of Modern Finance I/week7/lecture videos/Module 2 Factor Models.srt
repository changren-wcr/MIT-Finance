00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,470
PROFESSOR: We now take a closer look

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,490
at the technical details of factor models.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,420
Let's start with the single-factor model.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,020
We have a large number of individual assets indexed by i.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,240
One, two, three, and so forth.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,780
Returns on these assets are denoted by ri tilde

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,780
to remind us that these are random.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,330
And the expect returns are denoted by ri bar.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,910
These returns are driven by a set

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,170
of common or systematic factors and by idiosyncratic shocks.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,630
We denote systematic factors by capital F.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,930
These are, for example, shocks to economic growth or shocks

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,430
to the value of the market portfolio and so forth.

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,560
Little f represents the news component of the common factor.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,810
By definition, little f is equal to the factor value, F,

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,630
minus its expected value, F bar.

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:06,540
In other words, little f is the demeaned value of the factor.

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,860
Idiosyncratic shock of each asset, epsilon i, by definition

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,170
has zero mean.

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,320
The key assumption that we make for the factor model

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,260
is that idiosyncratic shocks are truly asset-specific,

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,430
which means that they are pairwise uncorrelated

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,290
across all the assets.

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,970
In other words, the covariance of epsilon i

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,410
and epsilon j for two different assets i and j

26
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,780
has to be equal to zero.

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,570
We now describe a return on any asset

28
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,290
as a sum of its expected value, ri bar,

29
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,580
plus the factor, F, times the loading on this factor,

30
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,480
which is asset-specific, that's b sub i, plus the idiosyncratic

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,070
shock, epsilon i.

32
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,020
Under this model, the variance of returns on assets i

33
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,740
consists of two terms.

34
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,850
The first term reflects the amount of systematic risk

35
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,440
to which this asset is exposed.

36
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,960
This component of the variance is

37
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,670
equal to the square of the factor

38
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,889
loading times the variance of the factor.

39
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,440
That's bi squared times sigma F squared.

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,230
The second term in the variance of the asset

41
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,150
is the idiosyncratic piece.

42
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,820
This reflects the variance of firm-specific shocks.

43
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,330
The covariance of returns between two assets, i and j,

44
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,920
is captured fully by their loadings on the common factor.

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,810
And this is because covariance of idiosyncratic components

46
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,090
of returns is zero.

47
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,600
So what we find is that the covariance of returns in assets

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,140
i and j is given by the variance of the factor,

49
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,800
sigma F squared, times the product of the two factor

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,850
loadings, b sub i and b sub j.

51
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,150
What we see is that under the factor structure,

52
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,610
factor exposures determine how much asset returns can

53
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,160
move with each other.

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,310
And that is because factors describe

55
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,540
fully the common sources of variation across the assets.

56
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,290
On top of that, idiosyncratic risk of each asset

57
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,050
contributes to its own return variance.

58
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,260
Now, we can generalize our construction

59
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,990
to the case of multiple factors.

60
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,500
This is indirect analogy to the single-factor case.

61
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,700
Again, each asset return is given by its expected value

62
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,640
plus the systematic component, which is now

63
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,970
a sum of contributions across multiple common factors

64
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,160
from one to k, and the idiosyncratic component,

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,880
epsilon i.

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,690
These common factors are going to affect multiple assets.

67
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,290
Each asset has its own loadings on all of these factors, which

68
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,790
we call factor betas or factor sensitivities or factor

69
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,730
loadings.

70
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,010
And we allow factors to be correlated with each other,

71
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,750
so we don't make any assumptions about their joint distribution.

72
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,210
As in the case of a single-factor model,

73
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,110
we maintain the assumption that idiosyncratic shocks are truly

74
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,380
asset-specific and their pairwise covariance

75
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,330
across the assets is zero.

76
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,910
On top of that, we maintain the assumption

77
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,690
that our factors are demeaned, so that the expected value

78
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,240
of each of these factors is zero.
