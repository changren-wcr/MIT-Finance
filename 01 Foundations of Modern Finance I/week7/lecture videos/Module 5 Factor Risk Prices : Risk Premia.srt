00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,120
PROFESSOR: Next, we discuss estimation

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,370
of factor risk premia.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,160
How can we learn about prices of risk

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,850
associated with the various systematic factors.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,550
APT relation tells us that the risk premia

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,980
on various diversified portfolios

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,970
are based on their effect to exposures and their associated

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,250
prices of risk.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,160
We can therefore use market returns,

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,520
market prices to recover the implied risk

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,500
premia which are attached to all of these systematic factors.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,370
To see how this can be done, consider the following example.

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,250
Suppose we have two common factors.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,770
As before, it's a shock to economic growth

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,870
and a shock to energy prices.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,260
We start with the APT relation, that the risk premium

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,740
is a linear combination of factor loadings weighted

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,590
by prices of risk.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,730
Now, suppose we observe two well-diversified portfolios,

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,550
A and B. The expected returns on these portfolios

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,940
are 12% and 10%, respectively.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,850
And the risk-free interest rate is 2%.

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,260
The factor loadings for portfolio A

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,650
are 1 on the growth shock and 1.25 on the energy shock.

25
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,350
And for portfolio B, it's 2 on the growth shock and minus 0.5

26
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,680
the energy shock.

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,150
We want to use this data to recover

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,830
factor risk premia for the growth shock and the energy

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,730
shock.

30
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,500
The APT relation tells us that the expected excess return

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,250
on asset A, which is 12% minus 2%

32
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,940
is equal to its loading on the growth shock, which

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,500
is 1, times the price of risk of the shock, which is unknown,

34
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,200
that's lambda of the growth shock,

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,610
plus 1.25, which is the loading on the energy shock,

36
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,420
times the price of risk of that shock.

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,820
That gives us one equation that relates risk premia on the two

38
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,450
factors to the expected excess return of portfolio A.

39
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,620
We do the same for portfolio B and obtain a second relation.

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,780
We have a system of two equations

41
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,680
on the two unknown prices of risk that you can solve.

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,780
And we find the unique solution.

43
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,370
The risk premium associated with the energy shock is 4%.

44
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,890
And the risk premium on the growth shock is 5%.

45
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,130
To avoid arbitrage, all other portfolios

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,010
must have expected returns consistent with these factor

47
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,510
risk premia.

48
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,730
For example, if we have a third portfolio, portfolio C,

49
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,040
with a growth loading of one and the energy shock

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,940
loading of 0.5, then the risk premium on this portfolio

51
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,950
has to be equal to 1 times the premium on the growth shock,

52
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:08,220
plus 0.5 times the premium on the energy shock, or 7%.

53
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,310
What we see is that the risk premia associated

54
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,470
with the various risk factors can

55
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,160
be recovered from risk premia on well-diversified portfolios.
