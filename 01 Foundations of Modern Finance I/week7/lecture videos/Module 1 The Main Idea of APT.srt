00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,590
PROFESSOR: In this lecture, we develop the arbitrage pricing

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,750
theory, or APT.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,130
APT is an important theoretical model,

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,170
which relates expected returns on various risky assets

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,840
to their systematic risk.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,300
In particular, APT tells us how exactly

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,580
to quantify or measure systematic risk

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,950
of various assets.

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,070
The main idea of the APT is to start with the factor

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,290
model of returns.

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,090
Stock returns have common factors, or systematic factors

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,490
that affect the variety of assets,

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,700
and the non-systematic or firm-specific idiosyncratic

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,680
factors that affect individual assets or individual stocks.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,520
Diversification can be used to eliminate non-systematic risk,

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,940
which means that diversified portfolios are only

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,170
exposed to the common sources of risk, or factor risk.

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,240
This implies that risk premia or expected excess returns

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,080
on diversified portfolios depend on their exposure

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,120
to systematic risk factors.

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,370
This is the main result we are going to establish.

22
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,950


23
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,670
Because portfolios consist of individual assets performing

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,630
a variety of diversified portfolios,

25
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,680
we can show that for almost all risky assets,

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,530
expected returns also depend on their exposure

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,740
to systematic factors.

28
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,150
And that is the main result of APT,

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,620
that expected excess returns or risk premia on various assets

30
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,780
are determined by their exposures

31
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,860
to systematic sources of risk, or the common return factors.

32
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,400
Let's start by developing a factor model.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,780
Under the factor model, stock returns

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,870
are exposed to two kinds of shocks, two kinds of risk--

35
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,030
common shocks or common factors, and

36
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,840
asset-specific or firm-specific shocks.

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,110
Let's think about common factors.

38
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,340
These factors proxy for shocks to economic conditions

39
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,530
which affect the variety of firms

40
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,260
and which are important to investors.

41
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,380
Such shock could include shocks to economic growth,

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,320
shocks to monetary policy or interest rates,

43
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,560
shocks to oil price, government policy shocks, and so forth.

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,590
These are common macroeconomic shocks

45
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,270
that affect various firms.

46
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,240
Not necessarily in the same way, but they

47
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,040
are broadly important in the economy.

48
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,520
As an example, consider an asset the price of which

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,110
rises when inflation unexpectedly accelerates.

50
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,130
This kind of asset can be used to hedge inflation risk.

51
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,470
An investor who buys this asset is

52
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,710
going to gain some protection against inflation.

53
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,950
As a result, we would expect that assets like these

54
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,400
are going to earn relatively low-risk premia because they're

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,180
going to be in high demand by investors.

56
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,920
The bottom line is that factors represent systematic or common

57
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,400
sources of risk which cannot be diversified away by forming

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,670
portfolios.

59
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,430
Firm-specific events give rise to

60
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,400
idiosyncratic or firm-specific risks.

61
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,030
These include events like new product innovations,

62
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,230
lawsuits, changes in management, labor strikes, and so forth.

63
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,630
As an example, consider a two-factor model.

64
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,720
In this model, the two factors are

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,990
represented by shocks to economic growth

66
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,300
and to energy prices.

67
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,580
In particular, the shock to growth

68
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,590
is the unanticipated change in economic growth.

69
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,830
So it's expected value is zero.

70
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,630
And the same is true of the shock to energy prices.

71
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,540
Under this model, the return on any asset

72
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,680
is represented by its average value, Ri bar,

73
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,520
plus the sum of two systematic terms, which

74
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,390
are the shock to the economic growth times the loading

75
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,800
on that shock, b, plus the shock to energy prices,

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,770
times the loading on that shock, plus the idiosyncratic piece,

77
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,960
of epsilon i, which represents firm-specific idiosyncratic

78
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,030
shocks.

79
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,390
Consider further two hypothetical firms.

80
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,690
The first of these is the solar panel installer.

81
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,090
This company has moderate exposure

82
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,390
to the overall economic growth, so its loading

83
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,590
on the growth shock is going to be positive but perhaps

84
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,060
not very large.

85
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,860
This company also benefits from an increase in energy costs.

86
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,320
So its loading on energy prices is

87
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,080
likely to be positive and perhaps large.

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,760
The second company is a long-distance trucking firm.

89
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,770
This company is very cyclical.

90
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,380
Its cash flows are highly sensitive to economic activity.

91
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,730
And as a result, its loading on the economic growth shocks

92
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,380
is positive and large.

93
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,270
This company is also negatively exposed to energy costs.

94
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,230
Rising energy costs imply higher operational costs

95
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,340
for this firm.

96
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,920
And so its loading on the energy shock

97
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,840
is negative and large in absolute value.
