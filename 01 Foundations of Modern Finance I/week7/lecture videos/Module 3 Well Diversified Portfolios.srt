1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,980
PROFESSOR: We now consider the key step

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,260
in the derivation of the APT--

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,080
diversification.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,080
Consider a portfolio that includes multiple risk

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,920
assets, portfolio p.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,530
This portfolio is described by its weights,

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,450
which we denote by w.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,940
The return of the portfolio is a weighted average

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,820
of the returns on the individual assets.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,780
Therefore, we can derive the moments of portfolio returns

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,090
from portfolio weights and the properties

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,640
of the individual assets returns.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,290
In particular, the portfolio mean

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,410
is a weighted average of the average returns

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,230
across the assets in the portfolio.

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,480
The factor loadings of the portfolio

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,700
for each of the factors are also weighted

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,240
average of the individual factor loadings of the securities

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,040
in the portfolio.

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,180
And the idiosyncratic component of returns, epsilon p,

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,660
is a weighted average of individual epsilons.

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,040
It is this idiosyncratic piece that we

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,280
are interested in right now.

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,410
The variance of the idiosyncratic component

25
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,100
of portfolio return is the variance

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,700
of the sum of wi epsilon i, which

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,460
is the weighted average of individual epsilons.

28
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,890
Because idiosyncratic shocks are pairwise

29
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,970
uncorrelated across the assets, the variance of the sum

30
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,250
is equal to the sum of variances.

31
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,240
In other words, the variance of the idiosyncratic component

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,345
of portfolio return is a sum across all

33
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:35,470
of the assets of the individual idiosyncratic variances,

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,660
variance of epsilon i times the square of portfolio weight.

35
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,060
Now, let's specialize this result

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,130
to the case of an equally weighted portfolio.

37
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,550
Suppose that each of the portfolio weights, wi,

38
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,000
is equal to 1/N, where N is the number of assets

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,870
in the portfolio.

40
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,490
We're going to need a piece of notation.

41
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,720
We will denote the average idiosyncratic variance

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,730
across all of the assets by sigma i squared bar.

43
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,940
Now, as it is clear from the previous derivation,

44
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,310
the variance of the idiosyncratic component

45
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,350
of portfolio return is equal to 1/N times the average

46
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,630
idiosyncratic variance.

47
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,910
As we let the number of securities increase and N

48
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,530
rises, this number goes to 0.

49
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,620
In other words, as we enlarge the portfolio

50
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,620
by adding more and more assets equally weighted,

51
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,550
the non-systematic component of variance vanishes in the limit.

52
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,550
This result does not depend on the portfolio

53
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,860
being exactly equally weighted.

54
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,040
The same argument can be applied to any well-diversified

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,370
portfolio, as long as the maximum portfolio

56
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,020
weight decreases as the number of assets in the portfolio

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,170
rises.

58
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,300
In other words, all that we require

59
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,390
is that the portfolio weights are more or less evenly

60
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,060
distributed across the assets, but they don't need

61
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,930
to be exactly equally weighted.

62
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,750
What we determined is that in a well-diversified

63
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,440
portfolio for a specific or idiosyncratic risk

64
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,950
can be eliminated as the number of assets in the portfolio

65
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,300
increases.

66
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,960
This is an important property of well-diversified portfolios.

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,980
They don't have idiosyncratic risk, at least

68
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,410
in the limit of a large number of assets.

69
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,890
The only risk that affects well-diversified portfolios

70
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,530
is the factor risk or systematic risk.

71
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,670
This is the kind of risk that cannot be diversified away

72
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,410
by forming portfolios with a large number of assets.

73
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,210
To illustrate, consider the following empirical example.

74
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,820
We construct two portfolios by sorting stocks on their market

75
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,760
capitalization, or market size.

76
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,850
We start in 1926.

77
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,320
Portfolio 1 includes the largest stocks in the US stock market.

78
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,170
This portfolio is based roughly on the top 30% in terms

79
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,190
of market capitalization judging by the distribution of market

80
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,830
cap on the New York Stock Exchange.

81
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,520
In recent years, this portfolio included approximately 500

82
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,060
stocks.

83
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,670
The second portfolio includes the lower tier

84
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,529
in terms of market size.

85
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,020
This portfolio, we can call it mid cap,

86
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,010
includes roughly 1,000 stocks.

87
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,070
These two portfolios are well-diversified.

88
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,420
And by construction, they do not overlap.

89
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,830
A stock can be either in Portfolio 1

90
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,440
or Portfolio 2 or neither.

91
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,410
They have no securities in common.

92
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,630
If return distribution in the stock market

93
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,420
can be described by a single factor model, then

94
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,780
both of these portfolios, being well-diversified,

95
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,450
will have exposure to the common factor

96
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,130
and no idiosyncratic risk.

97
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,100
In other words, these two portfolios

98
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,890
should be perfectly correlated with each other.

99
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,420
The exposures to the common factor

100
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,250
may not be the same in magnitude,

101
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,340
but the returns should be perfectly correlated.

102
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,270
As we look at the scatter plot of the return distribution

103
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,510
of the mid cap portfolio on the vertical axis

104
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,370
relative to the large cap portfolio

105
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,860
on the horizontal axis, we observe

106
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,710
that, indeed, the returns on these two portfolios

107
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,810
are highly correlated with each other.

108
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,330
They're not perfectly correlated as a single factor

109
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,140
model will predict, but the correlation is very high.

110
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,840
And the R squared of a regression

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,410
of the mid cap return on the large cap return is over 90%.

112
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,740
Observe that the slope of the line that

113
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,440
captures the linear relation between these two portfolios

114
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,360
is higher than 1.

115
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,480
What this means is that the mid cap portfolio

116
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,880
has a higher loading on the common factor

117
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,570
than the large cap portfolio.

118
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,320
These results suggest that there is a significant common factor

119
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,370
that affects returns on large cap and mid cap stocks.

120
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,120
And even though these two portfolios

121
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,380
have no securities in common, their returns with each other

122
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,540
are highly correlated.

123
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,570
We also see that the correlation is not perfect.

124
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,900
And that suggests that perhaps there are other factors at play

125
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,540
here and a single factor model does not fully

126
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,430
describe the return distribution of these two portfolios.
